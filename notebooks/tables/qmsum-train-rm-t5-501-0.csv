The group was worrying that Brexit would cut down the support from the EU to the UK, thus putting the Wales Universities in great dilemma. Besides, the fact was that the less fiscal support from the EU, the less foreign students would apply for the Wales universities. The members talked about several possible solutions, for instance, adjusting the syllabus to better meet both the students' and the lecturers' needs and providing them with better career prospects. What also mattered was the immigration policy which would be alluring to the foreign students if being reconsidered carefully.","[   37  1338    47    81     8  5043    11   569  2860    13 13857     6

Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams AM emphasized that the government would not relax any of the restrictions with regard to education and new measuring methods would be applied concerning performance rate, etc. It was suggested that there was an increase in the number of attendances to the open hubs and the ability to test, to trace and to quarantine would be critical to the next phase. Moreover, the meeting agreed that schools should remain in contact with children in need and continue to identify vulnerable children with emotional and mental health difficulties.

Also, Marketing suggested the remote control to be the shape of cool fruits with fewer buttons because they should target the young user group that would be keen on new device innovation. Next, User Interface presented on the sample of sensor speaker but didn't recommend it because it didn't add too much functional design and it was not mature to use it as a speech recognition engine. The group agreed with User Interface to have two scroll wheels with turbo button and switch on button. Then, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the component design. The group decided to use a power source with spongy design and double curve chip for easy handling.

Then they had some discussions on how to balance the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, and the importance of simplicity in the Bill. This discussion led to a further discussion on the implementation phase for that nuancing, and its impact on other services. After sharing all of these positive feedbacks in terms of the Bill and its intention, they had some discussions on unintended consequences for this Bill.

Addressing big differences in the amount of early childhood education in different parts of Wales, the team answered the needs of the families and the children in certain areas. Then the meeting discussed the demand-driven approach to the childcare market, asserting there was no evidence of cutting on the foundation. Then the team answered the question about the demand of Welsh language skills by obviously differing degrees and hiring workers of different backgrounds. When talking about the competition with existing formal childcare, the team believed it was expected. Then the team alleged they would do more investment and reviews on the programme, and discussed how to tackle the technical issues with HMRC. Next the extra cost was not yet defined, the price tag was announced to be £2.5million. Finally, the meeting discussed the necessity of adding eligibility checks to the beginning of the programme, and the details on the sample ""Flying Start'' programme.","[   37  1338  2579  7574    13     8   711   992    30   778  7352  1073

The former was abandoned while the latter was adopted by the group for its novelty and feasibility. After discussing the functions, the group thought they were approaching the high-end market, so they could push up the price.

Besides, the quality framework should cover higher education to make it compatible with ENQA, which was considered as highly important going forward, since it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards to avoid specific problems for the HE sector in Wales. Although it might cause a stir, a change must be made in the new situation.

Sometimes it was hard to make a final judgment since the futures of the students were unpredictable but the fee and access plans could always be one of the drivers for some of the improvements. In the meantime, constant efforts had been put into communications with  a range of stakeholders to continue developing legislative proposals to assure the fee.","[  304  1525   216    89    77  1955  5422    31     7   822     6 10976

This prototype had microphone arrays for the speech recognition system and switch for controlling. The remote control needed rechargeable batteries, but the type and the number of batteries were not sure. This prototype cost fifteen dollars and it was high above the budget. The second prototype was basically the same as the first one. However, it used buttons to navigate and enter. This one cost four dollars. The remote control had different modules for different groups of people. The set might use a material like titanium or lithium.

To start with, Philip Blaker generally introduced the position of Qualification Wales in the education system, focusing on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment. Meanwhile, Gareth Pierce talked about the process of making teaching materials available bilingually, both in English and Welsh language. It was suggested that both versions be carried out simultaneously to ensure equity. Concerns were also raised about whether the procedure would delay the availability of the textbooks. What's more, the meeting also discussed the digitalization of materials. The council worried that the lack of digital accessibility and digital literacy would have an impact on pupils' performance. However, it was concluded that the process would widen the access to different materials. The meeting also talked about the timetable of the curriculum reform and the general plan for the future, mainly on the qualification and teaching materials.","[   37  1338    47     3  4894    81     8  6537    13 19533     7    11

First, Jayne Bryant asked how confident they were that teachers and others working in those educational settings would be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill. Alastair Birch responded that training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear. The awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there. The second question was about whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust. Alastair Birch disagreed that this was a matter of mistrust. He thought if a professional believed there was significant harm to that child, they were under a duty to report that to social care.","[  290   130  3536   192   746  4382    30  1113    30  1073     5  1485

The Act had partly fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. Kirsty Williams AM also pointed out that new methods should be included to further regulate, co-ordinating and fund the sector. When it comes to the future of the Act, the meeting agreed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of the civic mission, and students' interests must be fully preserved. Meanwhile, some participants argued that HEFCW's powers were inflexible and fee plans from private providers were hard to regulate. Kirsty Williams AM agreed that a more flexible connection between the regulating sectors and the others should be attained. Besides, the meeting also talked about managing risk and agreed that the Act, in the future should include more alternative providers for students who were receiving long-term support. In the end, Kirsty Williams AM praised the contribution from overseas providers in supporting transnational education in Wales and agreed that rights of students in Wales should always be put in the first place.","[   37  1338   344     8  4351     6  5209  2449    11  2855  3201    11

User Interface argued that they should discard the existing standard, and only keep the basic and user-friendly functions like channel selection, volume and enter key. The group then discussed the source of power whether to have a charger or solar power. Although solar energy was fancy and environmentally friendly, the cost was much higher than using a charger. The group faced some difficulty when deciding the target group whether for the young end or for the lower end of the age range who have more money than sense.

Basically, they relied on the school categorization system. What's more, in Kirsty's opinion, the school improvement service was a risk-based approach. Luckily, the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation. It would continue to evolve because it had to be consistent with their overall approach to school improvement and raising standards. What they needed now was a more strategic, longer term approach to reach changes in a school rather than some of the easy-to-fix items that made a school as if it was doing better.","[ 2150    12 10976     7    17    63     6   132   130     3     9  1196

Project Manager introduced the aim of the second meeting and new project requirement. Project Manager said that the team did not need to pay attention to teletext and lighting adaptive. Then Industrial Designer, User Interface and Marketing gave presentations respectively. Industrial Designer proposed that they could add software functionalities on programmable chips and could use the FPGA. User Interface focused on reducing the number of buttons and recommended navigation buttons. Marketing discussed a lot of ideas including using a speech recogniser, the size of the remote control and lighting adaptive options. In the end they discussed some topics like teletext and accessing the Internet.","[   86     8  3071     6   372   724   410  9972    11  6812    81     8

Sally Jenkins said that this was not punitive approaches from social services, and their aim was to get in and get out, and let families find their own solutions. Third question was about whether there was a need for legislation if natural behavior and the culture was changing. Huw David mentioned that there was already existing legislation that covered those children who were abused by parents. However, the threshold was not clear enough for children. Then they outlined the practical ways in which social services' interaction with parents would change because of this proposed law.
