[{"input": "For this reason I quote the\narticle in its entirety:--\n\n     \"The individual man of any country in which active outdoor life,\n     abstinence, hunting of wild game, and exposure to all weathers\n     are the habits of life, is more than a match for the private\n     soldier of a regular army, who is taken from the plough or from\n     cities, and this is the case doubly as much when the field of\n     operations is a difficult country, and when the former is, and\n     the latter is not, acclimatised.On the one hand, the former is\n     accustomed to the climate, knows the country, and is trained to\n     long marches and difficulties of all sorts inseparable from his\n     daily life; the latter is unacclimatised, knows nothing of the\n     country, and, accustomed to have his every want supplied, is at a\n     loss when any extraordinary hardships or difficulties are\n     encountered; he has only his skill in his arms and discipline in\n     his favour, and sometimes that skill may be also possessed by his\n     foe.The native of the country has to contend with a difficulty\n     in maintaining a long contest, owing to want of means and want of\n     discipline, being unaccustomed to any yoke interfering with\n     individual freedom.The resources of a regular army, in\n     comparison to those of the natives of the country, are infinite,\n     but it is accustomed to discipline.In a difficult country, when\n     the numbers are equal, and when the natives are of the\n     description above stated, the regular forces are certainly at a\n     very great disadvantage, until, by bitter experience in the\n     field, they are taught to fight in the same irregular way as\n     their foes, and this lesson may be learnt at a great cost.I\n     therefore think that when regular forces enter into a campaign\n     under these conditions, the former ought to avoid any unnecessary\n     haste, for time does not press with them, while every day\n     increases the burden on a country without resources and\n     unaccustomed to discipline, and as the forces of the country,\n     unprovided with artillery, never ought to be able to attack\n     fortified posts, any advance should be made by the establishment\n     of such posts.All engagements in the field ought, if possible,\n     to be avoided, except by corps raised from people who in their\n     habits resemble those in arms, or else by irregular corps raised\n     for the purpose, apart from the routine and red-tape inseparable\n     from regular armies.The regular forces will act as the back-bone\n     of the expedition, but the rock and cover fighting will be done\n     better by levies of such specially raised irregulars.For war\n     with native countries, I think that, except for the defence of\n     posts, artillery is a great incumbrance, far beyond its value.It\n     is a continual source of anxiety.Its transport regulates the\n     speed of the march, and it forms a target for the enemy, while\n     its effects on the scattered enemy is almost _nil_.An advance of\n     regular troops, as at present organised, is just the sort of\n     march that suits an active native foe.The regulars' column must\n     be heaped together, covering its transport and artillery.The\n     enemy knows the probable point of its destination on a particular\n     day, and then, knowing that the regulars cannot halt definitely\n     where it may be chosen to attack, it hovers round the column like\n     wasps.The regulars cannot, from not being accustomed to the\n     work, go clambering over rocks, or beating covers after their\n     foes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Therefore I conclude that in these wars[1] regular troops\n     should only act as a reserve; that the real fighting should be\n     done either by native allies or by special irregular corps,\n     commanded by special men, who would be untrammelled by\n     regulations; that, except for the defence of posts, artillery\n     should be abandoned.It may seem egotistical, but I may state\n     that I should never have succeeded against native foes had I not\n     had flanks, and front, and rear covered by irregular forces.Whenever either the flanks, or rear, or front auxiliaries were\n     barred in their advance, we turned the regular forces on that\n     point, and thus strengthening the hindered auxiliaries, drove\n     back the enemy.We owed defeats, when they occurred, to the\n     absence of these auxiliaries, and on two occasions to having\n     cannon with the troops, which lost us 1600 men.The Abyssinians,\n     who are the best of mountaineers, though they have them, utterly\n     despise cannon, as they hinder their movements.I could give\n     instance after instance where, in native wars, regular troops\n     could not hold their own against an active guerilla, and where,\n     in some cases, the disasters of the regulars were brought about\n     by being hampered by cannon.No one can deny artillery may be\n     most efficient in the contention of two regular armies, but it is\n     quite the reverse in guerilla warfare.The inordinate haste which\n     exists to finish off these wars throws away many valuable aids\n     which would inevitably accrue to the regular army if time was\n     taken to do the work, and far greater expense is caused by this\n     hurry than otherwise would be necessary.All is done on the\n     '_Veni, vidi, vici_' principle.It may be very fine, but it is\n     bloody and expensive, and not scientific.I am sure it will occur\n     to many, the times we have advanced, without proper breaches,\n     bridges, etc., and with what loss, assaulted.It would seem that\n     military science should be entirely thrown away when combating\n     native tribes.I think I am correct in saying that the Romans\n     always fought with large auxiliary forces of the invaded country\n     or its neighbours, and I know it was the rule of the Russians in\n     Circassia.\"[1] In allusion more particularly to the Cape and China.Perhaps Gordon was influenced by the catastrophes in South Africa when\nhe sent the following telegram at his own expense to the Cape\nauthorities on 7th April 1881: \"Gordon offers his services for two\nyears at L700 per annum to assist in terminating war and administering\nBasutoland.\"To this telegram he was never accorded even the courtesy\nof a negative reply.It will be remembered that twelve months earlier\nthe Cape Government had offered him the command of the forces, and\nthat his reply had been to refuse.The incident is of some interest as\nshowing that his attention had been directed to the Basuto question,\nand also that he was again anxious for active employment.His wish for\nthe latter was to be realised in an unexpected manner.He was staying in London when, on visiting the War Office, he casually\nmet the late Colonel Sir Howard Elphinstone, an officer of his own\ncorps, who began by complaining of his hard luck in its just having\nfallen to his turn to fill the post of Engineer officer in command at\nthe Mauritius, and such was the distastefulness of the prospect of\nservice in such a remote and unattractive spot, that Sir Howard went\non to say that he thought he would sooner retire from the service.In\nhis impulsive manner Gordon at once exclaimed: \"Oh, don't worry\nyourself, I will go for you; Mauritius is as good for me as anywhere\nelse.\"The exact manner in which this exchange was brought about has\nbeen variously described, but this is the literal version given me by\nGeneral Gordon himself, and there is no doubt that, as far as he could\nregret anything that had happened, he bitterly regretted the accident\nthat caused him to become acquainted with the Mauritius.In a letter\nto myself on the subject from Port Louis he said: \"It was not over\ncheerful to go out to this place, nor is it so to find a deadly sleep\nover all my military friends here.\"In making the arrangements which\nwere necessary to effect the official substitution of himself for\nColonel Elphinstone, Gordon insisted on only two points: first, that\nElphinstone should himself arrange the exchange; and secondly that no\npayment was to be made to him as was usual--in this case about\nL800--on an exchange being effected.Sir Howard Elphinstone was thus\nsaved by Gordon's peculiarities a disagreeable experience and a\nconsiderable sum of money.Some years after Gordon's death Sir Howard\nmet with a tragic fate, being washed overboard while taking a trip\nduring illness to Madeira.Like everything else he undertook, Gordon determined to make his\nMauritius appointment a reality, and although he was only in the\nisland twelve months, and during that period took a trip to the\ninteresting group of the Seychelles, he managed to compress an immense\namount of work into that short space, and to leave on record some\nvaluable reports on matters of high importance.He found at Mauritius\nthe same dislike for posts that were outside the ken of headquarters,\nand the same indifference to the dry details of professional work that\ndrove officers of high ability and attainments to think of resigning\nthe service sooner than fill them, and, when they did take them, to\npass their period of exile away from the charms of Pall Mall in a\nstate of inaction that verged on suspended animation.In a passage\nalready quoted, he refers to the deadly sleep of his military friends,\nand then he goes on to say in a sentence, which cannot be too much\ntaken to heart by those who have to support this mighty empire, with\nenemies on every hand--\"We are in a perfect Fools' Paradise about our\npower.We have plenty of power if we would pay attention to our work,\nbut the fault is, to my mind, the military power of the country is\neaten up by selfishness and idleness, and we are trading on the\nreputation of our forefathers.When one sees by the newspapers the\nEmperor of Germany sitting, old as he is, for two long hours\ninspecting his troops, and officers here grudging two hours a week for\ntheir duties, one has reason to fear the future.\"During his stay at Mauritius he wrote three papers of first-rate\nimportance.One of them on Egyptian affairs after the deposition of\nIsmail may be left for the next chapter, and the two others, one on\ncoaling stations in the Indian Ocean, and the second on the\ncomparative merits of the Cape and Mediterranean routes come within\nthe scope of this chapter, and are, moreover, deserving of special\nconsideration.With regard to the former of these two important\nsubjects, Gordon wrote as follows, but I cannot discover that anything\nhas been done to give practical effect to his recommendations:--\n\n     \"I spoke to you concerning Borneo and the necessity for coaling\n     stations in the Eastern seas.Taking Mauritius with its large\n     French population, the Cape with its conflicting elements, and\n     Hongkong, Singapore, and Penang with their vast Chinese\n     populations, who may be with or against us, but who are at any\n     time a nuisance, I would select such places where no temptation\n     would induce colonists to come, and I would use them as maritime\n     fortresses.For instance, the only good coaling place between\n     Suez and Adelaide would be in the Chagos group, which contain a\n     beautiful harbour at San Diego.My object is to secure this for\n     the strengthening of our maritime power.These islands are of\n     great strategical importance _vis a vis_ with India, Suez, and\n     Singapore.Remember Aden has no harbour to speak of, and has the\n     need of a garrison, while Chagos could be kept by a company of\n     soldiers.It is wonderful our people do not take the views of our\n     forefathers.They took up their positions at all the salient\n     points of the routes.We can certainly hold these places, but\n     from the colonial feelings they have almost ceased to be our own.By establishing these coaling stations no diplomatic\n     complications could arise, while by their means we could unite\n     all our colonies with us, for we could give them effective\n     support.The spirit of no colony would bear up for long against\n     the cutting off of its trade, which would happen if we kept\n     watching the Mediterranean and neglected the great ocean routes.The cost would not be more than these places cost now, if the\n     principle of heavily-armed, light-draught, swift gunboats with\n     suitable arsenals, properly (not over) defended, were followed.\"Chagos as well as Seychelles forms part of the administrative group of\nthe Mauritius.The former with, as Gordon states, an admirable port in\nSan Diego, lies in the direct route to Australia from the Red Sea, and\nthe latter contains an equally good harbour in Port Victoria Mahe.The\nSeychelles are remarkably healthy islands--thirty in number--and\nGordon recommended them as a good place for \"a man with a little money\nto settle in.\"He also advanced the speculative and somewhat\nimaginative theory that in them was to be found the true site of the\nGarden of Eden.The views Gordon expressed in 1881 as to the diminished importance of\nthe Mediterranean as an English interest, and the relative superiority\nof the Cape over the Canal route, on the ground of its security, were\nless commonly held then than they have since become.Whether they are\nsound is not to be taken on the trust of even the greatest of\nreputations; and in so complicated and many-sided a problem it will be\nwell to consider all contingencies, and to remember that there is no\nreason why England should not be able in war-time to control them\nboth, until at least the remote epoch when Palestine shall be a\nRussian possession.\"I think Malta has very much lost its importance.The\n     Mediterranean now differs much from what it was in 1815.Other\n     nations besides France possess in it great dockyards and\n     arsenals, and its shores are backed by united peoples.Any war\n     with Great Britain in the Mediterranean with any one Power would\n     inevitably lead to complications with neutral nations.Steam has\n     changed the state of affairs, and has brought the Mediterranean\n     close to every nation of Europe.War in the Mediterranean is _war\n     in a basin_, the borders of which are in the hands of other\n     nations, all pretty powerful and interested in trade, and all\n     likely to be affected by any turmoil in that basin, and to be\n     against the makers of such turmoil.In fact, the Mediterranean\n     trade is so diverted by the railroads of Europe, that it is but\n     of small importance.The trade which is of value is the trade\n     east of Suez, which, passing through the Canal, depends upon its\n     being kept open.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.If the entrance to the Mediterranean were\n     blocked at Gibraltar by a heavy fleet, I cannot see any advantage\n     to be gained against us by the fleets blocked up in it--at any\n     rate I would say, let our _first care_ be for the Cape route, and\n     secondly for the Mediterranean and Canal.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.The former route\n     entails no complications, the latter endless ones, coupled with a\n     precarious tenure.Look at the Mediterranean, and see how small\n     is that sea on which we are apparently devoting the greater part\n     of our attention.The\n     Resident, according to existing orders, reports to Bombay, and\n     Bombay to _that_ Simla Council, which knows and cares nothing\n     for the question.A special regiment should be raised for its\n     protection.\"While stationed in the Mauritius, Gordon attained the rank of\nMajor-General in the army, and another colonel of Engineers was sent\nout to take his place.During the last three months of his residence\nhe filled, in addition to his own special post, that of the command of\nall the troops on the station, and at one time it seemed as if he\nmight have been confirmed in the appointment.But this was not done,\nowing, as he suggested, to the \"determination not to appoint officers\nof the Royal Artillery or Engineers to any command;\" but a more\nprobable reason was that Gordon had been inquiring about and had\ndiscovered that the colonists were not only a little discontented, but\nhad some ground for their discontent.By this time Gordon's\nuncompromising sense of justice was beginning to be known in high\nofficial quarters, and the then responsible Government had far too\nmany cares on its shoulders that could not be shirked to invite others\nfrom so remote and unimportant a possession as the Mauritius.Even before any official decision could have been arrived at in this\nmatter, fate had provided him with another destination.Two passages have already been cited, showing the overtures first made\nby the Cape Government, and then by Gordon himself, for his employment\nin South Africa.On 23rd\nFebruary 1882, when an announcement was made by myself that Gordon\nwould vacate his command in a few weeks' time, the Cape Government\nagain expressed its desire to obtain the use of his services, and\nmoreover recollected the telegram to which no reply had been sent.Sir\nHercules Robinson, then Governor of the Cape, sent the following\ntelegram to the Colonial Secretary, the Earl of Kimberley:--\n\n     \"Ministers request me to inquire whether H.M.'s Government would\n     permit them to obtain the services of Colonel Charles Gordon.Ministers desire to invite Colonel Gordon to come to this Colony\n     for the purpose of consultation as to the best measures to be\n     adopted with reference to Basutoland, in the event of Parliament\n     sanctioning their proposals as to that territory, and to engage\n     his services, should he be willing to renew the offer made to\n     their predecessors in April 1881, to assist in terminating the\n     war and administering Basutoland.\"Lord Kimberley then sent instructions by telegraph to Durban, and\nthence by steamer, sanctioning Gordon's employment and his immediate\ndeparture from the Mauritius.The increasing urgency of the Basuto\nquestion induced the Cape Government to send a message by telegraph to\nAden, and thence by steamer direct to Gordon.In this message they\nstated that \"the services of some one of proved ability, firmness, and\nenergy,\" were required; that they did not expect Gordon to be bound by\nthe salary named in his own telegram, and that they begged him to\nvisit the Colony \"at once\"--repeating the phrase twice.All these\nmessages reached Gordon's hands on 2nd April.Two days later he\nstarted in the sailing vessel _Scotia_, no other ship being\nobtainable.The Cape authorities had therefore no ground to complain of the\ndilatoriness of the man to whom they appealed in their difficulty,\nalthough their telegram was despatched 3rd of March, and Gordon did\nnot reach Cape Town before the 3rd of May.It will be quite understood\nthat Gordon had offered in the first place, and been specially invited\nin the second place, to proceed to the Cape, for the purpose of\ndealing with the difficulty in Basutoland.He was to find that, just\nas his mission to China had been complicated by extraneous\ncircumstances, so was his visit to the Cape to be rendered more\ndifficult by Party rivalries, and by work being thrust upon him which\nhe had several times refused to accept, and for the efficient\ndischarge of which, in his own way, he knew he would never obtain the\nrequisite authority.Before entering upon this matter a few words may be given to the\nfinancial agreement between himself and the Cape Government.The first\noffice in 1880 had carried with it a salary of L1500; in 1881 Gordon\nhad offered to go for L700; in 1882 the salary was to be a matter of\narrangement, and on arrival at Cape Town he was offered L1200 a year.He refused to accept more than L800 a year; but as he required and\ninsisted on having a secretary, the other L400 was assigned for that\npurpose.In naming such a small and inadequate salary Gordon was under\nthe mistaken belief that his imperial pay of L500 a year would\ncontinue, but, unfortunately for him, a new regulation, 25th June\n1881, had come into force while he was buried away in the Mauritius,\nand he was disqualified from the receipt of the income he had earned.Gordon was very indignant, more especially because it was clear that\nhe was doing public service at the Cape, while, as he said with some\nbitterness, if he had started an hotel or become director of a\ncompany, his pay would have gone on all the same.The only suggestion\nthe War Office made was that he should ask the Cape Government to\ncompensate him, but this he indignantly refused.In the result all his\nsavings during the Mauritius command were swallowed up, and I believe\nI understate the amount when I say that his Cape experience cost him\nout of his own pocket from first to last five hundred pounds.That sum\nwas a very considerable one to a man who never inherited any money,\nand who went through life scorning all opportunities of making it.But on this occasion he vindicated a principle, and showed that\n\"money was not his object.\"As Gordon went to the Cape specially for the purpose of treating the\nBasutoland question, it may be well to describe briefly what that\nquestion was.Basutoland is a mountainous country, difficult of\naccess, but in resources self-sufficing, on the eastern side of the\nOrange Free State, and separated from Natal and Kaffraria, or the\nTranskei division of Cape Colony, by the sufficiently formidable\nDrakensberg range.Its population consisted of 150,000 stalwart and\nfreedom-loving Highlanders, ruled by four chiefs--Letsea, Masupha,\nMolappo, and Lerothodi, with only the three first of whom had Gordon\nin any way to deal.Notwithstanding their numbers, courage, and the\nnatural strength of their country, they owed their safety from\nabsorption by the Boers to British protection, especially in 1868, and\nthey were taken over by us as British subjects without any formality\nthree years later.They do not seem to have objected so long as the\ntie was indefinite, but when in 1880 it was attempted to enforce the\nregulations of the Peace Preservation Act by disarming these clans,\nthen the Basutos began a pronounced and systematic opposition.Letsea\nand Lerothodi kept up the pretence of friendliness, but Masupha\nfortified his chief residence at Thaba Bosigo, and openly prepared for\nwar.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.That war had gone on for two years without result, and the total\ncost of the Basuto question had been four millions sterling when\nGordon was summoned to the scene.Having given this general\ndescription of the question, it will be well to state the details of\nthe matters in dispute, as set forth by Gordon after he had examined\nall the papers and heard the evidence of the most competent and\nwell-informed witnesses.His memorandum, dated 26th May 1882, read as follows:--\n\n     \"In 1843 the Basuto chiefs entered into a treaty with Her\n     Majesty's Government, by which the limits of Basutoland were\n     recognised roughly in 1845.The Basuto chiefs agreed by\n     convention with Her Majesty's Government to a concession of land\n     on terminable leases, on the condition that Her Majesty's\n     Government should protect them from Her Majesty's subjects.\"In 1848 the Basuto chiefs agreed to accept the Sovereignty of\n     Her Majesty the Queen, on the understanding that Her Majesty's\n     Government would restrain Her Majesty's subjects in the\n     territories they possessed.\"Between 1848 and 1852, notwithstanding the above treaties, a\n     large portion of Basutoland was annexed by the proclamation of\n     Her Majesty's Government, and this annexation was accompanied by\n     hostilities, which were afterwards decided by Sir George Cathcart\n     as being undertaken in support of unjustifiable aggression.\"In 1853, notwithstanding the treaties, Basutoland was abandoned,\n     leaving its chiefs to settle as they could with the Europeans of\n     the Free State who were settled in Basutoland and were mixed up\n     with the Basuto people.\"In 1857, the Basutos asked Her Majesty's Government to arbitrate\n     and settle their quarrels.\"In 1858 the Free State interfered to protect their settlers, and\n     a war ensued, and the Free State was reduced to great\n     extremities, and asked Her Majesty's Government to mediate.This\n     was agreed to, and a frontier line was fixed by Her Majesty's\n     Government.\"In 1865 another war broke out between the Free State and the\n     Basutos, at the close of which the Basutos lost territory, and\n     were accepted as British subjects by Her Majesty's Government for\n     the second time, being placed under the direct government of Her\n     Majesty's High Commissioner.\"In 1871 Basutoland was annexed to the _Crown_ Colony of the Cape\n     of Good Hope, without the Basutos having been consulted.\"In 1872 the _Crown_ Colony became a colony with a responsible\n     Government, and the Basutos were placed virtually under another\n     power.The Basutos asked for representation in the Colonial\n     Parliament, which was refused, and to my mind here was the\n     mistake committed which led to these troubles.\"Then came constant disputes, the Disarmament Act, the Basuto\n     War, and present state of affairs.\"From this chronology there are four points that stand out in\n     relief:--\n\n     \"1.That the Basuto people, who date back generations, made\n     treaties with the British Government, which treaties are equally\n     binding, whether between two powerful states, or between a\n     powerful state and a weak one.That, in defiance of the treaties, the Basutos lost land.That, in defiance of the treaties, the Basutos, without being\n     consulted or having their rights safeguarded, were handed over to\n     another power--the Colonial Government.That that other power proceeded to enact their disarmament, a\n     process which could only be carried out with a servile race, like\n     the Hindoos of the plains of India, and which any one of\n     understanding must see would be resisted to the utmost by any\n     people worth the name; the more so in the case of the Basutos,\n     who realised the constant contraction of their frontiers in\n     defiance of the treaties made with the British Government, and\n     who could not possibly avoid the conclusion that this disarmament\n     was only a prelude to their extinction.\"The necessary and inevitable result of the four deductions was\n     that the Basutos resisted, and remain passively resisting to this\n     day.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\"The fault lay in the British Government not having consulted the\n     Basutos, their co-treaty power, when they handed them over to the\n     Colonial Government.They should have called together a national\n     assembly of the Basuto people, in which the terms of the transfer\n     could have been quietly arranged, and this I consider is the root\n     of all the troubles, and expenses, and miseries which have sprung\n     up; and therefore, as it is always best to go to the root of any\n     malady, I think it would be as well to let bygones be bygones,\n     and to commence afresh by calling together by proclamation a\n     Pitso of the whole tribe, in order to discuss the best means of\n     sooner securing the settlement of the country.I think that some\n     such proclamation should be issued.By this Pitso we would know\n     the exact position of affairs, and the real point in which the\n     Basutos are injured or considered themselves to be injured.\"To those who wish for the total abandonment of Basutoland, this\n     course must be palatable; to those who wish the Basutos well, and\n     desire not to see them exterminated, it must also be palatable;\n     and to those who hate the name of Basutoland it must be\n     palatable, for it offers a solution which will prevent them ever\n     hearing the name again.\"This Pitso ought to be called at once.All Colonial officials\n     ought to be absent, for what the colony wants is to know what is\n     the matter; and the colony wishes to know it from the Basuto\n     people, irrespective of the political parties of the Government.\"Such a course would certainly recommend itself to the British\n     Government, and to its masters--the British people.\"Provided the demands of the Basutos--who will, for their own\n     sakes, never be for a severing of their connection with the\n     colony, in order to be eventually devoured by the Orange Free\n     State--are such as will secure the repayment to the colony of all\n     expenses incurred by the Colonial Government in the maintenance\n     of this connection, and I consider that the Colonial Government\n     should accept them.\"With respect to the Loyals, there are some 800 families, the\n     cost of keeping whom is on an average one shilling per diem each\n     family, that is L40 per diem, or L1200 per month, and they have\n     been rationed during six months at cost of L7200.Their claims\n     may therefore be said to be some L80,000.Now, if these 800\n     families (some say half) have claims amounting to L30 each\n     individually (say 400 families at L30), L12,000 paid at once\n     would rid the colony of the cost of subsistence of these\n     families, viz.L600 a month (the retention of them would only add\n     to the colonial expenditure, and tend to pauperise them).\"I believe that L30,000 paid at once to the Loyals would reduce\n     their numbers to one-fourth what they are now.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.It is proposed to\n     send up a Commission to examine into their claims; the Commission\n     will not report under two months, and there will be the delay of\n     administration at Cape Town, during all which time L1200 a month\n     are being uselessly expended by the colony, detrimentally to the\n     Loyals.Therefore I recommend (1) that the sum of L30,000 should\n     be at once applied to satisfy the minor claims of the Loyals; (2)\n     that this should be done at once, at same time as the meeting of\n     the National Pitso.\"The effect of this measure in connection with the meeting of the\n     National Pitso would be very great, for it would be a positive\n     proof of the good disposition of the Colonial Government.The\n     greater claims could, if necessary, wait for the Parliamentary\n     Commission, but I would deprecate even this delay, and though for\n     the distribution of the L30,000 I would select those on whom the\n     responsibility of such distribution could be put, without\n     reference to the Colonial Government, for any larger sums perhaps\n     the colonial sanction should be taken.\"I urge that this measure of satisfying the Loyals is one that\n     presses and cannot well wait months to be settled.\"In conclusion, I recommend (1) that a National Pitso be held;\n     (2) that the Loyals should at once be paid off.1 nothing could\n     be asked for detrimental to colonial interests, whose Government\n     would always have the right of amending or refusing any demands,\n     and that by recommendation No.2 a great moral effect would be\n     produced at once, and some heavy expenses saved.\"Attached to this memorandum was the draft of a proclamation to the\nchiefs, etc., of Basutoland, calling on them to meet in Pitso or\nNational Assembly without any agent of the Colonial Government being\npresent.It was not very surprising that such a policy of fairness and\nconsideration for Basuto opinion, because so diametrically opposite to\neverything that Government had been doing, should have completely\ntaken the Cape authorities aback, nor were its chances of being\naccepted increased by Gordon entrusting it to Mr Orpen, whose policy\nin the matter had been something more than criticised by the Ministers\nat that moment in power at the Cape.Gordon's despatch was in the\nhands of the Cape Premier early in June, and the embarrassment he felt\nat the ability and force with which the Basuto side of the question\nwas put by the officer, who was to settle the matter for the Cape\nGovernment, was so great that, instead of making any reply, he passed\nit on to Lord Kimberley and the Colonial Office for solution.It was\nnot until the 7th of August that an answer was vouchsafed to Gordon on\nwhat was, after all, the main portion of his task in South Africa.In\nthe interval Gordon was employed on different military and\nadministrative matters, for he had had thrust on him as a temporary\ncharge the functions of Commandant-General of the Cape forces, which\nhe had never wished to accept, but it will be clearer to the reader to\nfollow to the end the course of his Basuto mission, which was the\nessential cause of his presence in South Africa.On the 18th July the Ministers requested Gordon to go up to\nBasutoland.At that moment, and indeed for more than three weeks\nlater, Gordon had received no reply to the detailed memorandum already\nquoted.He responded to this request with the draft of a convention\nthat would \"save the susceptibilities of Mr Orpen between whom and\nMasupha any _entente_ would seem impossible.\"The basis of that\nconvention was to be the semi-independence of the Basutos, but its\nfull text must be given in order to show the consistency, as well as\nthe simplicity, of Gordon's proposed remedy of a question that had\ngone on for years without any prospect of termination.CONVENTION BETWEEN COLONY, CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, AND THE CHIEF AND\n                            PEOPLE OF BASUTOLAND.\"The Colonial Government having nominated as their\n     representatives, Colonel C. Griffiths and Dr J. W. Matthews, the\n     Basuto nation having nominated the Chief Letsea Moshesh and\n     Masupha Moshesh as their representatives, the following\n     convention has been agreed upon between these representatives:--\n\n     \"Art.There shall be a complete amnesty on both sides to all\n     who have taken part in the late hostilities.The question of the succession to Molappo Moshesh's\n     chieftainship shall be decided by the Chief of the Basuto Nation.The Colonial Government engages to respect the integrity\n     of the Basuto nation within the limits to be hereafter decided\n     upon, and also to use its best endeavours to have these limits\n     respected by the Orange Free State.The Colonial Government will appoint a Resident to the\n     Basuto nation, with two sub-residents.The Resident will", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "The Supreme Council of Basutoland will consist of the\n     leading chiefs and the Resident; the minor chiefs of Basutoland\n     will form a council with the sub-residents.These minor councils\n     can be appealed against by any non-content to the Supreme\n     Council.A hut-tax will be collected of 10s.per hut by the\n     chiefs, and will be paid to the Resident and sub-resident.The\n     sum thus collected will be used in paying the Resident L2000 a\n     year, all included: the sub-residents L1200 a year, all included;\n     in providing for the education of people (now costing L3320 a\n     year); in making roads, etc.The chiefs collecting hut-tax will be paid 10 per cent.The frontier line will be placed under headmen, who will\n     be responsible that no thieving be permitted, that spoors are\n     followed up.For this these headmen will be paid at the rate of\n     L20 to L60 per annum, according to the length of frontier they\n     are responsible for.All passes must be signed by Residents or sub-residents\n     for the Orange Free State, or for the Cape Colony.\"_Query_--Would it be advisable to add chiefs and missionaries\n     after sub-residents?Colonial warrants will be valid in Basutoland, the\n     chiefs being responsible that prisoners are given up to Resident\n     or sub-residents.All communications between Basutoland and the Orange\n     Free State to be by and through the Resident.This Convention to be in quadruplicate, two copies\n     being in possession of the Colonial Government, and two copies in\n     possession of the Basuto chiefs.On signature of this Convention, and on the fulfilment\n     of Art.1, amnesty clause, the Colonial Government agrees to\n     withdraw the military forces and the present magisterial\n     administration.\"To this important communication no answer was ever vouchsafed, but on\n7th August, long after it was in the hands of Ministers, Mr Thomas\nScanlan, the Premier, wrote a long reply to the earlier memorandum of\n26th May.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.The writer began by quoting Lord Kimberley's remarks on that\nmemorandum, which were as follows:--\n\n     \"I have received the memorandum on the Basuto question by\n     Major-General Gordon.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.I do not think it necessary to enter upon a\n     discussion of the policy suggested in this memorandum, but it\n     will doubtless be borne in mind by your Ministers that, as I\n     informed you by my telegram of the 6th of May last, H.M.'s\n     Government cannot hold out any expectation that steps will be\n     taken by them to relieve the colony of its responsibilities in\n     Basutoland.\"The interpretation placed, and no doubt correctly placed, on that\ndeclaration of Government policy was that under no circumstances was\nit prepared to do anything in the matter, and that it had quite a\nsufficient number of troubles and worries without the addition of one\nin remote and unimportant Basutoland.Having thus got out of the\nnecessity of discussing this important memorandum, under the cloak of\nthe Colonial Office's decision in favour of inaction, the Premier went\non to say that he was \"most anxious to avoid the resumption of\nhostilities on the one hand or the abandonment of the territory on the\nother.\"There was an absolute ignoring in this statement of Gordon's\ndeliberate opinion that the only way to solve the difficulty was by\ngranting Basutoland semi-independence on the terms of a Convention\nproviding for the presence of a British Resident, through whom all\nexternal matters were to be conducted.At the same time Mr Scanlan\ninformed Gordon that he was sending up Mr Sauer, then Secretary for\nNative Affairs, who was a nominee of Mr Orpen, the politician whose\npolicy was directly impugned.On Mr Sauer reaching King William's Town, where Gordon was in\nresidence at the Grand Depot of the Cape forces, he at once asked him\nto accompany him to Basutoland.Gordon at first declined to do this on\ntwo grounds, viz.that he saw no good could ensue unless the\nconvention were granted, and also that he did not wish Mr Sauer, or\nany other representative of the Cape Government, as a companion,\nbecause he had learnt that \"Masupha would only accept his proposed\nvisit as a private one, and then only with his private secretary and\ntwo servants.\"After some weeks' hesitation Gordon was induced by Mr Sauer to so far\nwaive his objection as to consent to accompany him to Letsea's\nterritory.This Basuto chief kept up the fiction of friendly relations\nwith the Cape, but after Gordon had personally interviewed him, he\nbecame more than ever convinced that all the Basuto chiefs were in\nleague.Mr Sauer was of opinion that Letsea and the other chiefs might\nbe trusted to attack and able to conquer Masupha.There was no\npossibility of reconciling these clashing views, but Gordon also\naccompanied Mr Sauer to Leribe, the chief town of Molappo's territory,\nnorth of, and immediately adjoining that of, Masupha.Here Gordon\nfound fresh evidence as to the correctness of his view, that all the\nBasuto leaders were practically united, and he wrote a memorandum,\ndated 16th September, which has not been published, showing the\nhopelessness of getting one chief to coerce the others.Notwithstanding the way he had been treated by the Cape Government,\nwhich had ignored all his suggestions, Gordon, in his intense desire\nto do good, and his excessive trust in the honour of other persons,\nyielded to Mr Sauer's request to visit Masupha, and not only yielded\nbut went without any instructions or any prior agreement that his\nviews were to prevail.The consequence was that Mr Sauer deliberately\nresolved to destroy Gordon's reputation as a statesman, and to ensure\nthe triumph of his own policy by an act of treachery that has never\nbeen surpassed.While Gordon went as a private visitor at the special invitation of\nMasupha to that chief's territory, Mr Sauer, who was well acquainted\nwith Gordon's views, and also the direct author of Gordon's visit at\nthat particular moment, incited Letsea to induce Lerothodi to attack\nMasupha.At the moment that the news of this act of treachery reached\nMasupha's ears, Gordon was a guest in Masupha's camp, and the first\nconstruction placed upon events by that chief was, that Gordon had\nbeen sent up to hoodwink and keep him quiet, while a formidable\ninvasion was plotted of his territory.When Masupha reported this news\nto Gordon, he asked what he advised him to do, and it has been\nestablished that the object of the question was to ascertain how far\nGordon was privy to the plot.Gordon's candid reply--\"Refuse to have\nany dealings with the Government until the forces are withdrawn,\" and\nhis general demeanour, which showed unaffected indignation, convinced\nMasupha of his good faith and innocence of all participation in the\nplot.A very competent witness, Mr Arthur Pattison (letter in _The Times_,\n20th August 1885), bears this testimony: \"Gordon divined his character\nmarvellously, and was the only man Masupha had the slightest regard\nfor.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Masupha, if you treat him straightforwardly, is as nice a man as\npossible, and even kind and thoughtful; but, if you treat him the\nother way, he is a fiend incarnate.\"Had Masupha not been thus convinced, Gordon's death was decided on,\nand never in the whole course of his career, not even when among the\nTaepings on the day of the Wangs' murder in Soochow, nor among\nSuleiman's slave-hunters at Shaka, was he in greater peril than when\nexposed by the treacherous proceedings of Sauer and Orpen to the wrath\nof Masupha.On his return in safety he at once sent in his\nresignation, but those who played him false not merely never received\ntheir deserts for an unpardonable breach of faith to a loyal\ncolleague, but have been permitted by a lax public opinion at the Cape\nto remain in the public service, and are now discharging high and\nresponsible duties.Gordon's mission to the leading Basuto chief, and the policy of\nconciliation which he consistently and ably advocated from the\nbeginning to the end of his stay at the Cape, were thus failures, but\nthey failed, as an impartial writer like Mr Gresswell says, solely\nbecause \"of Mr Sauer's intrigues behind his back.\"It is only\nnecessary to add what Gordon himself wrote on this subject on his\nreturn, and to record that practically the very policy he advocated\nwas carried into force, not by the Cape Government, but over its head\nby the British Government, two years later, in the separation of\nBasutoland from the Cape Colony, and by placing it in its old direct\ndependence under the British Crown.\"I have looked over the Cape papers; the only thing that is\n     misrepresented, so far as I could see in a ten minutes' glance at\n     them, is that Sauer says I knew of his intentions of sending an\n     expedition against Masupha.He puts it thus: 'Gordon knew that an\n     expedition was being organised against Masupha.'He gives\n     apparently three witnesses that I knew well.It is quite true;\n     but read the words._I knew Sauer was going_ to try the useless\n     expedient of an expedition against Masupha, and _before he did\n     so_ we _agreed I should go and try and make peace_.While\n     carrying on this peace mission, Sauer sends the expedition.So\n     you see he is verbally correct; yet the deduction is false; in\n     fact, who would ever go up with peace overtures to a man who was\n     to be attacked during those overtures, as Masupha was?Garcia\n     knew well enough what a surprise it was to him and me when we\n     heard Sauer was sending the expedition.Garcia was with me at the\n     time.\"And again, when at Jaffa, General Gordon adds further, on the 27th of\nJuly 1883:--\n\n     \"I saw Masupha one day at 10 A.M., and spoke to him; Sauer was\n     twenty miles away.I came back, and wrote to Sauer an\n     account of what had passed; before I sent it off I received a\n     letter from Sauer.I believe it is wished to be made out that\n     Sauer wrote this letter after he had heard what had passed\n     between Masupha and me.This is not the case, for Sauer, having\n     let me go to Masupha, changed his mind and wrote the letter, but\n     this letter had nothing to do with my interview with Masupha.\"With this further quotation of Gordon's own words I may conclude the\ndescription of the Basuto mission, which, although deemed a failure at\nthe time, was eventually the direct cause of the present\nadministrative arrangement in that important district of South Africa.\"In order you should understand the position of affairs, I recall\n     to your memory the fact that Scanlan, Merriman, and yourself all\n     implied to me doubts of Orpen's policy and your desire to remove\n     him; that I deprecated any such change in my favour; that I\n     accepted the post of Commandant-General on Merriman's statement\n     that the Government desired me to eradicate the red-tape system\n     of the colonial forces; that I made certain reports to the\n     Government upon the settlement of the Basuto question in May and\n     July, showing my views; that the Government were aware of the\n     great difference between my views and those of Orpen, both by\n     letter and verbally to Merriman; also to my objections to go up.Sauer was told by me the same thing.I conversed with him _en\n     route_, and I told him if I visited Masupha I could not\n     afterwards fight him, for I would not go and spy upon his\n     defences.Sauer asked me to go to Masupha; he knew my views; yet\n     when I was there negotiating, he, or rather Orpen, moved\n     Lerothodi to attack Masupha, who would, I believe, have come to\n     terms respecting the acceptance of magistrates, a modified\n     hut-tax, and border police.The reported movement of Lerothodi\n     prevented my coming to any arrangement.I told Masupha, when he\n     sent and told me of Lerothodi's advance, not to answer the\n     Government until the hostile movements had ceased.The Government\n     sent me up, knowing my views, and against my wish, and knowing I\n     was not likely to mince matters.There are not more than two\n     Europeans in Basutoland who believe in Orpen or his policy, while\n     the natives have lost all confidence in him.Sauer shut his eyes\n     to all this, and has thrown in his lot with Orpen.Masupha is a\n     sincere man, and he does not care to have placed with him\n     magistrates, against whom are complaints, which Sauer ignores.To\n     show you I was in earnest, I offered to remain as magistrate with\n     Masupha for two years, so much did I desire a settlement of the\n     Basuto question.I did not want nor would I have taken the post\n     of Governor's Agent.The chiefs and people desire peace, but not\n     at any price.They have intelligence enough to see through\n     wretched magistrates like some of those sent up into the native\n     territories.They will accept a convention like the one I sent\n     down to the Colonial Secretary on the 19th of July, and no other.I do not write this to escape being a scapegoat--in fact, I like\n     the altar--only that you may know my views.As long as the\n     present magistrates stay there, no chance exists for any\n     arrangement.As to the Premier's remark that I would not fight\n     against Masupha, is it likely I could fight against a man with\n     whom I am life and soul?Would I fight against him because he\n     would not be controlled by some men like ---- and ----?Even\n     suppose I could sink my conscience to do so, what issue would\n     result from the action of undisciplined and insubordinate troops,\n     who are difficult to keep in order during peace-time, and about\n     whom, when I would have made an example of one officer, a\n     Minister telegraphs to me to let him down easy.I beg to recall\n     to you that Her Majesty's Government disapproved of the former\n     Basuto war; therefore, why should I, who am an outsider to the\n     colony, even pretend I could make war against a noble people, who\n     resist magistrates of no capacity?The Government were well\n     warned by me, and they cannot, therefore, plead being led\n     astray.\"Intimately connected with the Basuto question was the larger one of\nthe right treatment to be generally extended to the natives, and on\nthat subject General Gordon drew up, on 19th October 1882, the\nfollowing masterly note, which elicited the admiration of one of the\nCape Premiers, Mr Merriman, who said--\"As a Colony we must try to\nfollow out the ideas sketched by General Gordon.\"The following is the full text of this interesting and valuable state\npaper:--\n\n                           THE NATIVE QUESTION.The native question of South Africa is not a difficult one to\n     an outsider.The difficulty lies in procuring a body of men who\n     will have strength of purpose to carry out a definite policy with\n     respect to the natives.The strained relations which exist between the colonist and\n     the native are the outcome of employing, as a rule, magistrates\n     lacking in tact, sympathy, and capacity to deal with the natives,\n     in the Government not supervising the action of these\n     magistrates, and in condoning their conduct, while acknowledging\n     those faults which come to their cognisance.The Colonial Government act in the nomination of native\n     magistrates as if their duties were such as any one could\n     fulfil, instead of being, as they are, duties requiring the\n     greatest tact and judgment.There can be no doubt but that in a\n     great measure, indeed one may say entirely, disturbances among\n     the natives are caused by the lack of judgment, or of honesty, or\n     of tact, on the part of the magistrates in the native\n     territories.There may be here and there good magistrates, but\n     the defects of the bad ones re-act on the good ones.Revolt is\n     contagious and spreads rapidly among the natives.One may say no supervision, in the full sense of the term,\n     exists over the actions of magistrates in native territories.They report to headquarters what suits them, but unless some very\n     flagrant injustice is brought to light, which is often condoned,\n     the Government know nothing.The consequence is that a continual\n     series of petty injustices rankle in the minds of the natives,\n     eventually breaking out into a revolt, in the midst of which\n     Government does not trouble to investigate the causes of such\n     revolt, but is occupied in its suppression.The history of the\n     South African wars is essentially, as Sir G. Cathcart puts it,\n     \"Wars undertaken in support of unjustifiable acts.\"Sir Harry\n     Smith was recalled for supporting an inefficient official of the\n     now Free State Territory.Any one who chooses can investigate the\n     causes of the late wars, and will find out that they arose in a\n     great measure from the ignorance of the Government, their support\n     of incapable officials, and their weakness in not investigating\n     causes before they proceeded to coercion.The Duke of\n     Wellington said that any fool could govern by that means.And it\n     is still more rotten when Government governs by the rule of\n     coercion without the power of coercion except at great expense.A properly constituted Commission of independent men\n     proceeding to the native territories, not accepting the\n     hospitality of those whose conduct they _go_ to investigate, not\n     driving through the territories in hot haste, as is the manner of\n     some Ministers, but a Commission who would patiently and\n     fearlessly inquire into every detail of administration, into\n     every grievance, is the _sine qua non_ of any quiet in the native\n     territories.This Commission should detail on brass plates the\n     _modus vivendi_, the limits of territory of each district chief,\n     and a body of trustees should be appointed to watch over any\n     infraction of such charter.It must be borne in mind that these native territories cost\n     the Colony for administration some L9000 per annum for\n     administration of magistracies; the receipts are some L3000,\n     leaving a deficit of some L6000 per annum.To this deficit has to\n     be added some L150,000 for regular troops.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.The last rebellion of\n     Transkei ended in capture of some L60,000 worth of cattle, and\n     that from natives of Colony driven into rebellion, and cost\n     Government of Colony with Basuto war nearly L4,000,000.It is\n     surely worth while, from a financial point of view, to\n     investigate the administration of the Transkei.The present state of the Transkei is one of seething\n     discontent and distrust which the rivalry of the tribes alone\n     prevents breaking out into action, to be quelled again at great\n     expense and by the ruin of the people, and upset of all\n     enterprise to open up the country.Throughout the Transkei is one\n     general clamour against the Government for broken promises, for\n     promises made and never kept.Magistrates complain no answers are\n     given to their questions; things are allowed to drift along as\n     best they can.A fair open policy towards the Pondos would obtain\n     from them all the Colony could require, but as things are now,\n     the Pondos are full of distrust, and only want the chance to turn\n     against the Colony.There are in Transkei 399,000 natives, and\n     2800 Europeans.Therefore, for the benefit of these 2800\n     Europeans, 399,000 natives are made miserable, and an expenditure\n     of L210,000 is incurred by the Colony with the probability of\n     periodical troubles.However disagreeable it might be, the Commission of\n     Investigation should inquire into the antecedents of each\n     magistrate, and also his capabilities.With respect to Basutoland, it is understood that no revenue\n     from that country is to go to the Colony, therefore it can be no\n     object to Colony to insist on the installation of magistrates in\n     that country.If the magistrates of Transkei are the cause of\n     discontent among the natives, then what object is there in\n     insisting on their installation in Basutoland?The Pondos, a far\n     inferior people, are happy under their own chiefs--far happier\n     than the natives of Transkei.Why should the Colony insist on\n     sending men who are more likely to goad the Basutos into\n     rebellion than anything else?The administration of Basutoland is\n     on a scale costing L30,000 per annum.It is argued that should the Colony go to war with Masupha\n     the other chiefs would hold aloof.A war\n     with Masupha means a war with the Basuto nation, with a rising in\n     the Transkei, and perhaps in Pondoland, and would affect Natal\n     and Her Majesty's Government.The only remedy is the sending up of his Excellency the\n     Governor, or of some high neutral officer, to Basutoland, and the\n     calling together of the people to decide on their future\n     government and connection with Colony.Or, should the British\n     Government refuse this small concession, which could not involve\n     it, then the Colony should send up an independent Commission to\n     meet the Basuto people, and arrange a _modus vivendi_.Whichever\n     course is followed it is a _sine qua non_ that the present\n     officials in Basutoland should be relieved at once, as they have\n     lost the confidence both of Europeans and natives.The Basutos\n     desire peace, and it is an error to describe their demeanour as\n     aggressive.It is not unnatural that after what they have\n     suffered from the hands of Colonial Government they should desire\n     at least as nearly as much self-government as the Pondos enjoy.Certainly the present magisterial administration of the Transkei\n     is very far from being a blessing, or conducive to peace.Nothing can possibly be worse than the present state of\n     affairs in native administration, and the interests of the Colony\n     demand a vertebrate government of some sort, whoever it may be\n     composed of, instead of the invertebrate formation that is now\n     called a government, and which drifts into and creates its own\n     difficulties.\"_P.S._--Should Her Majesty's Government manage to arrange with\n     Basutos in a satisfactory manner, 10,000 splendid cavalry could\n     be counted on as allies in any contingencies in Natal, etc.\"The vital part of Gordon's Cape experiences was the Basuto mission,\nand as it is desirable that it should not be obscured by other\nmatters, I will only touch briefly on his work as Commandant-General,\napart from that he performed as Adviser to the Cape Government in the\nBasuto difficulty.The post of Commandant-General was forced upon him\nin the first weeks of his arrival from the Mauritius by the combined\nurgency of Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor, and Mr Merriman, then\nPremier.Much against his inclination, Gordon agreed to fill the post\nthus thrust upon him, but only for a time.It entailed an infinity of\nwork and worry.His instructions were to break up a red-tape system,\nand such a task converted every place-holder into his enemy.Still\nthat opposition rather made his task attractive than otherwise, but in\na little time he found that this opposition would not stop short of\ninsubordination, and that to achieve success it would be necessary to\ncashier a good many officers as a wholesome example.It was while\nmatters were in this preliminary stage that Mr Merriman's ministry\nwent out of office, and was succeeded by another under Mr Scanlan.The\nmeasures which were favoured by the one were opposed by the other, and\nGordon soon saw that the desire for a thorough reorganisation of the\nCape forces, which, if properly supported, he could have carried out,\nwas no longer prevalent among the responsible Ministers.Still he drew\nup an elaborate programme for the improvement of the Colonial Regular\nforces, by which they might be increased in numbers and improved in\nefficiency, at the same time that the annual expenditure was reduced.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.This document shows that mastery of detail which was one of his most\nstriking characteristics, and if his advice had been taken, the Cape\nwould have acquired nearly 4000 troops at no greater cost than it\nalready expended on 1600.In a second memorandum, he not only showed\nthe necessity existing for that larger force, but also how, by\nadministrative alterations in the Transkeian provinces, its cost might\nbe diminished and most conveniently discharged.Although I do not\nquote these two documents, I cannot help saying that Gordon, in the\nwhole course of his life, never wrote anything more convincing than\nthe advice he gave the Cape Government, which, owing to local\njealousies and the invincible bulwark of vested interests, was never\ncarried into effect, although the Basuto question was subsequently\ncomposed on Gordon's lines by the Imperial Government, and there has\nbeen peace there during all the other South African troubles.The closing passages between Gordon and the Cape Ministers need only\nbe briefly referred to.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.Gordon resigned because he saw he could do no\ngood in Basutoland; the Cape Premier accepted his resignation because\nGordon \"would not fight the Basutos.\"The intercommunications were\nmuch more numerous, but that is their pith.Gordon came down to Cape\nTown and sailed for England on 14th October, after having been five\nand a half months in South Africa.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.He had been treated by the Cape\nauthorities without any regard for justice, and little for courtesy.The leading paper even admitted this much when it observed that \"at\nleast General Gordon was entitled to the treatment of a gentleman.\"But the plain truth was that Gordon was summoned to South Africa and\nemployed by the Government, not as was ostentatiously proclaimed, and\nas he himself believed, for the attainment of a just solution of the\nBasuto difficulty, and for the execution of much-needed military\nreforms, but in order that his military experience and genius might be\ninvoked for the purpose of overthrowing Masupha and of annexing\nBasutoland, which two years of war and five millions of money had\nfailed to conquer.Hence their disappointment and resentment when\nGordon proclaimed that justice was on the side of Masupha; that under\nno circumstances would he wage war with him; and that the whole origin\nof the trouble lay in the bad policy, the incompetent magistrates, and\nthe insubordinate military officers of the Cape Government.The\nindictment was a terrible one; it was also true in every line and\nevery particular.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Having thus vindicated his own character, as well as the highest\nprinciples of Government, Gordon left the Cape a poorer and a wiser\nman than he was on his arrival.I have explained the personal loss he\nincurred through the inadequacy of his pay and the cutting-off of his\narmy allowance.It has been stated that when he had taken his passage\nfor England he was without any money in his pocket, and that he\nquaintly said to a friend: \"Do you think it is right for a\nMajor-General of the British Army to set out on a journey like this\nwithout sixpence in his pocket?\"There is nothing improbable in such\nan occurrence, and it was matched only sixteen months later, when he\nwas on the point of starting for Khartoum in the same impecunious\ncondition.Gordon arrived in England on 8th November, and after some\ncorrespondence with the King of the Belgians, which will be referred\nto later in connection with the Congo mission, he again left England\non 26th December.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.On this occasion he was going to carry out a\nlong-cherished desire to visit and reside in the Holy Land, so that he\nmight study on the spot the scenes with which his perfect knowledge of\nthe Bible--his inseparable companion--had made him in an extraordinary\ndegree familiar.In the best sense of the word, he was going to take a\nholiday.There was to be absolute quiet and rest, and at the same time\na congenial occupation.He sailed for Jaffa as a guest on one of Sir\nWilliam Mackinnon's steamers, but he at once proceeded to Jerusalem,\nwhere he lived alone, refusing to see any one, with his books as\ncompanions, and \"mystifying people as to what he was doing.\"During\nhis stay at Jerusalem he entered with much zest and at great length\ninto the questions of the various sites in the old Jewish capital.I\ndo not propose to follow the course of his labours in that pursuit, as\nseveral works contain between them, I should say, every line he wrote\non the subject, and the general reader cannot be expected to take any\ninterest in abstruse and much-debated theological and topographical\nquestions.But even in the midst of these pursuits he did not lose his\nquickness of military perception.After a brief inspection he at once\ndeclared that the Russian Convent commanded the whole city, and was in\nitself a strong fortress, capable of holding a formidable garrison,\nwhich Russia could despatch in the guise of priests without any one\nbeing the wiser.From Jerusalem, when the heat became great, he\nreturned to Jaffa, and his interest aroused in worldly matters by the\nprogress of events in Egypt, and the development of the Soudan danger,\nwhich he had all along seen coming, was evoked by a project that was\nbrought under his notice for the construction across Palestine of a\ncanal to the head of the Gulf of Akabah.In a letter to myself he thus\ndilates upon the scheme:--\n\n     \"Here is the subject which I am interested in if it could be\n     done.We are in Egypt supporting an unpopular sovereign, whose\n     tenure ends with departure of our troops.We offer no hope to the\n     people of any solace by this support, and by the supporting of\n     the Turco-Circassian Pashas, who I know by experience are\n     _hopeless_.We neither govern nor take responsibility; yet we\n     support these vampires.We are getting mixed up with the question of whether the\n     interest of L90,000,000 will be paid or not.We are mixed up with the Soudan, where we provoked the\n     rebellion, and of the responsibility of which government we\n     cannot rid ourselves.We are in constant and increasing hot water with the French,\n     and we gain no benefit from it, for the Canal will remain theirs.*       *       *       *       *\n\n     \"On the other hand, if we get a Firman from Sultan for the\n     Palestine Canal--\n\n     \"1.We lose the sacred sites of Jordan River,

Gordon's own declarations as to the superior\nmerits of the Cape route, nor does Sir Henry Gordon much strengthen\nthe case when, perceiving the inconsistency, he goes out of his way to\ndeclare that Gordon only meant the Palestine canal to be a commercial\nroute.Any attempt to limit its usefulness could not destroy the\ncharacter claimed for it by its promoters, as an equally short and\nmore

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "In the midst of his interesting researches near Mount Carmel, a\nsummons from the outer world reached Gordon in the form of a letter\nfrom Sir William Mackinnon, telling him that the King of the Belgians\nnow called on him to fulfil a promise he had made some years before.When Gordon first returned from the Cape the King of the Belgians\nwrote, reminding him of his old promise, dating from 1880, to enter\ninto his service on the Congo, and stating that the difficulty of\nhaving an internationally recognised Congo flag, which Gordon had made\na _sine qua non_ of his appointment, could be most speedily solved by\nGordon joining him as counsellor at once.This Gordon could not agree\nto, and he went to Palestine, there to await the King's summons,\nwhich came by Sir William Mackinnon's note in October 1883.It then\nbecame necessary for Gordon to obtain the official permission of his\nGovernment to take up this post, of the exact nature of which the\nForeign Office had been already informed, both by General Gordon and\nKing Leopold.Gordon at once telegraphed to the War Office for the leave rendered\nnecessary by his being on the active list, and that Department\nreplied, asking for particulars.When these were furnished through the\nForeign Office the decision was announced that \"the Secretary of State\ndeclines to sanction your employment on the Congo.\"The telegraph\nclerk, more discerning or considerate than Her Majesty's Government,\naltered \"declines\" into \"decides,\" and Gordon, in happy ignorance of\nthe truth, proceeded with all possible despatch _via_ Acre and Genoa\nto Brussels, which he reached on New Year's Day, 1884.That very night\nhe wrote me a short note saying, \"I go (_D.V._) next month to the\nCongo, but keep it secret.\"Such things cannot be kept secret, and\nfour days later a leading article in _The Times_ informed his\ncountrymen of Gordon's new mission.On reaching Brussels the mistake in the telegram was discovered, and\nGordon here learnt that his Congo mission was vetoed.Then came the\ndifficulty to know what was to be done.Without leave he could not go\nanywhere without resigning his commission; he was not qualified for a\npension, and there were engagements he had voluntarily contracted that\nhe would not see broken, and persons who would suffer by his death,\nwhose interests he was in every way bound to safeguard.Therefore, if\nhe was to carry out his engagement with the King of the Belgians, it\nwas obviously necessary that he should resign the British Army, and\nthat the King should compensate him for his loss.The King said at\nonce: \"Retire from the army and I will compensate you,\" but in a\nmatter of such importance to others Gordon felt nothing should be left\nto chance, and that a definite contract should be made.For this he\nhad neither the patience nor the business knowledge, and he delegated\nthe task of arranging the matter to his brother, Sir Henry Gordon, who\nnegotiated with the late Sir William Mackinnon as representing the\nKing.They agreed that the value of Gordon's pension if commuted would\nbe L7288, and the King of the Belgians was to provide that sum, which\nwas to be paid into a trust fund.In this and every other matter the\nKing behaved towards Gordon in the most generous and cordial manner,\nfurnishing a marked contrast with the grudging and parsimonious spirit\nof the British Government towards Gordon in China, at the Cape, and\nnow again when destined for the Congo.All the arrangements connected with this subject were made in three\ndays, and while Gordon gave instructions for his will to be prepared\nfor the disposal of the trust fund after his death, he wrote the same\nday (6th January) to Mr H. M. Stanley, then acting for the King on the\nCongo, announcing his own appointment, offering to \"serve willingly\nwith or under him,\" and fixing his own departure from Lisbon for 5th\nof February._Dis aliter visum._ For the moment he worked up some\nenthusiasm in his task.\"We will kill the slave-traders in their\nhaunts\"; and again, \"No such efficacious means of cutting at root of\nslave trade ever was presented as that which God has, I trust, opened\nout to us through the kind disinterestedness of His Majesty,\" are\npassages in the same letter, yet all the time there is no doubt his\nheart and his thoughts were elsewhere.They were in the Soudan, not on\nthe Congo.The night of this letter he crossed from Brussels, and went straight\nto his sister's house, long the residence, and, practically speaking,\nthe home of his family, 5 Rockstone Place, Southampton.On the 7th of\nthe month--that is, the same day as he arrived--he wrote the formal\nletter requesting leave to resign his commission in the Queen's army,\nand also stating, with his usual candour, that King Leopold II.had\nguaranteed him against any pecuniary loss.To that letter it may at\nonce be stated that no reply was ever sent.Even the least sympathetic\nofficial could not feel altogether callous to a voluntary proposition\nto remove the name of \"Chinese\" Gordon from the British army list, and\nthe sudden awakening of the public to the extraordinary claims of\nGeneral Gordon on national gratitude, and his special fitness to deal\nwith the Soudan difficulty warned the authorities that a too rigid\napplication of office rules would not in his case be allowed.By no\nindividual effort, as has been too lightly granted by some writers,\nbut by the voice of the British people was it decided that not only\nshould Gordon have leave to go to the Congo, without resigning his\ncommission, but also that he should be held entitled to draw his pay\nas a British general while thus employed.But this was not the whole\ntruth, although I have no doubt that the arrangement would have been\ncarried out in any case.In their dilemma the Government saw a chance\nof extrication in the person of Gordon, the one man recognised by the\npublic and the press as capable of coping with a difficulty which\nseemed too much for them.The whole truth, therefore, was that the\nCongo mission was to wait until after Gordon had been sent to, and\nreturned from, the Soudan.He was then to be placed by the British\nGovernment entirely at the disposal of the King of the Belgians.As\nthis new arrangement turned on the assent of the King, it was vital to\nkeep it secret during the remainder of the 15th and the whole of the\n16th of that eventful January.When Gordon arrived at Waterloo Station, at a little before two\no'clock on 15th January, and was met there by myself, I do not think\nthat he knew definitely what was coming, but he was a man of\nextraordinary shrewdness, and although essentially unworldly, could\nsee as clearly and as far through a transaction as the keenest man of\nbusiness.What he did know was that the army authorities were going to\ntreat him well, but his one topic of conversation the whole way to\nPall Mall was not the Congo but the Soudan.To the direct question\nwhether he was not really going, as I suspected, to the Nile instead\nof the Congo, he declared he had no information that would warrant\nsuch an idea, but still, if the King of the Belgians would grant the\npermission, he would certainly not be disinclined to go there first.You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and\nthe ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone.These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony\ncase or box.In it are some of the most useful organs of the body.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may\nsay it is two stories high.The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b\nd[=o]'m[)e]n).In the chest, are the heart and the lungs.In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs.The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you\nwill say, when I tell you what it can do.The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called\ngastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and\napples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up\nthe bag and lay it away on a shelf for a few hours, and then show you\nthat the beef had disappeared, so had the apples, so had the potatoes,\nthe bread and milk, sugar, and salt, and the bag was filled only with a\nthin, grayish fluid?Now, your stomach and mine are just such magical bags.We put in our breakfasts, dinners, and suppers; and, after a few hours,\nthey are changed.The strong\nmuscles that form the outside of the stomach have been squeezing the\nfood, rolling it about, and mixing it together, until it has all been\nchanged to a thin, grayish fluid.A soldier was once shot in the side in such a way that when the wound\nhealed, it left an opening with a piece of loose skin over it, like a\nlittle door leading into his stomach.A doctor who wished to learn about the stomach, hired him for a servant\nand used to study him every day.He would push aside the little flap of skin and put into the stomach any\nkind of food that he pleased, and then watch to see what happened to it.In this way, he learned a great deal and wrote it down, so that other\npeople might know, too.In other ways, also, which it would take too\nlong to tell you here, doctors have learned how these magical food-bags\ntake care of our food.WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED?Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal\nand milk to make you grow into a big man or woman.Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part\nof milk?That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do\nnot look like milk.If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and\nbusy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to\neach part and feed it.When the food in the stomach is mixed and prepared, it is ready to be\nsent through the body; some is carried to the bones, some to the\nmuscles, some to the nerves and brain, some to the skin, and some even\nto the finger nails, the hair, and the eyes.Each part needs to be fed\nin order to grow.WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD?Children need each day to make larger and larger bones, larger muscles,\nand a larger skin to cover the larger body.Every day, each part is also wearing out a little, and needing to be\nmended by some new food.People who have grown up, need their food for\nthis work of mending.One way to take care of the stomach is to give it only its own work to\ndo.I have seen some children who want to\nmake their poor stomachs work all the time.They are always eating\napples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to\nrest.If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a\nmachine would.The stomach can not work well, unless it is quite warm.If a person\npours ice-water into his stomach as he eats, just as the food is\nbeginning to change into the gray fluid of which you have learned, the\nwork stops until the stomach gets warm again.ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.You remember about the man who had the little door to his stomach.Sometimes, the doctor put in wine, cider, brandy, or some drink that\ncontained alcohol, to see what it would do.It was carried away very\nquickly; but during the little time it stayed, it did nothing but harm.It injured the gastric juice, so that it could not mix with the food.If the doctor had put in more alcohol, day after day, as one does who\ndrinks liquor, sores would perhaps have come on the delicate lining of\nthe stomach.Sometimes the stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the\ndrinker dies.If the stomach can not do its work well, the whole body\nmust suffer from want of the good food it needs.[C]\n\n\nTOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare the food, before it goes into\nthe stomach.Tobacco makes the mouth very dry, and more saliva has to\nflow out to moisten it.But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva, and that must not be\nswallowed.It must be spit out, and with it is sent the saliva that was\nneeded to help prepare the food.Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad sores in the mouth, and often\ncauses a disease of the throat.You can tell where some people have been, by the neatness and comfort\nthey leave after them.You can tell where the tobacco-user has been, by the dirty floor, and\nstreet, and the air made unfit to breathe, because of the smoke and\nstrong, bad smell of old tobacco from his pipe and cigar and from his\nbreath and clothes.What is the upper room of this box called?What do the stomach and the gastric juice do\n          to the food we have eaten?How did anybody find out what the stomach\n          could do?Why must all the food we eat be changed?Why do people who are not growing need food?How does the habit of spitting injure a\n          person?FOOTNOTE:\n\n[Footnote C: The food is partly prepared by the liver and some other\norgans.][Illustration: N]OW that you know how the body is fed, you must next\nlearn what to feed it with; and what each part needs to make it grow and\nto keep it strong and well.A large part of your body is made of water.So you need, of course, to\ndrink water, and to have it used in preparing your food.Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs\nin the ground.From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our\nhouses.Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well\nfrom which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket.Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead\nmixed with it.Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you\ndrank it.Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or\na stable.If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by\nit.It is better to go thirsty, until you can get good water.A sufficient quantity of pure water to drink is just as important for\nus, as good food to eat.We could not drink all the water that our bodies need.We take a large\npart of it in our food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in beefsteak\nand bread.You remember the bone that was nothing but crumbling\nlime after it had been in the fire.We can not eat lime; but the grass and the grains take it out of the\nearth.Then the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk, and in the\nmilk we drink, we get some of the lime to feed our bones.[Illustration: _Lime being prepared for our use._]\n\nIn the same way, the grain growing in the field takes up lime and other\nthings that we need, but could not eat for ourselves.The lime that thus\nbecomes a part of the grain, we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and\nother foods.Animals need salt, as children who live in the country know very well.They have seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick up the salt that\nthe farmer gives them.Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out places where there are salt\nsprings, and go in great herds to get the salt.We, too, need some salt mixed with our food.If we did not put it in,\neither when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the\nfood itself.FLESH-MAKING FOODS.Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making\nfoods.These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat\nand eggs.Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground.Meat\nand eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the\ncattle and hens eat.We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to\nkeep us warm and make us comfortable.So we must have certain kinds of\nfood that will make fat.[Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._]\n\nThere are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other\nthings in this world.When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is\nfat badly made, and in the wrong place.The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from\nfat-making foods.In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as\nin cold countries people need such food all the time.The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many\nwalrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat.You would not be well\nunless you ate some fat or butter or oil.Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat\nmeat.As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of\nfood.Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food.Fat meat\ncomes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane,\nmaple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and\nstarch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains.Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.The\nstarch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it\ncan mix with the blood and help feed the body.As the sun ripens fruit,\nit changes its starch to sugar.You can tell this by the difference in\nthe taste of ripe and unripe apples.Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more\nsugar than is good for them.You would starve if fed only on sugar.We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it\nwere not for the poison with which it is often.Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such.There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves.If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all\ndissolve and disappear.Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of\nwater; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and\ndisappear.If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white\nearth.Candy-makers often put it\ninto candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar.Why is it not safe to drink water that has been\n          standing in lead pipes?Why is the water of a well that is near a drain\n          or a stable, not fit to drink?What is said of the fat made by alcohol?HOW FOOD BECOMES PART OF THE BODY.[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:\n\n          Roast beef,\n          Potatoes,\n          Tomatoes,\n          Squash,\n          Bread,\n          Butter,\n          Salt,\n          Water,\n          Peaches,\n          Bananas,\n          Oranges,\n          Grapes.What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to\nmake up this dinner?The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.Cooking prepares them to\nbe easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach.If they were not cooked,\nthis work would be very hard.Instead of going on quietly and without\nletting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in\nthe overworked stomach.The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had\ncooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it.When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your\nhomes.You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as\nmuch as food poorly cooked.\"A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good\ndoctor.\"As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called\nsaliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it.Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the\nstarch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken\ninto the blood.You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar.Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker.The cracker is made mostly of\nstarch, because wheat is full of starch.At first, the cracker is dry\nand tasteless.Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is\nchanging the starch into sugar.All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva\nmay be able to mix with it.Otherwise, the starch may not be changed;\nand if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have\nmore than its share to do.If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its\nwork, the stomach will have extra work.But it will find it hard to do\nmore than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain.It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as\nplain as words.We have two passages leading down our throats.One is to the lungs, for\nbreathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way?The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube.It has\nat its top a little trap-door.This opens when we breathe and shuts when\nwe swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage\nbehind, which leads to the stomach.If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door\nhas to open, and some bit of food may slip in.The windpipe will not\npass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back.Then we say the food\nchokes us.If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the\nperson will die.HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down\ninto the stomach.There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric\njuice, until it is all a gray fluid.Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which\nleads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into\nthe blood.The heart pumps it out with the blood\ninto the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle,\nand skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts\nthat may be broken.Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be\nmended?If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave\nthem a while, do you think they would grow together?But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone\nin the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it\nbone food every day, until it had grown together again.So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body.What is the first thing to do to our food?What is the first thing to do after taking the\n          food into your mouth?How can you prove that saliva turns starch into\n          sugar?What happens if the food is not chewed and\n          mixed with the saliva?What must you be careful about, when you are\n          swallowing?What happens to the food after it is\n          swallowed?What carries the food to every part of the\n          body?[Illustration: H]ERE are the names of some of the different kinds of\nfood.If you write them on the blackboard or on your slates, it will\nhelp you to remember

no\ncigars, either, to be smoked after dinner.If these are good things, we\nought to have had them._We should eat in order to grow strong and keep\n          strong._\n\n\nSTRENGTH OF BODY.If you wanted to measure your strength, one way of doing so would be to\nfasten a heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass the rope over a\npulley.Then you might take hold at the other end of the rope and pull\nas hard and steadily as you could, marking the place to which you raised\nthe weight.By trying this once a week, or once a month, you could tell\nby the marks, whether you were gaining strength.We must exercise in the open air, and take pure air into our lungs to\nhelp purify our blood, and plenty of exercise to make our muscles grow.We must eat good and simple food, that the blood may have supplies to\ntake to every part of the body.People used to think that alcohol made them strong.Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone, or nerve, or brain?If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor nerve, nor brain, it can not\ngive you any strength.Some people may tell you that drinking beer will make you strong.The grain from which the beer is made, would have given you strength.If\nyou should measure your strength before and after drinking beer, you\nwould find that you had not gained any.Most of the food part of the\ngrain has been turned into alcohol.The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider.As soon as the\ncider begins to turn sour, or \"hard,\" as people say, alcohol begins to\nform in it.Pure water is good, and apples are good.But the apple-juice begins to\nbe a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it.In\ncider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours\nafter it is pressed out of the apples.None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real\nstrength.Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the\nbrain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted.The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more\nthan they really can.This false feeling of strength lasts only a little\nwhile.When it has passed, men feel weaker than before.A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by\nthe captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places.Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was\nthe custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum.This liquor is\ndistilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol.This rum\nwas given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great\nstorm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give\nthem twice as much rum as usual.[Illustration]\n\nThe captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no\nstronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt\nweaker.So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship.Once out\non the ocean, of course the men could not get any.At first, they did not like it; but the captain was very careful to have\ntheir food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet\nand cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink.By the time they\nhad crossed the ocean, the men said: \"The captain is right.We have\nworked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum.\"We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best\nkind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind.Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can\nnot carry their messages correctly.Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every\nperson ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make\nhim useful and happy.Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to\nwork, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole.Would you\nbe willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been\npoisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a\npalace, and had a million of dollars?If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not\nlet alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it.What things were left out of our bill of fare?Show why drinking wine or any other alcoholic\n          drink will not make you strong.Why do people imagine that they feel strong\n          after taking these drinks?Tell the story which shows that alcohol does\n          not help sailors do their work.What is the best kind of strength to have?How does alcohol affect the strength of the\n          mind?[Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong\nbox which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for\neach of us.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a\nbeef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger.Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water\nthrough a hose upon a burning building.As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the\nworking of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped\nlike hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the\nbody.These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz).Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called\nveins (v[=a]nz).You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist.If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the\nsteady beating of the pulse.This tells just how fast the heart is\npumping and the blood flowing.The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the\nheart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right.Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we\neat and drink, to every part of the body.To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every\npart.So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and\ncarries it to every part of the body.It then leaves with each part,\njust what it needs.As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good\nblood sent to it, to keep it strong.It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood.If we\ntake alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain.There it\naffects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions.When you run, you can feel your heart beating.It gets an instant of\nrest between the beats.Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the\nbody better than a fire could do.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?You know what harm alcohol does to the\nmuscles.Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart?No more than a\nfatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm.Besides, alcohol makes\nthe heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.How does the food we eat reach all parts of the\n          body?How does alcohol in the blood affect the brain?How does exercise in the fresh air help the\n          heart?[Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food\nto every part.It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter\nthat can no longer be used.By the time it is ready to be sent back by\nthe veins, the blood is no longer pure and red.It is dull and bluish in\ncolor, because it is full of impurities.If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look\nblue.If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to\npump out bad blood next time?No, for the heart has neighbors very near\nat hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again.They are in the chest on each side of\nthe heart.When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or\nexpand, to take in the air.Then they contract again, and the air passes\nout through your mouth or nose.The lungs must have plenty of fresh air,\nand plenty of room to work in.[Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._]\n\nIf your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand,\nthey can not take in so much air as they should.Then the blood can not\nbe made pure, and the whole body will suffer.For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one\nof impure air.In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go\nback to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body\nagain.How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can\nnot yet understand.By and by, when you are older, you will learn more\nabout it.You never stop breathing, not even in the night.But if you watch", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "But the lungs are very steady workers, both by night\nand by day.The least we can do for them, is to give them fresh air and\nplenty of room to work in.You may say: \"We can't give them more room than they have.They are\nshut up in our chests.\"I have seen people who wore such tight clothes that their lungs did not\nhave room to take a full breath.If any part of the lungs can not\nexpand, it will become useless.If your lungs can not take in air enough\nto purify the blood, you can not be so well and strong as God intended,\nand your life will be shortened.If some one was sewing for you, you would not think of shutting her up\nin a little place where she could not move her hands freely.The lungs\nare breathing for you, and need room enough to do their work.The lungs breathe out the waste matter that they have taken from the\nblood.If we should close all the\ndoors and windows, and the fireplace or opening into the chimney, and\nleave not even a crack by which the fresh air could come in, we would\ndie simply from staying in such a room.The lungs could not do their\nwork for the blood, and the blood could not do its work for the body.If your head\naches, and you feel dull and sleepy from being in a close room, a run in\nthe fresh air will make you feel better.The good, pure air makes your blood pure; and the blood then flows\nquickly through your whole body and refreshes every part.We must be careful not to stay in close rooms in the day-time, nor sleep\nin close rooms at night.We must not keep out the fresh air that our\nbodies so much need.It is better to breathe through the nose than through the mouth.You can\nsoon learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth shut when walking or\nrunning.If you keep the mouth shut and breathe through the nose, the little\nhairs on the inside of the nose will catch the dust or other impurities\nthat are floating in the air, and so save their going to the lungs.You\nwill get out of breath less quickly when running if you keep your mouth\nshut.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku\nlar) walls.Every time we breathe, these walls have to move.The muscles\nof the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you\nbreathe.All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is\ndirected by the nerves.You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so\nyou are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs.Besides carrying food all over the body, what\n          other work does the blood do?Why does the blood in the veins look blue?Where is the blood made pure and red again?What must the lungs have in order to do this\n          work?How does the air in a room become spoiled?Why is it better to breathe through the nose\n          than through the mouth?[Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste\nmatter all the time--it is the skin.It is also lined with a more delicate\nkind of skin.You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin\nmeet at your lips.There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without\nhurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so.Because under the\noutside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it\nwill feel the least touch as pain.When the outer skin, which protects\nit, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm.In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the\nface, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of\nwater.We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n).[Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._]\n\nWhere does it come from?It comes through many tiny holes in the skin,\ncalled pores (p[=o]rz).Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is\ncarrying off waste matter and water from your body.If you could piece\ntogether all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one\nperson, they would make a line more than three miles long.Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough\nof it to form drops.But it is always coming out through your skin, both\nin winter and summer.Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out\nmatter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers\nfrom getting hurt.These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would\nbe badly off without such shields.No one likes to see nails that have\nbeen bitten.Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes\nin the skin.This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little\nopenings of the tubes.It should be washed off with soap and water.When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty\nhands and faces.Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed.But\neven if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched\nany thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter\nthat comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or\ndust of the street.You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out\nvery little at a time.Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and\nhealthy, and able to do its work.If the skin could not do its work, you\nwould die.Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time.Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get\nclogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may\nache.No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the\nrest of the body.But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when\nthe ground is wet.When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of\nyour body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a\nlittle shutting up.But as soon as you come into the house, take the\nrubbers off.Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will\nunderstand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little\nworn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration.When these clothes\nare taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will\nair well before morning.Never wear any of the clothes through the\nnight, that you have worn during the day.Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your\npillow.Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where\nthe air can reach it all day.By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep\nat night.You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before\nleaving your rooms in the morning.In this way, the bed and bed-clothes\nmay have a good airing.Be sure to give them time enough for this.You have now learned about four important kinds of work:--\n\n1st.The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take.The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of\nthe body, and to take away worn-out matter.The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and\npure again.The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration\ntubes.All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about\nit at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep\nthem faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.What is the common name\n          for it?How does the perspiration help to keep you\n          well?Why should you not wear rubber boots or\n          overshoes in the house?Why should you change under-clothing night and\n          morning?Where should the night-dress be placed in the\n          morning?What should be done with the bed-clothes?Name the four kinds of work about which you\n          have learned.How are the organs of the body kept at work?[Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around\nus.We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.You already know something about them, for you are using them all the\ntime.In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil.This\npupil is only a hole with a muscle around it.When you are in the light,\nthe muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all\nthe light you need through a small opening.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.When you are in the dark,\nthe muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark.They want all\nthe light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.[Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]\n\nThe pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of\nsight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not\nbear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing\nwe see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that\nthe nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While\nwriting, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;\nthen the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good\ncare of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the\npupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light\nis too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: \"Let us see\nwhich of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time.\"Then they foolishly began to look at the sun.The delicate nerves of\nsight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as\npossible and the eyelid curtains put down.They were trying to see which would bear\nit the longest.Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of\nboth these boys.The one who looked longest at the sun died in\nconsequence of his foolish act.The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to\nimitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed.He turned them; but he could\nnot turn them back again.Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty\nyears old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors\nhave never been able to set them quite right.You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your\neyes too much light.But you must also be sure to give them light\nenough.When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:\n\"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark.\"If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in\nplace of them, and you would never be able to see again.What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to\ncatch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears.These are deeper\nin the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account\nof each sound to the brain.The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye.Careless children\nsometimes put pins into their ears and so break the \"drum.\"That is a\nvery bad thing to do.Use only a soft towel in washing your ears.You\nshould never put any thing hard or sharp into them.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small\nboy.One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the\ndoor, to feel the wind blow into it.He was so young that he did not\nknow it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache.He thought\nit began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that\ndoor.ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,\nis nerve work.The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,\ntaste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought.His hands tremble, his\nspeech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor\nnerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and\nhearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?Where should the light be for reading or\n          studying?Tell the story of the boys who looked at the\n          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself\n          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill\n          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by\n          drinking liquor?\"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm,\" says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm\nvery quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make\nhis blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,\nhe puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your\ntongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out\nof doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold\none, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes\nthis heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of\nthe body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the\nwarmer we feel.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why\nchildren are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A\ngreat deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off\nthrough your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a\nroom full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to\nprevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much\nheat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments\nkeep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be\nworn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they\nare not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the\nseason, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and\nhandsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.This will make the hot\nblood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should\nput on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep\nwarm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are\nsometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one\npart fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside\nskin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or\na cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,\nas a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a\nburning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the\nskin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to\ncarry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be\ncolder than before.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating\nalcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to\nthe brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and\nmay freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but\nthey would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter\nday.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them\nwarm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold\nout best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose\nships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by\ndogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus\nmeat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know\nwhy.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say\nthe same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens\ntheir power to resist cold.[Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]\n\nMany of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from\nthe Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many\nmonths.Seven were\nfound alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward.The\nfirst man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a\ndrunkard.Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco.Of the six now\nliving,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble.It had probably\nweakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of\nsuch poor food as they had.Why do you wear thick clothes in cold weather?How can you prove that you are warm inside?How can you warm yourself without going to the\n          fire?How does it cheat you into thinking that you\n          will be warmer for drinking it?What do the people who travel in very cold\n          countries, tell us about the use of alcohol?How did tobacco affect the men who went to the\n          Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?[Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what\nalcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a\ngreat deal of money.Money spent for that which will do no good, but\nonly harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save\na dollar.You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar.What\nwould the beer-drinker do with it?If he takes two mugs of beer a day,\nthe dollar will be used up in ten days.But we ought not to say used,\nbecause that word will make us think it was spent usefully.We will say,\ninstead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost\nmore.If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not\nso often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched.We should not need so\nmany policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now.If no liquor was\ndrunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.Most of you have a little money of your own.Perhaps you earned a part,\nor the whole of it, yourselves.You are planning what to do with it, and\nthat is a very pleasant kind of planning.Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little\nroll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?It would be worse than wasted,\nif, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it.If you\nshould buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could\nsoon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six\nhundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent\nin this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than\nwasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any\ngood to the world by the change?How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for\n          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a\n          dollar bill.How much money is spent for tobacco, yearly, in\n          this country?*       *       *       *       *\n\nTranscriber's Notes:\n\nThis book contains pronunciation codes.These are indicated in the text\nby the following\n\n          breve: [)i]\n          macron: [=i]\n          tilde: [~i]\n          slash through the letter: [\\l]\n\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.As in effect I dare say, That the exact observation of those few\nprecepts I had chosen, gave me such a facility to resolve all the\nquestions whereto these two sciences extend; That in two or three months\nspace which I employed in the examination of them, having begun by the\nmost simple and most generall, and every Truth which I found being a\nrule which afterwards served me to discover others; I did not only\ncompasse divers truths which I had formerly judged most difficult, But\nme thought also that towards the end I could determin even in those\nwhich I was ignorant of, by what means and how farr it was possible to\nresolve them.Wherein perhaps I shall not appear to be very vain if you\nconsider, That there being but one truth of every thing, who ever finds\nit, knows as much of it as one can know; And that for example a child\ninstructed in Arithmatick having made an addition according to his\nrules, may be sure to have found, touching the sum he examined, all what\nthe wit of man could finde out.In a word the method which teacheth to\nfolow a right order, and exactly to enumerate all the circumstances of\nwhat we seek, contains, whatsoever ascertains the rules of Arithmatick.But that which pleas'd me most in this Method was the assurance I had,\nwholly to use my reason, if not perfectly, at least as much as it was in\nmy power; Besides this, I perceived in the practice of it, my minde by\nlittle and little accustom'd it self to conceive its objects more\nclearly and distinctly; and having not subjected it to any particular\nmatter, I promised my self to apply it also as profitable to the\ndifficulties, of other sciences as I had to Algebra: Not that I\ntherefore durst at first undertake to examine all which might present\nthemselves, for that were contrary to the order it prescribes.But\nhaving observ'd that all their principles were to be borrowed from\nPhilosophy, in which I had yet found none that were certain, I thought\nit were needfull for me in the first place to endevor to establish some,\nand that this being the most important thing in the world, wherein\nprecipitation and prevention were the most to be feared, I should not\nundertake to performe it, till I had attain'd to a riper Age then XXIII.Before I had formerly employed a long time in\npreparing my self thereunto, aswel in rooting out of my minde all the\nill opinions I had before that time received, as in getting a stock of\nexperience to serve afterwards for the subject of my reasonings, and in\nexercising my self always in the Method I had prescribed.That I might\nthe more and more confine my self therein.But as it is not enough to pull down the house where we dwell, before we\nbegin to re-edify it, and to make provision of materials and architects,\nor performe that office our selves; nor yet to have carefully laid the\ndesign of it; but we must also have provided our selves of some other\nplace of abode during the time of the rebuilding: So that I might not\nremain irresolute in my actions, while reason would oblige me to be so\nin my judgments, and that I might continue to live the most happily I\ncould, I form'd for my own use in the interim a Moral, which consisted\nbut of three or four Maximes, which I shall communicate unto you.The first was to obey the lawes and customes of my Country, constantly\nadhaering to that Religion wherein by the grace of God I had from mine\ninfancy bin bred.And in all other things behaving my self according to\nthe most moderate opinions and those which were farthest from excesse,\nwhich were commonly received in practice by the most judicious Men,\namongst whom I was to live: For beginning from that very time, to reckon\nmine own for nothing, because I could bring them all to the test, I was\nconfident I could not do better then follow those of the deepest sense;\nand although perhaps there are as understanding men amongst the Persians\nor Chineses as amongst us, yet I thought it was more fit to regulate my\nself by those with whom I was to live, and that I might truly know what\ntheir opinions were, I was rather to observe what they practic'd, then\nwhat they taught.Not only by reason of the corruption of our manners,\nthere are but few who will say, all they beleeve, but also because\ndivers are themselves ignorant of it; for the act of the thought by\nwhich we beleeve a thing, being different from that whereby we know that\nwe believe it, the one often is without the other.And amongst divers\nopinions equally receiv'd, I made choise of the most moderate only, as\nwell because they are always the most fit for practice, and probably the\nbest, all excess being commonly ill; As also that I might less err from\nthe right way, if I should perhaps miss it, then if having chosen one of\nthe extremes, it might prove to be the other, which I should have\nfollowed.And particularly I plac'd amongst extremities, all those\npromises by which we somwhat restrain our liberty.Not that I\ndisapproved the laws, which to cure the inconstancy of weak minds,\npermit us when we have any good design, or else for the preservation of\nCommerce, one that is but indifferent, to make vows or contracts, which\noblige us to persevere in them: But because I saw nothing in the world\nremain always in the same state; and forming own particular, promised my\nself to perfect more and more my judgment, and not to impair it, I\nshould have thought my self guilty of a great fault against right\nunderstanding, if because I then approved any thing, I were also\nafterwards oblig'd to take it for good, when perhaps it ceased to be so,\nor that I had ceased to esteem it so.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.My second Maxime was, To be the most constant and resolute in my actions\nthat I could; and to follow with no less perseverance the most doubtfull\nopinions, when I had once determined them, then if they had been the\nmost certain.Imitating herein Travellers, who having lost their way in\na Forrest, ought not to wander, turning now this way, and then that, and\nless to abide in one place; but stil advance straight forwards, towards\none way, and not to change on slight occasions, although perhaps at\nfirst Chance only mov'd them to determine that choice: For by that\nmeans, if they do not go directly whither they desire, they will at\nleast arrive somewhere where they will probably be better then in the\nmidst of a Forrest.So the actions of this life admitting often of no\ndelay, its a most certain Truth, That when it is not in our power to\ndiscern the truest opinions, we are to follow the most probable: Yea,\nalthough we finde no more probability in the one then in the other, we\nyet ought to determine some way, considering them afterwards no more as\ndoubtful in what they relate to practice; but as most true and certain;\nforasmuch as the reason was so, which made us determine it.And this was\nsufficient for that time to free me from all the remorse and repentance\nwhich useth to perplex the consciences of those weak and staggering\nminds, which inconstantly suffer themselves to passe to the practice of\nthose things as good, which they afterwards judge evill.My third Maxime was, To endevour always rather to conquer my self then\nFortune; and to change my desires, rather then the order of the world:\nand generally to accustome my self to beleeve, That there is nothing\nwholly in our power but our thoughts; so that after we have done our\nbest, touching things which are without us, all whats wanting of success\nin respect of us is absolutely impossible.And this alone seem'd\nsufficient to hinder me from desiring any thing which I could not\nacquire, and so to render me content.For our will naturally moving us\nto desire nothing, but those things which our understanding presents in\nsome manner as possible, certain it is, that if we consider all the good\nwhich is without us, as equally distant from our power, we should have\nno more regret for the want of those which seem due to our births, when\nwithout any fault of ours we shall be deprived of them, then we have in\nwanting the possessions of the Kingdoms of _China_ or _Mexico_.And\nmaking (as we say) vertue of necessity, we should no more desire to be\nin health being sick, or free being in prison, then we now do, to have\nbodies of as incorruptible a matter as diamonds, or wings to fly like\nbirds.But I confess, that a long exercise, and an often reiterated\nmeditation, is necessary to accustom us to look on all things with that\nbyass: And I beleeve, in this principally consists, the secret of those\nPhilosophers who formerly could snatch themselves from the Empire of\nFortune, and in spight of pains and poverty, dispute felicity with their\nGods, for imploying themselves incessantly in considering the bounds\nwhich Nature had prescribed them, they so perfectly perswaded\nthemselves, That nothing was in their power but their thoughts, that,\nthat onely was enough to hinder them from having any affection for other\nthings.And they disposed so absolutely of them, that therein they had\nsome reason to esteem themselves more rich and powerfull, more free and\nhappy then any other men; who wanting this _Philosophy_, though they\nwere never so much favoured by Nature and Fortune, could never dispose\nof all things so well as they desired.Lastly, To conclude these Morals, I thought fit to make a review of mens\nseverall imployments in this life, that I might endeavour to make choice\nof the best, and without prejudice to other mens, I thought I could not\ndo better then to continue in the same wherein I was, that is, to imploy\nall my life in cultivating my Reason, and advancing my self, as far as I\ncould in the knowledge of Truth, following the Method I had prescribed\nmyself.I was sensible of such extreme contentment since I began to use\nthis Method, that I thought none could in this life be capable of any\nmore sweet and innocent: and daily discovering by means thereof, some\nTruths which seemed to me of importance, and commonly such as other men\nwere ignorant of, the satisfaction I thereby received did so possesse my\nminde, as if all things else concern'd me not.Besides, that the three\npreceding Maximes were grounded only on the designe I had, to continue\nthe instruction of my self.For God having given to every one of us a\nlight to discern truth from falsehood, I could not beleeve I ought to\ncontent my self one moment with the opinions of others, unlesse I had\nproposed to my self in due time to imploy my judgment in the examination\nof them.Neither could I have exempted my self from scruple in following\nthem, had I not hoped to lose no occasion of finding out better, if\nthere were any.But to conclude, I could not have bounded my desires, nor have been\ncontent, had I not followed a way, whereby thinking my self assured to\nacquire all the knowledge I could be capable of: I thought I might by\nthe same means attain to all that was truly good, which should ever be\nwithin my power; forasmuch as our Will inclining it self to follow, or\nfly nothing but what our Understanding proposeth good or ill, to judge\nwell is sufficient to do well, and to judge the best we can, to do also\nwhat's best; to wit, to acquire all vertues, and with them all\nacquirable goods: and whosoever is sure of that, he can never fail of\nbeing content.After I had thus confirmed my self with these Maximes, and laid them up\nwith the Articles of Faith, which always had the first place in my\nBelief, I judg'd that I might freely undertake to expell all the rest of\nmy opinions.And forasmuch as I did hope to bring it the better to passe\nby conversing with men, then by staying any longer in my stove, where I\nhad had all these thoughts: before the Winter was fully ended, I\nreturned to my travels", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "In the mean time I rooted\nout of my minde all those errours which formerly had crept in.Not that\nI therein imitated the Scepticks, who doubt onely to the end they may\ndoubt, and affect to be always unresolved: For on the contrary, all my\ndesigne tended onely to fix my self, and to avoid quick-mires and sands,\nthat I might finde rock and clay: which (me thought) succeeded well\nenough; forasmuch as, seeking to discover the falshood or uncertainty of\nthose propositions I examined, (not by weak conjectures, but by clear\nand certain ratiocinations) I met with none so doubtfull, but I thence\ndrew some conclusion certain enough, were it but onely this, That it\ncontained nothing that was certain.And as in pulling down an old house,\ncommonly those materials are reserved which may serve to build a new\none; so in destroying all those my opinions which I judg'd ill grounded,\nI made divers observations, and got severall experiences which served me\nsince to establish more certain ones.And besides I continued to\nexercise my self in the Method I had prescribed.For I was not only carefull to direct all my thoughts in generall\naccording to its rules, but I from time to time reserv'd some houres,\nwhich I particularly employd to practice it in difficulties belonging to\nthe Mathematicks, loosening from all the principles of other Sciences,\nwhich I found not stable enough, as you may see I have done in divers\nexplain'd in my other following discourses.And thus not living in\nappearance otherwise then those who having no other business then to\nlead a sweet and innocent life, study to separate pleasures from vices,\nand use honest recreations to enjoy their ease without wearinesse; I did\nnot forbear to pursue my design, and advance in the knowledg of truth,\nperhaps more, then if I had done nothing but read books or frequent\nlearned men.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.Yet these nine years were vanished, before I had engaged my self in\nthose difficulties which use to be disputed amongst the learned; or\nbegun to seek the grounds of any more certain Philosophy then the\nVulgar: And the example of divers excellent Men who formerly having had\nthe same designe, seem'd not to me to have succeeded therein, made me\nimagine so much difficulty, that I had not perhaps dar'd so quickly to\nhave undertaken it, had I not perceiv'd that some already had given it\nout that I had already accomplished it.I know not whereupon they\ngrounded this opinion, and if I have contributed any thing thereto by my\ndiscourse, it must have been by confessing more ingeniously what I was\nignorant of, then those are wont to do who have a little studyed, and\nperhaps also by comunicating those reasons, I had to doubt of many\nthings which others esteem'd most eminent, rather then that I bragg'd of\nany learning.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.But having integrity enough, not to desire to be taken for\nwhat I was not, I thought that I ought to endeavour by all means to\nrender my self worthy of the reputation which was given me.And 'tis now\neight years since this desire made me resolve to estrange my self from\nall places where I might have any acquaintance, and so retire my self\nhither in a Country where the long continuance of the warre hath\nestablished such orders, that the Armies which are intertain'd there,\nseem to serve onely to make the inhabitants enjoy the fruits of peace\nwith so much the more security; and where amongst the croud of a great\npeople more active and solicitous for their own affaires, then curious\nof other mens, not wanting any of those necessaries which are in the\nmost frequented Towns, I could live as solitary and retired as in the\nmost remote deserts.I Know not whether I ought to entertain you with the first Meditations\nwhich I had there, for they are so Metaphysicall and so little common,\nthat perhaps they will not be relished by all men: And yet that you may\njudge whether the foundations I have laid are firm enough, I find my\nself in a manner oblig'd to discourse them; I had long since observed\nthat as for manners, it was somtimes necessary to follow those opinions\nwhich we know to be very uncertain, as much as if they were indubitable,\nas is beforesaid: But because that then I desired onely to intend the\nsearch of truth, I thought I ought to doe the contrary, and reject as\nabsolutely false all wherein I could imagine the least doubt, to the end\nI might see if afterwards any thing might remain in my belief, not at\nall subject to doubt.Thus because our senses sometimes deceive us, I\nwould suppose that there was nothing which was such as they represented\nit to us.And because there are men who mistake themselves in reasoning,\neven in the most simple matters of Geometry, and make therein\nParalogismes, judging that I was as subject to fail as any other Man, I\nrejected as false all those reasons, which I had before taken for\nDemonstrations.And considering, that the same thoughts which we have\nwaking, may also happen to us sleeping, when as not any one of them is\ntrue.I resolv'd to faign, that all those things which ever entred into\nmy Minde, were no more true, then the illusions of my dreams.But\npresently after I observ'd, that whilst I would think that all was\nfalse, it must necessarily follow, that I who thought it, must be\nsomething.And perceiving that this Truth, _I think_, therefore, _I am_,\nwas so firm and certain, that all the most extravagant suppositions of\nthe Scepticks was not able to shake it, I judg'd that I might receive it\nwithout scruple for the first principle of the Philosophy I sought.Examining carefully afterwards what I was; and seeing that I could\nsuppose that I had no _body_, and that there was no _World_, nor any\n_place_ where I was: but for all this, I could not feign that I _was\nnot_; and that even contrary thereto, thinking to doubt the truth of\nother things, it most evidently and certainly followed, That _I was_:\nwhereas, if I had ceas'd to _think_, although all the rest of what-ever\nI had imagined were true, I had no reason to beleeve that _I had been_.I knew then that I was a substance, whose whole essence or nature is,\nbut to _think_, and who to _be_, hath need of no place, nor depends on\nany materiall thing.So that this _Me_, to wit, my Soul, by which I am\nwhat I am, is wholly distinct from the Body, and more easie to be known\nthen _it_; and although _that_ were not, it would not therefore cease to\nbe what it is.After this I considered in generall what is requisite in a Proposition\nto make it true and certain: for since I had found out one which I knew\nto be so, I thought I ought also to consider wherein that certainty\nconsisted: and having observed, That there is nothing at all in this, _I\nthink_, therefore _I am_, which assures me that I speak the truth,\nexcept this, that I see most cleerly, That _to think_, one must have a\n_being_; I judg'd that I might take for a generall rule, That those\nthings which we conceive cleerly and distinctly, are all true; and that\nthe onely difficulty is punctually to observe what those are which we\ndistinctly conceive.In pursuance whereof, reflecting on what I doubted, and that\nconsequently my _being_ was not perfect; for I clearly perceived, that\nit was a greater perfection to know, then to doubt, I advised in my\nself to seek from whence I had learnt to think on something which was\nmore perfect then I; and I knew evidently that it must be of some nature\nwhich was indeed more perfect.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.As for what concerns the thoughts I had\nof divers other things without my self, as of heaven, earth, light,\nheat, and a thousand more, I was not so much troubled to know whence\nthey came, for that I observed nothing in them which seemed to render\nthem superiour to me; I might beleeve, that if they were true, they were\ndependancies from my nature, as far forth as it had any perfection; and\nif they were not, I made no accompt of them; that is to say, That they\nwere in me, because I had something deficient.But it could not be the\nsame with the _Idea_ of a being more perfect then mine: For to esteem of\nit as of nothing, was a thing manifestly impossible.And because there\nis no lesse repugnancy that the more perfect should succeed from and\ndepend upon the less perfect, then for something to proceed from\nnothing, I could no more hold it from my self: So as it followed, that\nit must have bin put into me by a Nature which was truly more perfect\nthen _I_, and even which had in it all the perfections whereof I could\nhave an _Idea_; to wit, (to explain my self in one word) God.Whereto I\nadded, that since I knew some perfections which I had not, I was not the\nonely _Being_ which had an existence, (I shall, under favour, use here\nfreely the terms of the Schools) but that of necessity there must be\nsome other more perfect whereon I depended, and from whom I had gotten\nall what I had: For had I been alone, and depending upon no other thing,\nso that I had had of my self all that little which I participated of a\nperfect Being, I might have had by the same reason from my self, all the\nremainder which I knew I wanted, and so have been my self infinite,\neternall, immutable, all-knowing, almighty; and lastly, have had all\nthose perfections which I have observed to be in God.For according to\nthe way of reasoning I have now followed, to know the nature of God, as\nfar as mine own was capable of it, I was onely to consider of those\nthings of which I found an _Idea_ in me, whether the possessing of them\nwere a perfection or no; and I was sure, that any of those which had any\nimperfections were not in him, but that all others were.I saw that\ndoubtfulness, inconstancy, sorrow and the like, could not be in him,\nseeing I could my self have wish'd to have been exempted from them.Besides this, I had the _Ideas_ of divers sensible and corporeall\nthings; for although I supposed that I doted, and that all that I saw or\nimagined was false; yet could I not deny but that these _Ideas_ were\ntruly in my thoughts.But because I had most evidently known in my self,\nThat the understanding Nature is distinct from the corporeall,\nconsidering that all composition witnesseth a dependency, and that\ndependency is manifestly a defect, I thence judged that it could not be\na perfection in God to be composed of those two Natures; and that by\nconsequence he was not so composed.But that if there were any Bodies in\nthe world, or els any intelligences, or other Natures which were not\nwholly perfect, their being must depend from his power in such a manner,\nthat they could not subsist one moment without him.Thence I went in search of other Truths; and having proposed _Geometry_\nfor my object, which I conceived as a continued Body, or a space\nindefinitely spred in length, bredth, height or depth, divisible into\ndivers parts, which might take severall figures and bignesses, and be\nmoved and transposed every way.For the Geometricians suppose all this\nin their object.I past through some of their most simple\ndemonstrations; and having observed that this great certaintie, which\nall the world grants them, is founded only on this, that men evidently\nconceived them, following the rule I already mentioned.I observed also\nthat there was nothing at all in them which ascertain'd me of the\nexistence of their object.As for example, I well perceive, that\nsupposing a Triangle, three angles necessarily must be equall to two\nright ones: but yet nevertheless I saw nothing which assured me that\nthere was a Triangle in the world.Whereas returning to examine the\n_Idea_ which I had of a perfect Being, _I_ found its existence comprised\nin it, in the same manner as it was comprised in that of a Triangle,\nwhere the three angles are equall to two right ones; or in that of a\nsphere, where all the parts are equally distant from the center.Or even\nyet more evidently, and that by consequence, it is at least as certain\nthat God, who is that perfect Being, is, or exists, as any demonstration\nin Geometry can be.But that which makes many perswade themselves that there is difficulty\nin knowing it, as also to know what their Soul is, 'tis that they never\nraise their thoughts beyond sensible things, and that they are so\naccustomed to consider nothing but by imagination, which is a particular\nmanner of thinking on materiall things, that whatsoever is not\nimaginable seems to them not intelligible.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.Which is manifest enough from\nthis, that even the Philosophers hold for a Maxime in the Schools, That\nthere is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the sense;\nwhere notwithstanding its certain, that the _Ideas_ of God and of the\nSoul never were.And (me thinks) those who use their imagination to\ncomprehend them, are just as those, who to hear sounds, or smell odours,\nwould make use of their eys; save that there is yet this difference,\nThat the sense of seeing assures us no lesse of the truth of its\nobjects, then those of smelling or hearing do: whereas neither our\nimagination, nor our senses, can ever assure us of any thing, if our\nunderstanding intervenes not.To be short, if there remain any who are not enough perswaded of the\nexistence of God, and of their soul, from the reasons I have produc'd, I\nwould have them know, that all other things, whereof perhaps they think\nthemselves more assured, as to have a body, and that there are Stars,\nand an earth, and the like, are less certain.For although we had such a\nmorall assurance of these things, that without being extravagant we\ncould not doubt of them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.However, unless we be unreasonable when a\nmetaphysicall certainty is in question, we cannot deny but we have cause\nenough not to be wholly confirmed in them, when we consider that in the\nsame manner we may imagine being asleep, we have other bodies, and that\nwe see other Stars, and another earth, though there be no such thing.For how doe we know that those thoughts which we have in our dreams,\nare rather false then the others, seeing often they are no less lively\nand significant, and let the ablest men study it as long as they please,\nI beleeve they can give no sufficient reason to remove this doubt,\nunless they presuppose the existence of God.For first of all, that\nwhich I even now took for a rule, to wit, that those things which were\nmost clearly and distinctly conceived, are all true, is certain, only by\nreason, that God is or exists, and that he is a perfect being, and that\nall which we have comes from him.Whence it follows, that our Idea's or\nnotions, being reall things, and which come from God in all wherein they\nare clear and distinct, cannot therein be but true.So that if we have\nvery often any which contain falshood, they cannot be but of such things\nwhich are somewhat confus'd and obscure, because that therein they\nsignifie nothing to us, that's to say, that they are thus confus'd in us\nonly, because we are not wholly perfect.And it's evident that there is\nno less contrariety that falshood and imperfection should proceed from\nGod, as such, then there is in this, that truth and falshood proceed\nfrom nothing.But if we know not that whatsoever was true and reall in\nus comes from a perfect and infinite being, how clear and distinct\nsoever our Idea's were, we should have no reason to assure us, that they\nhad the perfection to be true.Now after that the knowledge of God, and of the Soul hath rendred us\nthus certain of this rule, it's easie to know; that the extravaganceys\nwhich we imagin in our sleep, ought no way to make us doubt of the truth\nof those thoughts which we have being awake: For if it should happen,\nthat even sleeping we should have a very distinct Idea; as for example,\nA Geometritian should invent some new demonstration, his sleeping would\nnot hinder it to be true.And for the most ordinary error of our\ndreames, which consists in that they represent unto us severall objects\nin the same manner as our exterior senses doe, it matters not though it\ngive us occasion to mistrust the truth of those Ideas, because that they\nmay also often enough cozen us when we doe not sleep; As when to those\nwho have the Jaundies, all they see seems yellow; or, as the Stars or\nother bodies at a distance, appear much less then they are.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.For in fine,\nwhether we sleep or wake, we ought never to suffer our selves to be\nperswaded but by the evidence of our Reason; I say, (which is\nobservable) Of our Reason, and not of our imagination, or of our senses.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.As although we see the Sun most clearly, we are not therefore to judge\nhim to be of the bigness we see him of; and we may well distinctly\nimagine the head of a Lion, set on the body of a Goat, but therefore we\nought not to conclude that there is a _Chimera_ in the world.For reason\ndoth not dictate to us, that what we see or imagine so, is true: But it\ndictates, that all our Idea's or notions ought to have some grounds of\ntruth; For it were not possible, that God who is all perfect, and all\ntruth, should have put them in us without that: And because that our\nreasonings are never so evident, nor so entire while we sleep, as when\nwe wake, although sometimes our imaginations be then as much or more\nlively and express.It also dictates to us, that our thoughts, seeing\nthey cannot be all true by reason that we are not wholly perfect; what\nthey have of truth, ought infallibly to occur in those which we have\nbeing awake, rather then in our dreams.V.\n\n\nI should be glad to pursue this Discourse, and shew you the whole Series\nof the following Truths, which I have drawn from the former: But because\nfor this purpose, it were now necessary for me to treat of severall\nquestions, which are controverted by the learned, with whom I have no\ndesire to imbroil my self, I beleeve it better for me to abstain from\nit; and so in generall onely to discover what they are, that I may leave\nthe wisest to judge whether it were profitable to inform the publick\nmore particularly of them.I alwayes remained constant to my resolution,\nto suppose no other Principle but that which I now made use of, for the\ndemonstration of the Existence of God, and of the Soul; and to receive\nnothing for true, which did not seem to me more clear and more certain\nthen the demonstrations of Geometry had formerly done.And yet I dare\nsay, that I have not onely found out the means to satisfie my self, in a\nshort time, concerning all the principall difficulties which are usually\ntreated in Philosophy.But that also _I_ have observed certain Laws\nwhich God hath so established in Nature, and of which he hath imprinted\nsuch notions in our Souls, that when we shall have made sufficient\nreflections upon them we cannot doubt but that they are exactly observed\nin whatsoever either is, or is done in the World.Then considering the\nconnexion of these Laws, me thinks, I have discovercd divers Truths,\nmore usefull and important then whatever _I_ learn'd before, or ever\nhop'd to learn.But because _I_ have endeavoured to lay open the principall of them in a\nTreatise, which some considerations hinder me from publishing; _I_ can\nno way better make them known, then by relating summarily what it\ncontains.I had a designe to comprehend all what I thought _I_ knew, before _I_\nwould write it, touching the nature of material things.But even as\nPainters, not being able equally well to represent upon a _flat_ all the\nseverall facies of a solid body, chuse the principall of them, which\nthey place towards the light; and shadowing the others, make them appear\nno more then they do to our sight: So, fearing lest _I_ should not bring\ninto this Discourse all which was in my thoughts, _I_ onely undertook to\nset forth at large my conceptions touching the light; and upon that\noccasion to add somewhat of the Sun, and of the fix'd Stars, by reason\nthat it proceeds almost all from thence; of the Heavens, because they\ntransmit it; of the Planets, of the Comets, and of the Earth, because\nthey cause it to reflect; and in particular, of all Bodies which are on\nthe earth, whether for that they are either coloured, or transparent, or\nluminous; and last of all, of Man, because he is the Spectator thereof.As also, in some manner to shadow out all these things, and that _I_\nmight the more freely speak what _I_ judg'd, without being obliged to\nfollow, or to refute the opinions which are received amongst the\nLearned, _I_ resolved to leave all this world here to their disputes,\nand to speak onely of what would happen in a new one, if God now created\nsome where in those imaginary spaces matter enough to compose it, and\nthat he diversly and without order agitated the severall parts of this\nmatter, so as to compose a Chaos of it as confused as the Poets could\nfeign one: and that afterwards he did nothing but lend his ordinary\nconcurrence to Nature, and leave her to work according to the Laws he\nhath established.Thus first of all _I_ described this Matter, and endevoured to\nrepresent it such, that me thinks there is nothing in the world more\nclear, or more intelligible, except what was beforesaid of God, and of\nthe Soul.For even _I_ expresly supposed that there was in it none of\nthose forms and qualities which are disputed in the Schools; nor\ngenerally any thing but that the knowledge thereof was so naturall to\nour understandings, that we could not even feigne to be ignorant of it.Besides, I made known what the Laws of Nature were; and without\ngrounding my reasons on any other principles, but on the infinite\nperfections of God, I did endeavour to demonstrate all those which might\nbe questioned, and to make them appear to be such, that although God had\ncreated divers worlds, there could have been none where they were not\nobserved.Afterwards _I_ shewed how the greater part of the Matter of\nthis _Chaos_ ought, according to those Laws, to dispose and order it\nself in a certain manner, which would make it like our Heavens: And how\nsome of these parts were to compose an Earth, and some Planets and\nCommets, some others a Sun and fix'd Starrs.And here enlarging my self\non the subject of Light, _I_ at length explain'd what that light was,\nwhich was to be in the Sun and Stars; and thence how it travers'd in an\ninstant the immense spaces of the Heavens, and how it reflected it self\nfrom Planets and Commets towards the Earth._I_ added also divers things\ntouching the substance, situation, the motions, and all the several\nqualities of these heavens and these stars: So that _I_ thought _I_ had\nsaid enough to make known, That there is nothing remarkable in those of\nthis world, which ought not, or at least could not appear altogether\nlike to these of that world which _I_ described.Thence _I_ came to speak particularly of the Earth; how, although I had\nexpresly supposed, that God had placed no weight in the Matter whereof\nit was composed; yet all its parts exactly tended towards its center:\nHow that there being water and air upon its superficies, the disposition\nof the Heavens, and of the Starrs, and chiefly of the Moon, ought to\ncause a floud and an ebb, which in all circumstances was like to that\nwhich we observe in our Seas; And besides, a certain course aswel of the\nwater, as of the air, from East to West, as is also observed between the\nTropicks: How the Mountains, the Seas, the Springs and Rivers might\nnaturally be form'd therein, and Metals run in the mines, and Plants\ngrow in the Fields, and generally all bodies be therein engendered which\nare call'd mixt or composed.And amongst other things, because that next the Stars, I know nothing in\nthe world but Fire, which produceth light, I studied to make all clearly\nunderstood which belongs to its nature; how it's made, how it's fed,\nhow sometimes it hath heat onely without light, and sometimes onely\nlight without heat; how it can introduce several colours into several\nbodies, and divers other qualities; how it dissolves some, and hardens\nothers; how it can consume almost all, or convert them into ashes and\nsmoak: and last of all, how of those ashes, by the only violence of its\naction, it forms glass.For this transmutation of ashes into glass,\nseeming to me to be as admirable as any other operation in Nature, I\nparticularly took pleasure to describe it.Yet would I not inferre from all these things, that this World was\ncreated after the manner I had proposed.For it is more probable that\nGod made it such as it was to be, from the beginning.But it's certain,\nand 'tis an opinion commonly received amongst the Divines, That the\naction whereby he now preserveth it, is the same with that by which he\ncreated it.So that, although at the beginning he had given it no other\nform but that of a Chaos (provided, that having established the Laws of\nNature, he had afforded his concurrence to it, to work as it used to do)\nwe may beleeve (without doing wrong to the miracle of the Creation) that\nby that alone all things which are purely material might in time have\nrendred themselves such as we now see them: and their nature is far\neasier to conceive, when by little and little we see them brought forth\nso, then when we consider them quite form'd all at once.From the description of inanimate Bodies and Plants, I pass'd to that of\nAnimals, and particularly to that of Men.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.But because I had not yet\nknowledge enough to speak of them in the same stile as of the others; to\nwit, in demonstrating effects by their causes, and shewing from what\nseeds, and in what manner Nature ought to produce them; I contented my\nself to suppose, That God form'd the body of a Man altogether like one\nof ours; aswel the exteriour figure of its members, as in the interiour\nconformity of its organs; without framing it of other matter then of\nthat which I had described; and without putting in it at the beginning\nany reasonable soul, or any other thing to serve therein for a\nvegetative or sensitive soul; unless he stirr'd up in his heart one of\nthose fires without light which I had already discovered; and that I\nconceiv'd of no other nature but that which heats hay when its housed\nbefore it be dry, or which causes new Wines to boyl when it works upon\nthe grape: For examining the functions which might be consequently in\nthis body, I exactly found all those which may be in us, without our\nthinking of them; and to which our soul (that is to say, that distinct\npart from our bodies, whose nature (as hath been said before) is onely\nto think) consequently doth not contribute, and which are all the same\nwherein we may say unreasonable creatures resemble us.Yet could I not\nfinde any, of those which depending from the thought, are the onely ones\nwhich belong unto us as Men; whereas I found them all afterwards, having\nsupposed that God created a reasonable soul, and that he joyn'd it to\nthis body, after a certain manner which I describ'd.But that you might see how I treated this matter, I shall here present\nyou with the explication of the motion of the heart, and of the\narteries, which being the first and most general (which is observed in\nanimals) we may thereby easily judge what we ought to think of all the\nrest.And that we may have the less difficulty to understand what I\nshall say thereof, I wish those who are not versed in Anatomy, would\ntake the pains, before they read this, to cause the heart of some great\nanimal which hath lungs, to be dissected; for in all of them its very\nlike that of a Man: and that they may have shewn them the two cels or\nconcavities which are there: First that on the right side, whereto two\nlarge conduits answer, to wit, the _vena cava_, which is the principal\nreceptacle of bloud, and as the body of a tree, whereof all the other\nveins of the body are branches; and the arterious vein, which was so\nmis-call'd, because that in effect its an artery, which taking its\n_origine_ from the heart, divides it self after being come forth, into\ndivers branches, which every way spred themselves through the lungs.Then the other which is on the left side, whereunto in the same manner\ntwo pipes answer, which are as large, or larger then the former; to wit,\nthe veinous artery, which was also il named, forasmuch as its nothing\nelse but a vein which comes from the lungs, where its divided into\nseveral branches interlaid with those of the arterious vein, and those\nof that pipe which is called the Whistle, by which the breath enters.And the great artery, which proceeding from the heart, disperseth its\nbranches thorow all the body.I would also that they would carefully\nobserve the eleven little skins, which, as so many little doors, open\nand shut the four openings which are in these two concavities; to wit,\nthree at the entry of the _vena cava_, where they are so disposed, that\nthey can no wayes hinder the bloud which it contains from running into\nthe right concavity of the heart; and yet altogether hinder it from\ncoming out.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Three at the entry of the arterious vein; which being\ndisposed quite contrary, permit only the bloud which is in that\nconcavity to pass to the lungs; but not that which is in the lungs to\nreturn thither.And then two others at the entry of the veinous artery,\nwhich permits the bloud to run to the left concavity of the heart, but\nopposeth its return.And three at the entry of the great artery, which\npermit it to go from the heart, but hinder its return thither.Neither\nneed we seek any other reason for the number of these skins, save only\nthat the opening of the veinous artery, being oval-wise, by reason of\nits situation, may be fitly shut with two; whereas the other, being\nround, may the better be clos'd with three.Besides, I would have them\nconsider, that the great artery and the arterious vein are of a\ncomposition much stronger then the veinous artery or the _vena cava_.And that these two later grow larger before they enter into the heart,\nand make (as it were) two purses, call'd the ears of the heart, which\nare composed of a flesh like it; and that there is always more heat in\nthe heart then in any other part of the body.And in fine, that if any\ndrop of bloud enter into these concavities, this heat is able to make it\npresently swell and dilate it self, as generally all liquors do, when\ndrop by drop we let them fall into a very hot vessel.For after this I need say no more for to unfold the motion of the\nheart, but that when these concavities are not full of bloud,\nnecessarily there runs some from the _vena cava_ into the right, and\nfrom the veinous artery into the left; for that these two vessels are\nalways full of it, and that their openings which are towards the heart\ncannot then be shut: But that assoon as there is thus but two drops of\nbloud entred, one in either of these concavities, these drops, which\ncannot but be very big, by reason that their openings whereby they enter\nare very large, and the vessels whence they come very full of bloud, are\nrarified and dilated because of the heat which they find therein.By\nmeans whereof, causing all the heart to swel, they drive and shut the\nfive little doors which are at the entry of the two vessels whence they\ncome, hindering thereby any more bloud to fall down into the heart, and\ncontinuing more and more to rarifie themselves, they drive and open the\nsix other little doors which are at the entry of the other two vessels\nwhence they issue, causing by that means all the branches of the\narterious vein, and of the great artery, to swel (as it were) at the\nsame time with the heart: which presently after fals, as those arteries\nalso do, by reason that the bloud which is entred therein grows colder,\nand their six little doors shut up again, and those five of the _vena\ncava_, and of the veinous artery open again, and give way to two other\ndrops of bloud, which again swell the heart and the arteries in the same\nmanner as the preceding did.And because the bloud which thus enters\ninto the heart, passeth thorow", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,\nand are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,\nmay not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise\nthem, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily\nfollows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be\nseen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our\nfingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by\nexperience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and\nfigure of its weight and wheels.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not\nexhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the\narteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart\ndischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what\nhath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must\nbe given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who\ntaught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of\nthe arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,\nenters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self\nback towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a\nperpetuall circulation.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary\nexperience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard\nabove the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to\nissue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound.And the contrary\nwould happen, were it bound underneath, between the hand and the\nincision, or bound very hard above.For its manifest, that the band\nindifferently tyed, being able to hinder the bloud which is already in\nthe arm to return towards the heart by the veins; yet it therefore\nhinders not the new from coming always by the arteries, by reason they\nare placed under the veins, and that their skin being thicker, are less\neasie to be press'd, as also that the bloud which comes from the heart,\nseeks more forcibly to passe by them towards the hand, then it doth to\nreturn from thence towards the heart by the veins.And since this bloud\nwhich issues from the arm by the incision made in one of the veins, must\nnecessarily have some passage under the bond, to wit, towards the\nextremities of the arm, whereby it may come thither by the arteries, he\nalso proves very well what he sayes of the course of the bloud through\ncertain little skins, which are so disposed in divers places along the\nveins, which permit it not to pass from the middle towards the\nextremities, but onely to return from the extremities towards the heart.And besides this, experience shews, That all the bloud which is in the\nbody may in a very little time run out by one onely artery's being cut,\nalthough it were even bound very neer the heart, and cut betwixt it and\nthe ligature: So that we could have no reason to imagine that the bloud\nwhich issued thence could come from any other part.But there are divers other things which witness, that the true cause of\nthis motion of the bloud is that which I have related.As first, The\ndifference observed between that which issues out of the veins, and that\nwhich comes out of the arteries, cannot proceed but from its being\nrarified and (as it were) distilled by passing thorow the heart: its\nmore subtil, more lively, and more hot presently after it comes out;\nthat is to say, being in the arteries, then it is a little before it\nenters them, that is to say, in the veins.And if you observe, you will\nfinde, that this difference appears not well but about the heart; and\nnot so much in those places which are farther off.Next, the hardnesse\nof the skin of which the artery vein and the great artery are composed,\nsheweth sufficiently, that the bloud beats against them more forcibly\nthen against the veins.And why should the left concavity of the heart,\nand the great artery be more large and ample then the right concavity,\nand the arterious vein; unless it were that the bloud of the veinous\nartery, having bin but onely in the lungs since its passage thorow the\nheart, is more subtil, and is rarified with more force and ease then the\nbloud which immediately comes from the _vena cava_.And what can the\nPhysicians divine by feeling of the pulse, unlesse they know, that\naccording as the bloud changeth its nature, it may by the heat of the\nheart be rarified to be more or lesse strong, and more or lesse quick\nthen before.And if we examine how this heat is communicated to the\nother members, must we not avow that 'tis by means of the bloud, which\npassing the heart, reheats it self there, and thence disperseth it self\nthorow the whole body: whence it happens, that if you take away the\nbloud from any part, the heat by the same means also is taken a way.And\nalthough the heart were as burning as hot iron, it were not sufficient\nto warm the feet and the hands so often as it doth, did it not continue\nto furnish them with new bloud.Besides, from thence we know also that the true use of respiration is to\nbring fresh air enough to the lungs, to cause that bloud which comes\nfrom the right concavity of the heart, where it was rarified, and (as it\nwere) chang'd into vapours, there to thicken, and convert it self into\nbloud again, before it fall again into the left, without which it would\nnot be fit to serve for the nourishment of the fire which is there.Which is confirm'd, for that its seen, that animals which have no lungs\nhave but one onely concavity in the heart; and that children, who can\nmake no use of them when they are in their mothers bellies, have an\nopening, by which the bloud of the _vena cava_ runs to the left\nconcavity of the heart, and a conduit by which it comes from the\narterious vein into the great artery without passing the lungs.Next, How would the concoction be made in the stomach, unlesse the heart\nsent heat by the arteries, and therewithall some of the most fluid parts\nof the bloud, which help to dissolve the meat receiv'd therein?and is\nnot the act which converts the juice of these meats into bloud easie to\nbe known, if we consider, that it is distill'd by passing and repassing\nthe heart, perhaps more then one or two hundred times a day?And what\nneed we ought else to explain the nutrition and the production of divers\nhumours which are in the body, but to say, that the force wherewith the\nbloud in rarifying it self, passeth from the heart towards the\nextremities or the arteries, causeth some of its parts to stay amongst\nthose of the members where they are, and there take the place of some\nothers, which they drive from thence?And that according to the\nsituation, or the figure, or the smalnesse of the pores which they\nmeet, some arrive sooner in one place then others.In the same manner\nas we may have seen in severall sieves, which being diversly pierc'd,\nserve to sever divers grains one from the other.And briefly, that which\nis most remarkable herein, is the generation of the animal spirits,\nwhich are as a most subtil wind, or rather, as a most pure and lively\nflame, which continually rising in great abundance from the heart to the\nbrain, dischargeth it self thence by the nerves into the muscles, and\ngives motion to all the members; without imagining any other reason\nwhich might cause these parts of the bloud, which being most mov'd, and\nthe most penetrating, are the most fit to form these spirits, tend\nrather towards the brain, then to any other part.Save onely that the\narteries which carry them thither, are those which come from the heart\nin the most direct line of all: And that according to the rules of the\nMechanicks, which are the same with those of Nature, when divers things\ntogether strive to move one way, where there is not room enough for all;\nso those parts of bloud which issue from the left concavity of the heart\ntend towards the brain, the weaker and less agitated are expell'd by the\nstronger, who by that means arrive there alone.I had particularly enough expounded all these things in a Treatise which\nI formerly had design'd to publish: In pursuit whereof, I had therein\nshewed what ought to be the fabrick of the nerves and muscles of an\nhumane body, to cause those animall spirits which were in them, to have\nthe power to move those members.As we see that heads a while after they\nare cut off, yet move of themselves, and bite the ground, although they\nare not then animated.What changes ought to be made in the brain to\ncause waking, sleeping, and dreaming: how light, sounds, smels, tasts,\nheat, and all other qualities of exteriour objects, might imprint\nseverall _Ideas_ by means of the senses.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.How hunger and thirst, and the\nother interiour passions might also send theirs thither.What ought to\nbe taken therein for common sense, where these _Ideas_ are received; for\nmemory which preserves them; and for fancy, which can diversly change\nthem, and form new ones of them; and by the same means, distributing the\nanimal spirits into the muscles, make the members of the body move in so\nmany severall fashions, and as fitly to those objects which present\nthemselves to its senses; and to the interiour passions which are in\nthem, as ours may move themselves without the consent of the Wil.Which\nwil seem nothing strange to those, who knowing how many _Automatas_ or\nmoving Machines the industry of men can make, imploying but very few\npieces, in comparison of the great abundance of bones, muscles, nerves,\narteries, veins, and all the other parts which are in the body of every\nAnimal, will consider this body as a fabrick, which having been made by\nthe hands of God, is incomparably better ordered, and hath more\nadmirable motions in it then any of those which can be invented by men.And herein I particularly insisted, to make it appear, that if there\nwere such Machines which had organs, and the exteriour figure of an Ape,\nor of any other unreasonable creature, we should finde no means of\nknowing them not to be altogether of the same nature as those Animals:\nwhereas, if there were any which resembled our bodies, and imitated our\nactions as much as morally it were possible, we should always have two\nmost certain ways to know, that for all that they were not reall men:\nThe first of which is, that they could never have the use of speech, nor\nof other signes in framing it, as we have, to declare our thoughts to\nothers: for we may well conceive, that a Machine may be so made, that it\nmay utter words, and even some proper to the corporal actions, which\nmay cause some change in its organs; as if we touch it in some part, and\nit should ask what we would say; or so as it might cry out that one\nhurts it, and the like: but not that they can diversifie them to answer\nsensibly to all what shall be spoken in its presence, as the dullest men\nmay do.And the second is, That although they did divers things aswel,\nor perhaps better, then any of us, they must infallibly fail in some\nothers, whereby we might discover that they act not with knowledge, but\nonely by the disposition of their organs: for whereas Reason is an\nuniversal instrument which may serve in all kinde of encounters, these\norgans have need of some particular disposition for every particular\naction: whence it is, that its morally impossible for one Machine to\nhave severall organs enough to make it move in all the occurrences of\nthis life, in the same manner as our Reason makes us move.Now by these\ntwo means we may also know the difference which is between Men and\nBeasts: For 'tis a very remarkable thing, that there are no men so dull\nand so stupid, without excepting those who are out of their wits, but\nare capable to rank severall words together, and of them to compose a\nDiscourse, by which they make known their thoughts: and that on the\ncontrary, there is no other creature, how perfect or happily soever\nbrought forth, which can do the like.The which happens, not because\nthey want organs; for we know, that Pyes and Parrots can utter words\neven as we can, and yet cannot speak like us; that is to say, with\nevidence that they think what they say.Whereas Men, being born deaf and\ndumb, and deprived of those organs which seem to make others speak, as\nmuch or more then beasts, usually invent of themselves to be understood\nby those, who commonly being with them, have the leisure to learn their\nexpressions.And this not onely witnesseth, that Beasts have lesse\nreason than men, but that they have none at all.For we see there needs\nnot much to learn to speak: and forasmuch as we observe inequality\namongst Beasts of the same kind, aswell as amongst men, and that some\nare more easily managed then others; 'tis not to be believed, but that\nan Ape or a Parrot which were the most perfect of its kinde, should\ntherein equall the most stupid child, or at least a child of a\ndistracted brain, if their souls were not of a nature wholly different\nfrom ours.And we ought not to confound words with naturall motions,\nwhich witness passions, and may be imitated by Machines aswell as by\nAnimals; nor think (as some of the Ancients) that beasts speak, although\nwe do not understand their language: for if it were true, since they\nhave divers organs which relate to ours, they could aswell make\nthemselves understood by us, as by their like.Its likewise very\nremarkable that although there are divers creatures which express more\nindustry then we in some one of their actions; yet we may well perceive,\nthat the same shew none at all in many others: So that what they do\nbetter then we, proves not at all that they have reason; for by that\nreckoning they would have more then any of us, and would do better in\nall other things; but rather, that they have none at all, and that its\nNature onely which works in them according to the disposition of their\norgans.As wee see a Clock, which is onely composed of wheels and\nsprings, can reckon the hours, and measure the times more exactly then\nwe can with all our prudence.After this I had described the reasonable Soul, and made it appear, that\nit could no way be drawn from the power of the Matter, as other things\nwhereof I had spoken; but that it ought to have been expresly created:\nAnd how it suffiseth not for it to be lodg'd in our humane body as a\nPilot in his ship, to move its members onely; but also that its\nnecessary it be joyned and united more strongly therewith to have\nthoughts and appetites like ours, and so make a reall man.I have here dilated my self a little on the subject of the Soul, by\nreason 'tis of most importance; for, next the errour of those who deny\nGod, which I think I have already sufficiently confuted, there is none\nwhich sooner estrangeth feeble minds from the right way of vertue, then\nto imagine that the soul of beasts is of the same nature as ours, and\nthat consequently we have nothing to fear nor hope after this life, no\nmore then flies or ants.Whereas, when we know how different they are,\nwe comprehend much better the reasons which prove that ours is of a\nnature wholly independing from the body, and consequently that it is not\nsubject to die with it.And that when we see no other cause which\ndestroys it, we are naturally thence moved to judge that it's immortall.Its now three years since I ended the Treatise which contains all these\nthings, and that I began to review it, to send it afterwards to the\nPresse, when I understood, that persons to whom I submit, and whose\nauthority can no lesse command my actions, then my own Reason doth my\nthoughts, had disapproved an opinion in Physicks, published a little\nbefore by another; of which I will not say that I was, but that indeed I\nhad observed nothing therein, before their censure, which I could have\nimagined prejudiciall either to Religion or the State; or consequently,\nwhich might have hindred me from writing the same, had my Reason\nperswaded mee thereto.And this made me fear, lest in the same manner\nthere might be found some one amongst mine, in which I might have been\nmistaken; notwithstanding the great care I always had to admit no new\nones into my belief, of which I had not most certain demonstrations; and\nnot to write such as might turn to the disadvantage of any body.Which\nwas sufficient to oblige me to change my resolution of publishing them.For although the reasons for which I had first of all taken it, were\nvery strong; yet my inclination, which alwayes made me hate the trade of\nBook-making, presently found me out others enough to excuse my self from\nit.And these reasons on the one and other side are such, that I am not\nonly somewhat concern'd to speak them; but happily the Publick also to\nknow them.I never did much esteem those things which proceeded from mine own\nbrain; and so long as I have gathered no other fruits from the Method I\nuse, but onely that I have satisfied my self in some difficulties which\nbelong to speculative Sciences, or at least endeavoured to regulate my\nManners by the reasons it taught me, I thought my self not obliged to\nwrite any thing of them.For, as for what concerns Manners, every one\nabounds so much in his own sense, That we may finde as many Reformers as\nheads, were it permitted to others, besides those whom God hath\nestablished as Soveraigns over his people, or at least, to whom he hath\ndispensed grace and zeal enough to be Prophets, to undertake the change\nof any thing therein.And although my Speculations did very much please\nme, I did beleeve that other men also had some, which perhaps pleas'd\nthem more.But as soon as I had acquired some generall notions touching\nnaturall Philosophy, and beginning to prove them in divers particular\ndifficulties, I observed how far they might lead a man, and how far\ndifferent they were from the principles which to this day are in use; I\njudg'd, that I could not keep them hid without highly sinning against\nthe Law, which obligeth us to procure, as much as in us lies, the\ngeneral good of all men.For they made it appear to me, that it was\npossible to attain to points of knowledge, which may be very profitable\nfor this life: and that in stead of this speculative Philosophy which is\ntaught in the Schools, we might finde out a practicall one, by which\nknowing the force and workings of Fire, Water, Air, of the Starrs, of\nthe Heavens, and of all other Bodies which environ us, distinctly, as we\nknow the several trades of our Handicrafts, we might in the same manner\nemploy them to all uses to which they are fit, and so become masters and\npossessours of Nature.Which is not onely to be desired for the\ninvention of very many expedients of Arts, which without trouble might\nmake us enjoy the fruits of the earth, and all the conveniences which\nare to be found therein: But chiefly also for the preservation of\nhealth, which (without doubt) is the first good, and the foundation of\nall other good things in this life.For even the minde depends so much\non the temper and disposition of the organs of the body, that if it be\npossible to finde any way of making men in the generall wiser, and more\nable then formerly they were, I beleeve it ought to be sought in\nPhysick.True it is, that which is now in use contains but few things,\nwhose benefit is very remarkable: But (without any designe of slighting\nof it) I assure my self, there is none, even of their own profession,\nbut will consent, that whatsoever is known therein, is almost nothing in\ncompanion of what remains to be known.And that we might be freed from\nvery many diseases, aswell of the body as of the mind, and even also\nperhaps from the weaknesses of old age, had we but knowledge enough of\ntheir Causes, and of all the Remedies wherewith Nature hath furnished\nus.Now having a designe to employ all my life in the enquiry of so\nnecessary a Science; and having found a way, the following of which me\nthinks might infallibly lead us to it, unless we be hindred by the\nshortness of life, or by defect of experiments.I judg'd that there was\nno better Remedie against those two impediments, but faithfully to\ncommunicate to the publique, all that little I should discover, and to\ninvite all good Wits to endevour to advance farther in contributing\nevery one, according to his inclination and power, to those Experiments\nwhich are to be made, and communicating also to the publique all the\nthings they should learn; so that the last, beginning where the\nprecedent ended, and so joyning the lives and labors of many in one, we\nmight all together advance further then any particular Man could do.I also observ'd touching Experiments, that they are still so much the\nmore necessary, as we are more advanc'd in knowledg.For in the\nbeginning it's better to use those only which of themselves are\npresented to our senses, and which we cannot be ignorant of, if we do\nbut make the least reflections upon them, then to seek out the rarest\nand most studied ones.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.The reason whereof is, that those which are\nrarest, doe often deceive, when we seldome know the same of the most\ncommon ones, and that the circumstances on which they depend, are, as it\nwere, always so particular, and so small, that it's very uneasie to\nfinde them out.First, I\nendevoured to finde in generall the Principles or first Causes of\nwhatsoever is or may be in the world, without considering any thing for\nthis end, but God alone who created it, or drawing them elsewhere, then\nfrom certain seeds of Truth which naturally are in our souls.After\nthis, I examined what were the first and most ordinary Effects which\nmight be deduced from these Causes: And me thinks that thereby I found\nout Heavens, Starrs, an Earth; and even on the Earth, Water, Air and\nFire, Minerals, and some other such like things, which are the most\ncommon, and the most simple of all, and consequently the most easie to\nbe understood.Afterwards, when I would descend to those which were more\nparticular, there were so many severall ones presented themselves to me,\nthat I did beleeve it impossible for a humane understanding to\ndistinguish the forms and species of Bodies which are on the earth, from\nan infinite number of others which might be there, had it been the will\nof God so to place them: Nor by consequence to apply them to our use,\nunless we set the Effects before the Causes, and make use of divers\nparticular experiments; In relation to which, revolving in my minde all\nthose objects which ever were presented to my senses, I dare boldly say,\nI observed nothing which I could not fitly enough explain by the\nprinciples I had found.But I must also confesse that the power of\nNature is so ample and vast, and these principles are so simple and\ngenerall, that I can observe almost no particular Effect, but that I\npresently know it might be deduced from thence in many severall ways:\nand that commonly my greatest difficulty is to finde in which of these\nways it depends thereon; for I know no other expedient for that, but\nagain to seek some experiments, which may be such, that their event may\nnot be the same, if it be in one of those ways which is to be exprest,\nas if it were in another.In fine, I am gotten so far, That (me thinks)\nI see well enough what course we ought to hold to make the most part of\nthose experiments which may tend to this effect.But I also see they\nare such, and of so great a number, that neither my hands nor my estate\n(though I had a thousand times more then I have) could ever suffice for\nall.So that according as I shall hereafter have conveniency to make\nmore or fewer of them, I shall also advance more or lesse in the\nknowledge of Nature, which I hop'd I should make known by the Treatise\nwhich I had written; and therein so clearly shew the benefit which the\nPublick may receive thereby, that I should oblige all those in general\nwho desire the good of Mankinde; that is to say, all those who are\nindeed vertuous, (and not so seemingly, or by opinion only) aswell to\ncommunicate such experiments as they have already made, as to help me in\nthe enquiry of those which are to be made.But since that time, other reasons have made me alter my opinion, and\nthink that I truly ought to continue to write of all those things which\nI judg'd of any importance, according as I should discover the truth of\nthem, and take the same care, as if I were to print them; as well that I\nmight have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as\nwithout doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the\npublick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and\noftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first\nconceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing\nthem to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the\nPublick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,\nthose to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what\nuse of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published\nduring my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto\nperhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it\nwere, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of\nmispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for\nalthough it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in\nhim lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is\nproperly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought\nto reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those\nthings which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are\nalive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more\nadvantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that\nthe little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of\nwhat I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For\nit's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the\ntruth in Learning; as with those who beginning to grow rich, are less\ntroubled to make great purchases, then they were before when they were\npoorer, to make little ones.Or else one may compare them to Generals of\nArmies, whose Forces usually encrease porportionably to their Victories;\nand who have need of more conduct to maintain themselves after the loss\nof a battail, then after the gaining one, to take Towns and Provinces.For to endeavour to overcome all the difficulties and errours which\nhinder us to come to the knowledg of the Truth, is truly to fight\nbattails.And to receive any false opinion touching a generall or\nweighty matter, is as much as to lose one; there is far more dexterity\nrequired to recover our former condition, then to make great progresses\nwhere our Principles are already certain.For my part, if I formerly\nhave discovered some Truths in Learning, as I hope my Discourse will\nmake it appear I have, I may say, they are but the products and\ndependances of five or six principall difficulties which I have\novercome, and which I reckon for so many won Battails on my side.Neither will I forbear to say; That I think, It's only necessary for me\nto win two or three more such, wholly to perfect my design.And that I\nam not so old, but according to the ordinary course of Nature, I may\nhave time enough to effect it.But I beleeve I am so much the more\nobliged to husband the rest of my time, as I have more hopes to employ\nit well; without doubt, I should have divers occasions of impeding it,\nshould I publish the grounds of my Physicks.For although they are\nalmost all so evident, that to beleeve them, it's needfull onely to\nunderstand them; and that there is none whereof I think my self unable\nto give demonstration.Yet because it's impossible that they should\nagree with all the severall opinions of other men, I foresee I should\noften be diverted by the opposition they would occasion.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.It may be objected, These oppositions might be profitable, as well to\nmake me know my faults, as if any thing of mine were good to make others\nby that means come to a better understanding thereof; and as many may\nsee more then one man, beginning from this time to make use of my\ngrounds, they might also help me with their invention.But although I\nknow my self extremely subject to fail, and do never almost trust my\nfirst thoughts; yet the experience I have of the objections which may be\nmade unto me, hinder me from hoping for any profit from them; For I have\noften tried the judgments as well of those whom I esteem'd my friends,\nas of others whom I thought indifferent, and even also of some, whose\nmalignity and envie did sufficiently discover what the affection of my\nfriends might hide.But it seldom happened that any thing was objected\nagainst me, which I had not altogether foreseen, unless it were very\nremote from my Subject: So that I never almost met with any Censurer of\nmy opinions, that seemed unto me either less rigorous, or less equitable\nthen my self.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.Neither did I ever observe, that by the disputations\npracticed in the Schools any Truth which was formerly unknown, was ever\ndiscovered.For whilest every one seeks to overcome, men strive more to\nmaintain probabilities, then to weigh the reasons on both sides; and\nthose who for a long time have been good Advocates, are not therefore\nthe better Judges afterwards.As for the benefit which others may receive from the communication of my\nthoughts, it cannot also be very great, forasmuch as I have not yet\nperfected them, but that it is necessary to add many things thereunto,\nbefore a usefull application can be made of them.And I think I may say\nwithout vanity, That if there be any one capable thereof, it must be my\nself, rather then any other.Not but that there may be divers wits in\nthe world incomparably better then mine; but because men cannot so well\nconceive a thing and make it their own, when they learn it of another,\nas when they invent it themselves: which is so true in this Subject,\nthat although I have often explain'd some of my opinions to very\nunderstanding men, and who, whilest I spake to them, seem'd very\ndistinctly to conceive them; yet when they repeated them, I observ'd,\nthat they chang'd them almost always in such a manner, that I could no\nlonger own them for mine.Upon which occasion, I shall gladly here\ndesire those who come after me, never to beleeve those things which may\nbe delivered to them for mine, when I have not published them my self.And I do not at all wonder at the extravagancies which are attributed to\nall those ancient Philosophers, whose Writings we have not; neither do I\nthereby judge, that their thoughts were very irrationall, seeing they\nwere the best Wits of their time; but onely that they have been ill\nconvey'd to us: as it appears also, that never any of their followers\nsurpass'd them.And I assure my self, that the most passionate of those,\nwho now follow _Aristotle_, would beleeve himself happy, had he but as\nmuch knowledge of Nature as he had, although it were on condition that\nhe never might have more: They are like the ivie, which seeks to climb\nno higher then the trees which support it, and ever after tends\ndownwards again when it hath attain'd to the height thereof: for, me\nthinks also, that such men sink downwards; that is to say, render\nthemselves in some manner lesse knowing, then if they did abstain from\nstudying; who being not content to know all which is intelligibly set\ndown in their Authour, will besides that, finde out the solution of\ndivers difficulties of which he says nothing, and perhaps never thought\nof them: yet their way of Philosophy is very fit for those who have but\nmean capacities: For the obscurity of the distinctions and principles\nwhich they use causeth them to speak of all things as boldly, as if they\nknew them, and maintain all which they say, against the most subtill and\nmost able; so that there is no means left to convince them.\"I don't call the last part funny at all,\" said Minnie, gravely.\"But wasn't it queer for it to think the wig was its mother?\"asked the\nboy, with a merry laugh.\"I don't think it could have had much sense to\ndo that.\"\"But it was only a baby monkey then, Harry.\"Lee, \"", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\"He watched his chance, aunty, and twitched the chain away from Minnie.Now he's done it once, he'll try the game again, I suppose, he is so\nfond of playing us tricks.\"And true enough, the very next morning the lady was surprised at a visit\nfrom the monkey in her chamber, where he made himself very much at home,\npulling open drawers, and turning over the contents, in the hope of\nfinding some confectionery, of which he was extremely fond.\"Really,\" she exclaimed to her husband, \"if Jacko goes on so, I shall\nbe of cook's mind, and not wish to live in the house with him.\"One day, Jacko observed nurse washing out some fine clothes for her\nmistress, and seemed greatly interested in the suds which she made in\nthe progress of her work.Lee's room while the family were at\nbreakfast one morning, and finding some nice toilet soap on the marble\nwashstand, began to rub it on some fine lace lying on the bureau.After\na little exertion, he was delighted to find that he had a bowl full of\nnice, perfumed suds, and was chattering to himself in great glee, when\nAnn came in and spoiled his sport.\"You good for nothing, mischievous creature,\" she cried out, in sudden\nwrath, \"I'll cure you of prowling about the house in this style.\"Giving him a cuff across his head with a shoe, \"Go back to your cage,\nwhere you belong.\"\"Jacko is really getting to be very troublesome,\" remarked the lady to\nher husband.\"I can't tell how much longer my patience with him will\nlast.\"\"Would Minnie mourn very much if she were to lose him?\"\"I suppose she would for a time; but then she has so many pets to take\nup her attention.\"Just then the child ran in, her eyes filled with tears, exclaiming,--\n\n\"Father, does Jacko know any better?\"Because,\" she went on, \"I found him crouched down in his cage, looking\nvery sorry; and nurse says he ought to be ashamed of himself, cutting\nup such ridiculous capers.\"\"I dare say he feels rather guilty,\" remarked Mr.\"He must be\ntaught better, or your mother will be tired of him.\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.When her father had gone to the city, Minnie looked so grave that her\nmother, to comfort her, took the book and read her some stories.A few\nof them I will repeat to you.\"A lady was returning from India, in a ship on board of which there was\na monkey.She was a very mild, gentle creature, and readily learned any\nthing that was taught her.When she went to lie down at night, she made\nup her bed in imitation of her mistress, then got in and wrapped herself\nup neatly with the quilt.Sometimes she would wrap her head with a\nhandkerchief.\"When she did wrong, she would kneel and clasp her hands, seeming\nearnestly to ask to be forgiven.\"\"A gentleman boarding with his wife at a hotel in Paris had a pet\nmonkey, who was very polite.One day his master met him going down\nstairs; and when the gentleman said 'good morning,' the animal took off\nhis cap and made a very polite bow.Upon\nthis the monkey held out a square piece of paper.said the gentleman; 'your mistress' gown is dusty.'\"Jack instantly took a small brush from his master's pocket, raised the\nhem of the lady's dress, cleaned it, and then did the same to his\nmaster's shoes, which were also dusty.\"When they gave him any thing to eat, he did not cram his pouches with\nit, but delicately and tidily devoured it; and when, as frequently\noccurred, strangers gave him money, he always put it in his master's\nhands.\"\"Do you think, mamma, I could teach Jacko to do so?\"\"I can't say, my dear; and indeed I think it would be hardly worth the\npains to spend a great deal of time in teaching him.He seems to learn\nquite fast enough by himself.Indeed, he is so full of tricks, and so\ntroublesome to cook in hiding her kitchen utensils, I am afraid we shall\nhave to put him in close confinement.\"\"I had rather uncle Frank would carry him back to Africa,\" sighed the\nchild.\"Well, dear, I wouldn't grieve about it now.We must manage somehow till\nuncle Frank comes, and then perhaps he can tell us what to do.\"A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome\nthat the servants were constantly complaining.\"\"That seems similar to our case,\" said the lady, smiling, as she\ninterrupted the reading.\"One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into\nthe next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately\nopen.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,\nlaces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away\nvigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be\nfound in the room.\"When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in\nspreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.\"He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to\nhim, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case\nof the large kitchen clock.\"The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his\nplace of refuge when he was in disgrace.\"One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for\ndinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon\nmanaged to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam\nfowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and\nbegan plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the\nservants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in\nsuch a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,\n\"I wonder how old that monkey was.\"\"The book does not mention his age, my dear.\"I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;\nand then I said to myself, 'That one must have been young.'\"\"If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,\"\nremarked the lady.\"His company does not begin to compensate for the\ntrouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and\ntractable.\"\"And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?\"\"I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better\nkind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny\ntricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I\nknew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I\nshould be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; \"O, mamma, I wouldn't\nhave one of my pets killed for any thing.\"Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie's fate, but\nshe wisely said nothing.I don't want to think about such awful\nthings.\"The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently\nshe said, \"Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but\nfirst I must explain to you what a sounding-board is.\"In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the\npulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was\nthought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the\ncongregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my\ngrandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a\nsounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would\nfall on the minister's head and kill him.\"There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept\nin his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,\nwhich was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he\nwent out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out\nof sight, on his way to church.\"But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under\nhis arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the\nopportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,\nran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board.\"Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on\nthe congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle.\"The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much\nenjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the\nsounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was\nunconscious of his presence.\"When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with\nlaughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it\nhis duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action\nof his hands and arms.\"The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every\nmotion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the\ncountenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the\nmost solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity\nappear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,\nevery word being enforced by great energy of action.\"All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with\nardor and exactness.\"The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man\nand his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of\ncomposure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one\nof the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the\nirreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the\nmerriment.\"Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal\nstanding on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his\nmight, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly\nexasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey\nremoved, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to\nrecover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed.\"CHAPTER V.\n\nJACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching\nmice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to\ngood account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,\ndetermined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,\nand shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his\ncomfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every\nthing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and\nwell secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this\ntreatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup\ntureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over\nthe place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke\nshivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup\ntureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he\nbegan to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on\nthe upper shelf.\"There is something good,\" he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,\nraspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,\ndisappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in\na corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave\na scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a\nthousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her\nthat this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,\nwho began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his\nstomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his\nexcess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an\nexperiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new\nmischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,\nlaughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as\nhe said, \"We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;\nbut you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.\"\"Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?\"\"I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I\ncan find any for you.\"He opened the book, and then asked,--\n\n\"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in\ntheir cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the\nanimal look wrinkled?\"\"No, sir; I never heard about it.\"He puts his food in them, and keeps it there\ntill he wishes to devour it.\"There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;\nthat is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,\nand which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The\nfacility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the\nbranches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it\nmakes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,\nit is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it\nto swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.\"\"I'm sure, father,\" eagerly cried Minnie, \"that Jacko has a prehensile\ntail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the\nhay mow.\"But here is an\naccount of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black\nhands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called\nHoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be\none of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to\ndeath; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy\ngreat quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by\nthe natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone\nwould compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us\nthat their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are\nraised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in\nwhich they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A\nhand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum\nin Paris.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.\"Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures\nor hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other\nsubstances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they\ndo not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general\ncry being kept up by the party.\"One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor.\"Mamma,\" she\nexclaimed, \"cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families.\"I suppose, my dear,\" she responded, \"that there is a\ndifference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very\nfond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount\nthem on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection.\"But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,\nand if I can find the book, I will read it to you.\"\"There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most\nbeautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from\nits extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at\nliberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in\norder to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a\nwife.\"For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every\nattention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much\ncruelty.\"One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than\nusual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,\nafter winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and\ndrew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave\nher a push, which threw her into the sea.\"This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he\ndescended in high spirits.\"\"I should think they would have punished him,\" said Minnie, with great\nindignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no\nmeans always to be depended upon.\"Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one\nmore story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,\ncomplied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this\nchapter on Minnie's pet monkey.\"A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented\nto his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it.\"Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress\nused sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him\nrun up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper.\"On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,\nran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and\nchattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,\n'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally\nleaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled\nhimself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth\nopen, his sides ready to burst with his running.\"Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former\nexperience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at\ncleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the\nhandle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he\nrelinquished the sport.\"Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and\nboots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering\nall the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole\nand all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &\nMartin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was\na nice mess for some days after.\"One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found\nSprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and\narranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he\nheard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as\nthough nothing had happened.Occasionally a bowl of water was\ngiven him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his\nfinger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the\nother, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed\nhimself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped\nout and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during\nthis performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his\nmight to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over\nthem.As he was brought from a\nvery warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the\ncold.\"The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his\nbasket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning\nhe frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of\nmaking the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet.\"One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on\nthe tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her.\"Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from\nhis basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it\njust the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving\nonly his head above the water.\"This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water\nbegan to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly\nsat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have\nbeen boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and\nfirmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,\nwho, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head\nand pulled him out.\"He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon\nrecovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot\nexperience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire.\"When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a\nmenagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was\ngreatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty\nquestions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their\nway home, she inquired,--\n\n\"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?\"\"Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot\nconceive of.\"\"I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets,\" added her\nmother, laughing.\"I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,\"\nanswered the child.\"But, father, will you please tell me something\nmore about the curious animals?\"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had\nstopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered\nabout some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to\nget out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,\nand then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in\nthe road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had\ngone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which\nMinnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like\nher.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it\nseemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he\nfound her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave\nJohn orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering\nwhether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy\npaid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature\nmust be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many\nadmonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her\nthoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the\nanimal, which he read to her.\"The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like\nhead, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form\nand position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and\nhands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as\nit is disgusting.\"\"Then follows an account,\" the gentleman went on, \"of the peculiarities\nof different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.\"\"But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.\"I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that\nthey are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper.\"They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the\nseverest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to\ntheir own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions\nare cruel, destructive, and disgusting.\"\"I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples,\" said Minnie; \"but\nhe did not give them any meat all the time I was there.\"\"No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable\nmatter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of\nGood Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to\ndestroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and\ngardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the\ndogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the\ngun.\"As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage\nincreases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible\nfury.\"\"Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking\nencyclopaedia.\"Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless\nthey go into gardens?\"\"I rather think I should soon convince them they\nwere not to enter my garden,\" he said, emphatically.\"But seriously,\nthey descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in\na few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,\nthey move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to\ngive notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,\nthe sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with\nthe greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into\ntheir cheek pouches.\"Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her\nmother said, \"I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named\nKees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.\"Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,\"\nsaid the gentleman, rising.\"It was in a book of travels in Africa,\" the lady went on.\"The\ntraveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his\njourney, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a\nsentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his\nsense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of\nprey, when every thing was apparently secure.\"There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they\ncame across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were\nunacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he\nthrew them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or\ndisagreeable, and left them untasted.\"Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these\nexcursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the\nsport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he\nshowed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance\nabout, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was\nvery fond.\"I recall one amusing trick of Kees,\" said the lady, laughing, \"which\npleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows\nof trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of\nwhich his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he\nwould run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it\nas fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him.\"These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner\nof doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong\nteeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself\ngradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,\nwhile he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,\nwhich gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come\nout.\"Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired\nwith the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the\ndogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew\nweary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into\nservice.As soon as Kees leaped on\nhis back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the\nspot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until\nthe party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great\nhaste to overtake their master.\"Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were\naccustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the\nslightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their\nplaces about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them\ncame too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,\nand thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.\"\"Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed,\" said Minnie,\nwith considerable warmth.\"I have told you the best traits of his character,\" she answered,\nsmiling.\"He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He\ncould not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He\nunderstood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take\nthe cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it\nwhenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these\nmisdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good.\"Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his\nservants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any\nthing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,\ngenerally deserved it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.\"The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the\nplace; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the\nbroken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a\nsevere beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the\ngentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as\nsoon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast.\"One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of\na bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had\ncarefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran\nout of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,\nbut found not a bean left, and Kees missing.\"When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some\nhours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched\nevery where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really\ndeserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a\ndistance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and\nspoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not\ncome down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take\nhim.\"\"No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only\none thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le\nVaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,\npretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that\ntime could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at\na distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;\nand had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the\ninsult.\"*       *       *

but commerce is beginning to crowd in here, and the time is coming\nwhen the French quarter will cease to be an attraction for New Orleans.\"\"Well, we'll get our look at it before it is gone intoirely.\"A few dark figures were moving silently along the streets.The night was\nwarm, and the shutters of the balcony windows were opened to admit air.At a corner they halted, and, of a sudden, Frank clutched the arm of his\ncompanion, whispering:\n\n\"Look--see that man?\"\"Well, I did, and I do not believe I am mistaken in thinking I have seen\nit before.\"\"In the alley where I was trapped by Manuel Mazaro and his gang.\"\"It wur darruk in there, Frankie.\"\"But I fired my revolver, and by the flash I saw a face.\"\"It was the face of the man who just passed beneath this light.\"\"An' pwhat av thot, Frankie?\"\"Pwhat do yez want to see thot spalpane fer?\"\"Why I was attacked, and the object of the attack.\"It sure wur a case av intinded robbery, me b'y.\"He knows all about Rolf\nRaymond and Colonel Vallier.\"\"Rolf Raymond and Colonel Vallier know a great deal about the lost\nFlower Queen.It is possible Mazaro knows something of her.Come on,\nBarney; we'll follow that man.\"\"Jist as ye say, me lad.\"\"Take the other side of the street, and keep him in sight, but do not\nseem to be following him.\"They separated, and both kept in sight of the man, who did not seem to\nfear pursuit or dream any one was shadowing him.He led them straight to an antiquated story and a half Creole cottage,\nshaded by a large willow tree, the branches of which touched the sides\nand swept the round tiles of the roof.The foliage of the old tree half\nconcealed the discolored stucco, which was dropping off in many places.Over the door was a sign which announced that it was a cafe.The door\nwas open, and, in the first room could be seen some men who were eating\nand drinking at a table.The man the boys had followed entered the cottage, passed through the\nfirst room, speaking to the men at the table, and disappeared into the\nroom beyond.\"Are yez goin' to folly him, Frankie, b'y?\"\"There's no tellin' pwhat koind av a nest ye will get inther.\"\"I'll have to take my chances on that.\"\"No, I want you to remain outside, so you will be on hand in case I need\nair.\"\"Av Oi do, you'll see Barney Mulloy comin' loike a cyclone.\"\"I know I may depend on you, and I know this may be a nest of assassins.These Spaniards are hot-blooded fellows, and they make dangerous\nrascals.\"Frank looked at his revolver, to make sure it was in perfect working\norder, dropped it into the side pocket of his coat, and walked boldly\ninto the cottage cafe.The men in the front room stared at him in surprise, but he did not seem\nto give them a glance, walking straight through into the next room.There he saw two Spanish-looking fellows talking in low tones over a\ntable, on which drinks were setting.One of them was the man he had followed.They were surprised to see the boy coolly walk into the room, and\nadvance without hesitation to their table.The one Frank had followed seemed to recognize the lad, and he appeared\nstartled and somewhat alarmed.With the greatest politeness, Frank touched his cap, asking:\n\n\"Senor, do you know Manuel Mazaro?\"The fellow scowled, and hesitated, and then retorted:\n\n\"What if I do?\"At one side of the room was a door, opening on a dark flight of stairs.Through this doorway and up the stairs the fellow disappeared.Frank sat down at the table, feeling the revolver in the side pocket of\nhis coat.The other man did not attempt to make any conversation.In a few minutes the one who had ascended the stairs reappeared.\"Senor Mazaro will soon be down,\" he announced.Then he sat at the table, and resumed conversation with his companion,\nspeaking in Spanish, and not even seeming to hear the \"thank you\" from\nFrank.It was not long before Mazaro appeared, and he came forward without\nhesitation, smiling serenely, as if delighted to see the boy.he cried, \"yo' be not harm in de scrape what we run into?\"\"I was not harmed, no, thanks to you, Mazaro,\" said the boy, coolly.\"It\nis a wonder that I came out with a whole skin.\"\"Senor, you do not blame me fo' dat?I deed not know-a it--I deed not\nknow-a de robbares were there.\"\"Mazaro, you are a very good liar, but it will not work with me.\"The Spaniard showed his teeth, and fell back a step.\"De young senor speak-a ver' plain,\" he said.Mazaro, we may as well understand each other first as\nlast.You are a scoundrel, and you're out for the dollars.Now, it is\npossible you can make more money by serving me than in any other way.If\nyou can help me, I will pay you well.\"Mazaro looked ready to sink a knife into Frank's heart a moment before,\nbut he suddenly thawed.With the utmost politeness, he said:\n\n\"I do not think-a I know what de senor mean.If he speak-a litt'l\nplainer, mebbe I ondarstan'.\"The Spaniard took a seat at the table.\"Now,\" said Frank, quietly, \"order what you wish to drink, and I will\npay for it.I never drink myself, and I never carry much money with me\nnights, but I have enough to pay for your drink.\"\"De senor is ver' kind,\" bowed Manuel, and he ordered a drink, which was\nbrought by a villainous-looking old woman.Frank paid, and, when Mazaro was sipping the liquid, he leaned forward\nand said:\n\n\"Senor Mazaro, you know Rolf Raymond?\"\"I know of her, senor; I see her to-day.\"She has disappeared, and you know what has become of\nher.\"It was a chance shot, but Frank saw it went home.Mazaro changed color, and then he regained his composure.\"Senor,\" he said, smoothly, \"I know-a not what made you t'ink dat.\"\"Wondareful--ver' wondareful,\" purred the Spaniard, in mock admiration.Frank was angry, but he held himself in restraint, appearing cool.Dat show yo' have-a ver' gre't eye, senor.\"\"Why should I do dat when you know-a so much?\"I dare ver' many thing you do not know.\"Mazaro was exasperatingly cool.\"Look here, man,\" said Frank, leaning toward the Spaniard; \"are you\naware that you may get yourself into serious trouble?Are you aware that\nkidnaping is an offense that makes you a criminal of the worst sort, and\nfor which you might be sent up for twenty years, at least?\"\"It is eeze to talk, but dat is not proof,\" he said.exclaimed the boy, his anger getting the better of him\nfor the moment.\"I have a mind to convey my suspicions to the police,\nand then----\"\n\n\"An' den what, senor?you talk ver' bol' fo' boy like you.Well, see; if I snappa my fingare, quick like a flash you\nget a knife 'tween your shouldares.He looked swiftly around, and saw the\nblack eyes of the other two men were fastened upon him, and he knew\nthey were ready to obey Mazaro's signal.\"W'at yo' t'ink-a, senor?\"\"That is very well,\" came calmly from Frank's lips.\"If I were to give\nthe signal my friends would rush in here to my aid.If you stab me, make\nsure the knife goes through my heart with the first stroke, so there\nwill be little chance that I'll cry out.\"\"Den you have-a friends near, ha?Now we undarestan' each odder.\"I have told you that you might find it profitable to serve me.\"\"I want to know who the Queen of Flowers is.\"\"Yes; I want to know where she is, and you can tell me.\"\"Yo' say dat, but yo' can't prove it.I don't say anyt'ing, senor.'Bo't\nhow much yo' pay fo' that info'mation, ha?\"\"Fair price notting; I want good-a price.Yo' don' have-a de mon' enough.\"\"I am a Yankee, from the North, and I will make a\ntrade with you.\"\"All-a right, but I don't admit I know anyt'ing.\"Manuel leaned back in his chair, lazily and deftly rolling a cigarette,\nwhich he lighted.Frank watched this piece of business, thinking of the\nbest manner of approaching the fellow.And then something happened that electrified every one within the cafe.Somewhere above there came the sound of blows, and a crashing,\nsplintering sound, as of breaking wood.Then a shriek ran through the\nbuilding.It was the voice of a female in great terror and distress.Mazaro ground a curse through his white teeth, and leaped to his feet,\nbut Frank was on his feet quite as quickly.Frank's arm had shot out, and his hard fist struck the Spaniard\nunder the ear, sending the fellow flying through the air and up against\nthe wall with terrible force.From the wall Mazaro dropped, limp and\ngroaning, to the floor.Like a flash, the nervy youth flung the table against the downcast\nwretch's companions, making them reel.Then Frank leaped toward the stairs, up which he bounded like a deer.Near the head of the stairs a light shone out through a broken panel in\na door, and on this door Frank knew the blows he had heard must have\nfallen.Within this room the boy fancied he could hear sounds of a desperate\nstruggle.Behind him the desperadoes were rallying, cursing hoarsely, and crying\nto each other.They were coming, and the lad on the stairs knew they\nwould come armed to the teeth.All the chivalry in his nature was aroused.His blood was leaping and\ntingling in his veins, and he felt able to cope with a hundred foes.Straight toward the broken door he leaped, and his hand found the knob,\nbut it refused to yield at his touch.He hurled himself against the door, but it remained firm.There were feet on the stairs; the desperadoes were coming.At that moment he looked into the room through the break in the panel,\nand he saw a girl struggling with all her strength in the hands of a\nman.The man was trying to hold a hand over her mouth to keep her from\ncrying out again, while a torrent of angry Spanish words poured in a\nhissing sound from his bearded lips.As Frank looked the girl tore the fellow's hand from her lips, and her\ncry for help again rang out.The wretch lifted his fist to strike her senseless, but the blow did not\nfall.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.Frank was a remarkably good shot, and his revolver was in his hand.That\nhand was flung upward to the opening in the panel, and he fired into the\nroom.The burst of smoke kept him from seeing the result of the shot, but he\nheard a hoarse roar of pain from the man, and he knew he had not missed.He had fired at the fellow's wrist, and the bullet had shattered it.But now the ruffians who were coming furiously up the stairs demanded\nhis attention.\"Stop where you are, or I shall open fire on you!\"He could see them, and he saw the foremost lift his hand.Then there was\na burst of flame before Frank's eyes, and he staggered backward, feeling\na bullet near his cheek.Not till that moment did he realize what a trap he was in, and how\ndesperate was his situation.The smell of burned powder was in his nostrils, the fire of battle\ngleamed from his eyes.The weapon in Frank's hand spoke again, and once more he found his game,\nfor the leading ruffian, having almost reached the head of the stairs,\nflung up his arms, with a gurgling sound, and toppled backward upon\nthose who were following.Down the stairs they all tumbled, falling in a heap at the bottom, where\nthey struggled, squirmed, and shouted.\"This\nhas turned out to be a real lively night.\"Frank was a lad who never deliberately sought danger for danger's sake,\nbut when his blood was aroused, he entirely forgot to be afraid, and he\nfelt a wild thrill of joy when in the greatest peril.For the time, he had entirely forgotten the existence of Barney Mulloy,\nbut now he remembered that the Irish lad had waited outside the cottage\ncafe.\"He has heard the rumpus,\" said Frank, aloud.\"Whist, be aisy, me lad!\"retorted the familiar voice of the Irish\nyouth.\"Oi'm wid yez to th' ind!\"cried our hero, in great\nastonishment.\"Oi climbed the tray, me b'y.\"\"Th' willey tray as shtands forninst th' corner av th' house, Frankie.\"\"But that does not explain how you came here at my side.\"\"There was a windy open, an' Oi shlipped in by th' windy.\"\"Well, you're a dandy, Barney!\"\"An' ye're a birrud, Frankie.What koind av a muss hiv ye dhropped into\nnow, Oi'd loike ter know?\"I heard a girl shout for help, and I knocked over\ntwo or three chaps, Mazaro included, on my way to her aid.\"\"In here,\" said Frank, pointing through the broken panel.Then Frank obtained a fair look at the girl's face, staggered, clutched\nBarney, and shouted:\n\n\"Look!It is not strange she knew me, for we both know her!<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.While attending school at Fardale Military Academy, Frank had met and\nbecome acquainted with a charming girl by the name of Inza Burrage.They\nhad been very friendly--more than friendly; in a boy and girl way, they\nwere lovers.After leaving Fardale and starting to travel, Frank had written to Inza,\nand she had answered.For a time the correspondence had continued, but,\nat last, Frank had failed to receive any answers to his letters.He\nwrote again and again, but never a line came from Inza, and he finally\ndecided she had grown tired of him, and had taken this method of\ndropping him.Frank was proud and sensitive, and he resolved to forget Inza.This was\nnot easy, but he thought of her as little as possible, and never spoke\nof her to any one.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.And now he had met her in this remarkable manner.Some fellow had\nwritten him from Fardale that Mr.Burrage had moved from the place, but\nno one seemed to know whither he had gone.Frank had not dreamed of\nseeing Inza in New Orleans, but she was the mysterious Queen of Flowers,\nand, for some reason, she was in trouble and peril.Although dazed by his astonishing discovery, the boy quickly recovered,\nand he felt that he could battle with a hundred ruffians in the defense\nof the girl beyond the broken door.Barney Mulloy seemed no less astonished than Frank.At that moment, however, the ruffian whose wrist Frank had broken,\nleaped upon the girl and grasped her with his uninjured arm.\"_Carramba!_\" he snarled.You never git-a\nout with whole skin!\"cried Frank, pointing his revolver at the\nfellow--\"drop her, or I'll put a bullet through your head, instead of\nyour wrist!\"He held the struggling girl before him as a shield.Like a raging lion, Frank tore at the panel.The man with the girl swiftly moved back to a door at the farther side\nof the room.This door he had already unfastened and flung open.\"_Adios!_\" he cried, derisively.\"Some time I square wid you for my\nhand-a!_Adios!_\"\n\n\"Th' spalpanes are comin' up th' shtairs again, Frankie!\"cried Barney,\nin the ear of the desperate boy at the door.Frank did not seem to hear; he was striving to break the stout panel so\nthat he could force his way through the opening.they're coming up th' shtairs!\"\"Oi'm goin' to\nshtop th' gang!\"Out came a long strip,\nwhich Frank flung upon the floor.Barney caught it up and whirled toward the stairs.The desperadoes were coming with a rush--they were well up the stairs.In another moment the leading ruffian would have reached the second\nfloor.\"Get back, ye gossoons!The strip of heavy wood in Barney's hands whirled through the air, and\ncame down with a resounding crack on the head of the leader.The fellows had not learned caution by the fate of the first man to\nclimb the stairs, and they were following their second leader as close\nas possible.Barney had a strong arm, and he struck the fellow with all his power.Well it was for the ruffian that the heavy wood was not very thick, else\nhe would have had a broken head.Back he toppled upon the one behind, and that one made a vain attempt to\nsupport him.The dead weight was too much, and the second fell, again\nsweeping the whole lot to the foot of the stairs.shouted the Irish boy, in wild delight.\"This is th' koind av a\npicnic pwhat Oi admire!It's Barney Mulloy ye're\nrunnin' up against, an' begobs!he's good fer th' whole crowd av yez!\"At the foot of the stairs there was a writhing, wrangling, snarling mass\nof human beings; at the head of the stairs was a young Irishman who\nlaughed and crowed and flourished the cudgel of wood in his hands.Barney, feeling his blood leaping joyously in his veins, felt like\nsinging, and so he began to warble a \"fighting song,\" over and over\ninviting his enemies to come on.In the meantime Frank had made an opening large enough to force his body\nthrough.he cried, attracting the other boy's attention by a\nsharp blow.\"Frankie, ye're muddled, an' Oi nivver saw yez so before.\"\"Nivver a bit would it do for us both to go in there, fer th' craythers\nmoight hiv us in a thrap.\"You stay here and hold the ruffians\nback.Oi hiv an illigant shillaly\nhere, an' thot's all Oi nade, unliss ye have two revolvers.\"\"Thin kape it, me b'y, fer ye'll nade it before ye save the lass, Oi\nthink.\"\"It's nivver a bit Oi worry about thot, Frankie.As soon as he was within the\nroom he ran for the door through which the ruffian had dragged Inza.Frank knew that the fellow might be waiting just beyond the door, knife\nin hand, and he sprang through with his revolver held ready for instant\nuse.There was no light in the room, but the light from the lamp in the\nadjoining room shone in at the doorway.Frank looked around, and, to his dismay, he could see no one.It was not long before he was convinced that the room was empty of any\nliving being save himself.The Spanish ruffian and the unfortunate girl had disappeared.But I did my best, and I followed as soon as possible.\"Then he remembered that he had promised Inza he would save her, and it\nwrung a groan from his lips.he cried, beginning to look for a door that\nled from the room.By this time he was accustomed to the dim light, and he saw a door.In a\ntwinkling he had tried it, but found it was locked or bolted on the\nfarther side.\"The fellow had little time and no hands to lock a door.He must, for this is the only door to the room, save the\none by which I entered.He went out this way, and I will follow!\"Retreating to the farther side of the room, Frank made a run and plunged\nagainst the door.It was bolted on the farther side, and the shock snapped the iron bolt\nas if it had been a pipe stem.Open flew the door, and Frank went reeling through, revolver in\nhand, somewhat dazed, but still determined and fierce as a young tiger.At a glance he saw he was in a small room, with two doors standing\nopen--the one he had just broken down and another.Through this other he\nleaped, and found himself in a long passage, at the farther end of which\nBarney Mulloy was still guarding the head of the stairs, once more\nsinging the wild \"fighting song.\"Not a trace of the ruffian or the kidnaped girl could Frank see.he palpitated, mystified and awe-stricken.That was a question he could not answer for a moment, and then----\n\n\"The window in that room!It must\nbe the one by which the wretch fled with Inza!\"Back into the room he had just left he leaped.Two bounds carried him to\nthe window, against which brushed the branch of the old willow tree.The exultant words came in a panting whisper from his lips as he saw\nsome dark figures on the ground beneath the tree.He was sure he saw a\nfemale form among them, and his ears did not deceive him, for he heard\nat last a smothered appeal for help.Then two other forms rushed out of the shadows and fell upon the men\nbeneath the tree, striking right and left!There was a short, fierce struggle, a woman's shriek, the death groan of\na stricken man, a pistol shot, and scattering forms.Without pausing to measure the distance to the ground, Frank sprang over\nthe window sill and dropped.Like a cat, Frank alighted on his feet, and he was ready for anything\nthe moment he struck the ground.There was no longer any fighting beneath the tree.The struggling mass\nhad melted to two dark figures, one of which was stretched on the\nground, while the other bent over it.Frank sprang forward and caught the kneeling one by the shoulder.Then the boy recovered, again demanding:\n\n\"What has become of Miss Burrage?The colonel looked around in a dazed way, slowly saying:\n\n\"Yes, sah, she was here, fo' Mistah Raymon' heard her voice, and he\nrushed in to save her.\"The colonel motioned toward the silent form on the", "question": "Where is Sandra?

\"but I am truly sorry\nthat the fellow was killed in such a dastardly manner.\"\"So am I, sah,\" confessed the queer colonel.\"He has been ver' valuable\nto me.It will be a long time before I find another like him.\"Frank did not understand that remark then, but he did afterward, when he\nwas told that Colonel Vallier was a professional card sharp, and had\nbled Rolf Raymond for many thousands of dollars.This explained the\nsingular friendship between the sharp old rascal and the young man.More than that, Frank afterward learned that Colonel Vallier was not a\ncommissioned officer, had never been such, but had assumed the title.In many ways the man tried to imitate the Southern gentleman of the old\nschool, but, as he was not a gentleman at heart, he was a sad failure.All at once Frank remembered Barney, and that he had promised to stand\nby the Irish lad.\"Barney Mulloy is in there with that gang of\nraging wolves!\"\"Nivver a bit av it, Frankie,\" chirped a cheerful voice.Down from the tree swung the fighting Irish lad, dropping beside his\ncomrade.\"Th' craythers didn't feel loike comin' up th' shtairs inny more,\"\nBarney explained.\"They seemed to hiv enough sport fer wan avenin'.Somebody shouted somethin' to thim, an' away they wint out doors, so I\ntook to lookin' fer yez, me b'y.\"\"Oi looked out av th' windy, an' hearrud yer voice.Thot's whoy Oi came\ndown.Phat has happened out here, Oi dunno?\"\"Well, it's the avil wan's oun luck!\"\"But av we shtay\nhere, Frankie, it's pinched we'll be by the police as will be afther\ngetting around boy and boy.\"Inza----\"\n\n\"She ain't here inny more, me lad, an' so ye moight as well go.\"Swiftly and silently they slipped away, leaving Colonel Vallier with the\ndead youth.Frank was feeling disgusted and desperate, and he expressed himself\nfreely as they made their way along the streets.\"It is voile luck,\" admitted Barney; \"but we did our bist, an' it's a\njolly good foight we had.Frankie, we make a whole tame, wid a litthle\nyaller dog under th' waggin.\"\"Oh, I can't think of anything but Inza, Inza, Inza!Out of a dark shadow timidly came a female figure.With a cry of joy, Frank sprang forward, and clasped her in his arms,\nlifting her off her feet and covering her face, eyes and mouth with\nkisses, while he cried:\n\n\"Inza, girl!We fought like fiends to save you, and we\nthought we had failed.But now----\"\n\n\"You did your best, Frank, but that dreadful wretch dragged me to the\nwindow and dropped me into the arms of a monster who was waiting below.I made up my mind that I would keep my\nsenses and try to escape.The man jumped after me, and then a signal was\ngiven that brought the others from the building.They were going to wrap\nsomething about my head when I got my mouth free and cried out.There was fighting, and I caught a\nglimpse of the face of Rolf Raymond.I\nfelt myself free, and I ran, ran, ran, till I fell here from exhaustion,\nand here I lay till I heard your voice.cried Barney, \"it's a bit ago we were ravin' at our\nluck: It's givin' thanks we should be this minute.\"Inza is safe, Rolf Raymond\nis dead, and----\"\n\nA cry broke from the lips of the girl.My father and Roderick Raymond, who is a <DW36> and\nhas not many more years to live, were schoolmates and friends in their\nyounger days.Roderick Raymond has made a vast fortune, and in his old\nage he set his heart upon having his son marry the daughter of his\nformer friend and partner.It seems that, when they first got married,\nfather and Raymond declared, in case the child of one was a boy, and\nthat of the other was a girl, that their children should marry.Raymond's only son, as I am an only daughter.Believing himself\nready to die, Roderick Raymond sent to my father and reminded him of\ntheir agreement.As you know, father is not very wealthy, and he is now\nan invalid.His mind is not strong, and he became convinced that it was\nhis duty to see that I married Rolf Raymond.He set his mind on it, and\nall my pleadings were in vain.He brought me here to the South, and I\nsaw Rolf.I disliked him violently the moment my eyes rested on him,\nbut he seemed to fall madly in love with me.He was fiercely jealous of\nme, and watched me as a dog watches its mistress.I could not escape\nhim, and I was becoming entangled deeper and deeper when you appeared.I\nknew you, and I was determined to see you again--to ask you to save me.I took part in the parade to-night, and went to the ballroom.Rolf\nfollowed me about so that I became disgusted and slipped from the room,\nintending to return home alone.Barely had I left the room when a fellow\nwhispered in my ear that he had been sent there by you--that I was to go\nwith him, and he would take me to you.I entered a closed carriage, and\nI was brought to the place where you found me a captive in the hands of\nthose ruffians.\"Frank had listened with eager interest to this explanation, and it made\neverything clear.\"It was ordained by fate that we should find you there,\" he declared.\"It was known the Queen of Flowers had disappeared, and we were\nsearching for you.Rolf Raymond\ncame there, also, and he came to his death.But, Inza, explain one\nthing--why didn't you answer my letters?\"\"I did not; but I received no answers.\"\"Then,\" cried the girl, \"your letters must have been intercepted.I did not know your address, so I could\nnot ask for an explanation.\"\"Well, it has come out right at last.We'll find a carriage and take you\nhome.They reached Canal Street, and found a carriage.Inza's invalid father was astounded when he saw Frank and Barney Mulloy\nappear with his daughter, and he was more than ever astounded and\nagitated when he knew what had happened.But Inza was safe, and Rolf Raymond was dead.It was a lively tale the boys related to Professor Scotch that night.The little man fairly gasped for breath as he listened.In the morning the police had taken hold of the affair, and they were\nhot after the fellows who had killed Rolf Raymond.Frank and Barney were\ncalled on to tell their story, and were placed under surveillance.But the cottage cafe was deserted, and the Spanish rascals were not\ncaptured.They disappeared from New Orleans, and, to this day, the law\nhas never avenged the death of Roderick Raymond's only son.The murder of his boy was too much for Raymond to endure, and he died of\na broken heart on the day of the son's funeral.Knowing he was dying, he\nhad a new will swiftly made, and all his wealth was left to his old\nfriend Burrage.Frank and Barney thoroughly enjoyed the rest of their stay in New\nOrleans.In the open carriage with them, at Frank's side, rode the\n\"Queen of Flowers\" as they went sight-seeing.In the throng of spectators, with two detectives near at hand, they saw\nColonel La Salle Vallier.He lifted his hat and bowed with the utmost\ncourtesy.\"The auld chap is something of a daisy, after all, Frankie,\" laughed\nBarney.\"Oi kinder admire th' spalpane.\"coughed Professor Scotch, at Barney's side.\"He is a great\nduelist--a great duelist, but he quailed before my terrible eye--he was\nforced to apologize.\"If anything happens when we are again separated that you should fail to\nreceive my letters, you will not doubt me, will you?\"And she softly replied:\n\n\"No, Frank, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\"You--you must not forget Elsie Bellwood.\"\"I haven't heard from her in a long time,\" said Frank.But Frank was to hear from his other girl friend soon and in a most\nunexpected manner.From New Orleans Frank, Barney and the professor journeyed to Florida.Frank was anxious to see the Everglades and do some hunting.Our hero was particularly anxious to shoot a golden heron, of which he\nhad heard not a little.One day a start was made in a canoe from a small settlement on the edge\nof the great Dismal Swamp, and on went our three friends deeper and\ndeeper into the wilds.At last the professor grew tired of the sameness of the journey.\"How much further into this wild swamp do you intend to go, Frank?\"\"I am going till I get a shot at a golden heron.\"White hunters have searched the\nremote fastnesses of the Florida swamps for a golden heron, but no such\nbird have they ever found.The Indians are the only ones to see golden\nherons.\"\"If the Indians can see them, white men may find them.I shall not be\nsatisfied till I have shot one.\"\"Oh, I don't know about that, professor.I am something of an Indian\nmyself.You know the Seminoles are honest and peaceable, and----\"\n\n\"All Indians are liars.I would not take the word of a Seminole under\nany condition.Come, Frank, don't be foolish; let's turn round and go\nback.We may get bewildered on these winding waterways which twist here\nand there through swamps of cypress and rushes.We were foolish to come\nwithout a guide, but----\"\n\n\"We could not obtain one until to-morrow, and I wished to come to-day.\"\"Now, you are getting scared, professor,\" laughed Frank, lifting his\npaddle from the water and laying it across the bow of the canoe.\"I'll\ntell you what we'll do.\"\"We'll leave it to Barney, who has not had a word to say on the matter.If he says go back, we'll go back.\"Professor Scotch hesitated, scratched his fingers into his fiery beard,\nand then said:\n\n\"Well, I'll have to do as you boys say, anyway, so we'll leave it to\nBarney.\"\"What do you say, Barney, my\nboy?\"Barney Mulloy was in the stern of the canoe that had been creeping along\none of the sluggish water courses that led through the cypress swamp and\ninto the heart of the Everglades.\"Well, gintlemin,\" he said, \"Oi've been so busy thrying to kape thrack\nav th' twists an' turruns we have been makin' thot Oi didn't moind mutch\npwhat ye wur soaying.So the matter was laid before him, and, when he had heard what Frank and\nthe professor had to say, he declared:\n\n\"Fer mesilf it's nivver a bit do Oi care where we go ur pwhat we do,\nbut, as long as we hiv come so fur, an' Frankie wants to go furder, Oi'd\nsoay go on till he is sick av it an' reddy to turn back.\"\"As I knew it would be settled,\" growled Professor Scotch, sulkily.Well, I suppose I'll have to\nsubmit.\"So the trio pushed on still farther into the great Dismal Swamp, a weird\nsection of strange vegetable and animal life, where great black trees\nstood silent and grim, with Spanish moss dangling from their branches,\nbright-plumaged birds flashed across the opens, ugly snakes glided\nsinuously over the boggy land, and sleepy alligators slid from muddy\nbanks and disappeared beneath the surface of the dead water.\"If we should come upon one of these wonderful golden herons, Frank\ncould not come within a hundred yards of it with that old bow and\narrow,\" he said.\"Perhaps not, but I could make a bluff at\nit.\"\"I don't see why you won't use a gun.\"In the first place, in order to be sure of\nkilling a heron with a shotgun I'd have to use fairly large shot, and\nthat might injure the bird badly; in the second place, there might be\ntwo, and I'd not be able to bag more than one of them with a gun, as the\nreport would scare the other.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Then there is the possibility that I would\nmiss with the first shot, and the heron would escape entirely.If I miss\nwith an arrow, it is not likely the bird will be alarmed and take to\nflight, so I'll have another chance at it.Oh, there are some advantages\nin using the primitive bow and arrow.\"\"You have a way of always making out a good\ncase for yourself.he is a hard b'y to bate, profissor,\" grinned Barney.\"Av he\nwurn't, it's dead he'd been long ago.\"\"That's right, that's right,\" agreed Scotch, who admired Frank more than\nhe wished to acknowledge.\"It's not all luck, profissor,\" assured the Irish boy.\"In minny cases\nit's pure nerve thot pulls him through.\"\"Well, there's a great deal of luck in it--of course there is.\"\"Oh, humor the professor, Barney,\" laughed Frank.\"Perhaps he'll become\nbetter natured if you do.\"They now came to a region of wild cypress woods, where the treetops were\nliterally packed with old nests, made in the peculiar heron style.They\nwere constructed of huge bristling piles of cross-laid sticks, not\nunlike brush heaps of a Western clearing.Here for years, almost ages, different species of herons had built their\nnests in perfect safety.As the canoe slowly and silently glided toward the \"rookeries,\" white\nand blue herons were seen to rise from the reed-grass and fly across the\nopens in a stately manner, with their long necks folded against their\nbreasts, and their legs projecting stiffly behind them.\"Pwoy don't yez be satisfoied wid a few av th' whoite wans, Frankie?\"\"They're handsome,\" admitted Frank; \"but a golden heron is worth a large\nsum as a curiosity, and I mean to have one.\"\"All roight, me b'y; have yer own way, lad.\"\"He'll do that, anyhow,\" mumbled Professor Scotch, gruffly.They could now see long, soldier-like lines of herons stretched out\nalong the reedy swales, standing still and solemn, like pickets on duty.They were not particularly wary or wild, for they had not been hunted\nvery much in the wild region which they inhabited.Little green herons were plentiful, and they kept flying up before the\ncanoe constantly, scaring the others, till Frank grew very impatient,\ndeclaring:\n\n\"Those little rascals will scare away a golden heron, if we are\nfortunate enough to come upon one.\"Let me shoot a few of th' varmints,\" urged Barney, reaching for one of\nthe guns in the bottom of the canoe.\"Think what the report of a gun\nwould do here.muttered the Irish lad, reluctantly relinquishing his hold\non the gun.\"Av ye soay kape still, kape still it is.\"Frank instructed the professor to take in his paddle, and Barney was\ndirected to hold the canoe close to the edge of the rushes.In this\nmanner, with Frank kneeling in the prow, an arrow ready notched on the\nstring, he could shoot with very little delay.Beyond the heron rookery the waterway wound into the depths of a dark,\nforbidding region, where the Spanish moss hung thick, and the great\ntrees leaned over the water.They had glided past one side of the rookery and were near this dark\nopening when an exclamation of surprise came from Frank Merriwell's\nlips.\"Phat is it, me b'y?\"\"There must be other hunters near at hand,\" said the professor.\"The canoe is not drawn up to the bank,\" said Frank, in a puzzled way.\"It seems to be floating at some distance from the shore.\"\"Why should it be moored in such a place?There are no tides here, and\nalligators are not liable to steal canoes.\"\"Do ye see inny soign av a camp, Frankie?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.\"Not a sign of a camp or a human being.A strange feeling of wonder that swiftly changed to awe was creeping\nover them.The canoe was snowy white, and lay perfectly motionless on\nthe still surface of the water.It was in the dark shadow beneath the\ntrees.\"Perhaps the owner of the canoe is lying in the bottom,\" suggested the\nprofessor.\"We'll see about that,\" said Frank, putting down the bow and arrow and\ntaking up a paddle.With the very first stroke in that direction a most astonishing thing\nhappened.The white canoe seemed to swing slightly about, and then, with no\nvisible occupant and no apparent motive power, it glided smoothly and\ngently toward the dark depths of the black forest!Oi fale me hair shtandin' on me head!\"Look at the\nripple that spreads from her prow!\"\"But--but,\" spluttered Professor Scotch, \"what is making her move--what\nis propelling her?\"came from Frank, \"but it's a mystery I mean to\nsolve!We'll run her down and look her over.\"Then a strange race began, canoe against canoe, the one in the lead\napparently empty, the one pursuing containing three persons who were\nusing all their strength and skill to overtake the empty craft.[Illustration: \"The white canoe had stopped, and was lying calmly on the\ninky surface of the shadowed water.\"(See page 147)]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.snorted Barney, in disgust, great drops of perspiration rolling\ndown his face.\"As if we wurn't pullin'!\"it's not our fault at all, at all.\"Indeed, no matter how hard they worked, no matter how fast they made the\ncanoe fly through the water, they could not gain on the mysterious white\ncanoe.The distance between the two canoes seemed to remain just the\nsame, and the one in advance slipped through the water without a sound,\nfollowing the winding water course beneath the dark trees and going\ndeeper and deeper into the heart of the swamp.Other water courses were passed, running away into unknown and\nunexplorable wilds.It grew darker and darker, and the feeling of awe\nand fear fell more heavily upon them.At last, exhausted and discouraged, the professor stopped paddling,\ncrying to his companions, in a husky voice:\n\n\"Stop, boys, stop!There is something supernatural about that fiendish\nboat!It is luring us to some frightful fate!\"\"You are not superstitious--you\nhave said so at least a score of times.\"\"That's all right,\" returned Scotch, shaking his head.\"I do not take\nany stock in rappings, table tippings, and that kind of stuff, but I\nwill confess this is too much for me.\"Oi don't wonder at thot,\" gurgled Barney Mulloy, wiping the\ngreat drops of perspiration from his forehead.\"It's the divvil's own\ncanoe, thot is sure!\"\"Thin ixplain it fer me, me b'y--ixplain it.\"\"Oh, I won't say that I can explain it, for I do not pretend to\nunderstand it; but I'll wager that the mystery would be readily solved\nif we could overtake and examine that canoe.\"\"Mebbe so; but I think it nades a stameboat to overtake it.\"Professor Scotch shook his head in a most solemn manner.\"Boys,\" he said, \"in all my career I have never seen anything like this,\nand I shall never dare tell this adventure, for people in general would\nnot believe it--they'd think I was lying.\"\"And, still I will wager that the\nexplanation of the whole matter would seem very simple if we could\novertake that canoe and examine it.\"\"I am surprised at you, professor--I am more than surprised.\"\"I can't help it if you are, my boy.\"\"I am afraid your mind is beginning to weaken.\"\"Oi loike fun as well as th' nixt wan,\nbut, be jabbers!it's nivver a bit av it can Oi see in this!\"cried the professor, pointing at the mystic\ncraft.\"And seems to be waiting for us to pursue again.\"\"I am not,\" decisively declared Professor Scotch.\"It's enough av this\nkoind av business Oi've been in!\"\"We'll turn about,\" said Scotch, grimly.\"That canoe will lure us into\nthis dismal swamp so far that we'll never find our way out.\"I suppose I'll have to give up, but I do dislike\nto leave without solving the mystery of that canoe.\"\"It may be thot we're so far in thot we can't foind our way out at all,\nat all,\" said the Irish lad.\"I'm afraid we'll not be able to get out before nightfall,\" confessed\nthe professor.\"I have no fancy for spending a night in this swamp.\"Barney promptly expressed his dislike for such an adventure, but Frank\nwas silent.The canoe turned about, and they set about the task of retracing the\nwater courses by which they had come far into the swamp.It was not long before they came to a place where the courses divided.Frank was for following one, while both Barney and the professor\ninsisted that the other was the right way.Finally, Frank gave in to them, although it was against his better\njudgment, and he felt that he should not submit.They had not proceeded far before, as they were passing round a bend, a\ncry of astonishment fell from Barney's lips.Th' thing is afther follying av us!\"They looked back, and, sure enough, there was the mysterious canoe,\ngliding after them, like a most uncanny thing!said Frank, in a tone that plainly indicated he did\nnot like it.throbbed the professor, splashing his paddle into the\nwater and very nearly upsetting them all.\"Don't let the thing overtake\nus!\"Oi think it's a foine plan to be gettin' out av this,\" muttered Barney,\nin an agitated tone of voice.\"Steady, there, professor,\" called Frank, sharply.\"What do you want to\ndo--drown us all?As long as we could not overtake it, let it overtake us.\"Th' skame won't worruck, me b'y.Th' ould thing's shtopped.\"It was true; the white canoe had stopped, and was lying calmly on the\ninky surface of the shadowed water.\"Well, I can't say that I like this,\" said Frank.\"And I scarcely think I like it more than you do,\" came from the\nprofessor.\"An' th' both av yez loike it as well as mesilf,\" put in the Irish\nyouth.Go on they did, but the white canoe still followed, keeping at a\ndistance.\"I can't stand this,\" declared Frank, as he picked up a rifle from the\nbottom of the canoe.\"Pwhat are yez goin' to do, me b'y?\"\"Shoot a few holes in that craft,\" was the deliberate answer.\"Swing to\nthe left, so that I may have a good chance.\"\"No telling what'll come of it if you shoot.\"\"I'll simply put a few holes through that canoe.\"\"It may sind us all to glory by th' farrust express.\"Swing her to the left, I say.I am going to\nshoot, and that settles it.\"It was useless for them to urge him not to fire; he was determined, and\nnothing they could say would change his mind.The canoe drifted round to\nthe left, and the rifle rose to Frank's shoulder.The clear report rang out and echoed through the cypress forest.The bullet tore through the white canoe, and the weird craft seemed to\ngive a leap, like a wounded creature.echoed the professor, quivering with terror.groaned Barney Mulloy, his face white and his eyes staring.\"She is turning about--she is going to leave us!Up the rifle came, but, just as he pressed the trigger, Professor Scotch\npushed the weapon to one side, so the bullet did not pass within twenty\nfeet of the white canoe.\"I couldn't see you shoot into that canoe again,\" faltered the agitated\nprofessor.He could not explain, and he was\nashamed of his agitation and fears.\"Well, you fellows lay over anything I ever went up against!\"\"I didn't suppose you could be so thoroughly\nchildish.\"\"All right, Frank,\" came humbly from the professor's lips.\"I can't help\nit, and I haven't a word to say.\"\"But I will take one more shot at that canoe!\"The mysterious canoe had vanished from view while they were\nspeaking.The exclamations came from Frank and Professor Scotch.Barney's chuckle changed to a shiver, and his teeth chattered.\"Th' Ould B'y's in it!\"\"The Old Boy must have been in that canoe,\" agreed the professor.He still refused to believe there\nwas anything supernatural about the mysterious, white canoe, but he was\nforced to acknowledge to himself that the craft had done most amazing\nthings.\"It simply slipped into some branch waterway while we were not looking,\"\nhe said, speaking calmly, as if it were the most commonplace thing\nimaginable.\"Well, it's gone,\" said Scotch, as if greatly relieved.\"Now, let's get\nout of this in a great hurry.\"\"I am for going back to see what has become of the white canoe,\" said\nFrank, with deliberate intent to make his companions squirm.Barney and the professor raised a perfect howl of protest.shouted Scotch, nearly upsetting the boat in his excitement,\nand wildly flourishing his arms in the air.\"Oi'll joomp overboard an' swim out av\nthis before Oi'll go back!\"\"I suppose I'll have to give in to\nyou, as you are two to one.\"\"Come on,\" fluttered the professor; \"let's be moving.\"So Frank put down the rifle, and picked up his paddle, and they resumed\ntheir effort to get out of the swamp before nightfall.But the afternoon was well advanced, and night was much nearer than they\nhad thought, as they were soon to discover.At last, Barney cried:\n\n\"Oi see loight enough ahead!We must be near out av th' woods.\"For a long time he had been certain they were on the\nwrong course, but he hoped it would bring them out somewhere.He had\nnoted the light that indicated they were soon to reach the termination\nof the cypress swamp, but he held his enthusiasm in check till he could\nbe sure they had come out somewhere near where they had entered the\ndismal region.Do you mean to say that we don't know our business?What if\nwe had accepted your way of getting out of the swamp!We'd been in there\nnow, sir.\"\"Don't crow till you're out of the woods,\" advised Frank.Oi belave he'd be plazed av we didn't get out at all, at all!\"In a short time they came to the termination of the cypress woods, but,\nto the surprise of Barney and the professor, the swamp, overgrown with\ntall rushes and reed-grass, continued, with the water course winding\naway through it.\"Pwhat th' ould boy does this mane?\"\"It means,\" said Frank, coolly, \"that we have reached the Everglades.\"Well, pwhat do we want iv thim, Oi dunno?\"\"They are one of the sights of Florida, Barney.\"\"It's soights enough I've seen alreddy.Oi'd loike ter git out av this.\"\"I knew you wouldn't get out this way, for we have not passed the\nrookeries of the herons, as you must remember.\"\"That's true,\" sighed the professor, dejectedly.\"Turn about, and retrace our steps,\" said Frank.But Barney and the professor raised a vigorous protest.\"Nivver a bit will yez get me inther thot swamp again th' doay!\"shouted\nthe Irish lad, in a most decisive manner.\"If we go back, we'll not be able to get out before darkness comes on,\nand we'll have to spend the night in the swamp,\" said Scotch, excitedly.\"I don't seem\nto have anything to say in this matter.You are running it to suit\nyourselves.\"They were undecided, but one thing was certain; they would not go back\ninto the swamp.The white canoe was there, and the professor and the\nIrish lad did not care to see that again.\"We're out av th' woods, an',\nby follyin' this strame, we ought to get out av th' Iverglades.\"asked Frank, who was rather enjoying the\nadventure, although he did not fancy the idea of spending a night on the\nmarsh.\"Go on--by all means, go on!\"We'll proceed to explore the Everglades in company\nwith Professor Scotch, the noted scientist and daring adventurer.So they pushed onward into the Everglades, while the sun sank lower and\nlower, finally dropping beneath the horizon.Night was coming on, and they were in the heart of the Florida\nEverglades!Barney and the professor fell to growling at each other, and they kept\nit up while Frank smiled and remained silent.At length, Scotch took in his paddle in disgust, groaning:\n\n\"We're lost!\"\"I am inclined to think so myself,\" admitted Frank, cheerfully.\"Well, who's to blame, Oi'd loike to know?\"roared the professor, like a wounded lion.\"It's yersilf thot is to blame!Frankie wanted to go the other woay, but ye said no.\"You\ninsisted that this was the proper course to pursue!\"Profissor, ye're a little oulder thin Oi be, but av ye wur nigh me age,\nOi'd inform ye thot ye didn't know how to spake th' truth.\"\"Do you mean to call me a liar, you impudent young rascal?\"\"Not now, profissor; but I would av ye wur younger.\"\"Well, pwhat are yez goin' to do about it?\"\"I'll make you swallow the words, you scoundrel!\"\"Well, thot would be more av a male thin the rist av ye are loikely to\nget th' noight, so it is!\"\"Come, come,\" laughed Frank; \"this is no time nor place to quarrel.\"\"You're right, Frank; but this ungrateful young villain makes me very\ntired!\"\"Excuse me, but you know human beings are influenced by their\nsurroundings and associates.\"You would not accuse me of\nhaving taught you to use slang?\"No, no--that is, you see--er--well, er, that Dutch boy\nwas always saying something slangy.\"Quite a joke--quite a little joke, you\nknow!As under the circumstances there was nothing else to do, they finally\npaddled slowly forward, looking for a piece of dry land, where they\ncould stop and camp for the night.They approached a small cluster of trees, which rose above the rushes,\nand it was seen that they seemed to be growing on land that was fairly\nhigh and dry.\"It's not likely we'll find another\nplace like that anywhere in the Everglades.\"As they came nearer, they saw the trees seemed to be growing on an\nisland, for the water course divided and ran on either side of them.\"This is really a\nvery interesting and amusing adventure.\"\"It may be for you,\" groaned the professor; \"but you forget that it is\nsaid to be possible for persons to lose themselves in the Everglades and\nnever find their way out.\"\"On the contrary, I remember it quite well.In fact, it is said that,\nwithout a guide, the chances of finding a way out of the Everglades is\nsmall, indeed.\"\"Well, what do you feel so exuberant about?\"\"Why, the possibility that we'll all perish in the Everglades adds zest\nto this adventure--makes it really interesting.\"\"Frank, you're a puzzle to me.You are cautious about running into\ndanger of any sort, but, once in it, you seem to take a strange and\nunaccountable delight in the peril.The greater the danger, the happier\nyou seem to feel.\"\"Thot's roight,\" nodded Barney.\"When I am not in danger, my good judgment tells me to take no chances;\nbut when I get into it fairly, I know the only thing to be done is to\nmake the best of it.I delight in adventure--I was born for it!\"A dismal sound came from the professor's throat.\"When your uncle died,\" said Scotch, \"I thought him my friend.Although\nwe had quarreled, I fancied the hatchet was buried.He made me your\nguardian, and I still believed he had died with nothing but friendly\nfeelings toward me.But he knew you, and now I believe it was an act of\nmalice toward me when he made me your guardian.And, to add to my\nsufferings, he decreed that I should travel with you.Asher Dow\nMerriwell deliberately plotted against my life!He knew the sort of a\ncareer you would lead me, and he died chuckling in contemplation of the\nmisery and suffering you would inflict upon me!That man was a\nmonster--an inhuman wretch!\"cried Barney, pointing toward the small, timbered island.\"May Ould Nick floy away wid me av it ain't a house!\"In a little", "question": "Where is Daniel?

It was a living crucifixion.... I nearly\nburst with the trammels.... A L100,000 a year would not have kept me\nthere.I resigned on 2 June, and never unpacked my official dress.\"The immediate consequence referred to was as follows: In the drawer of\nMr J. D. Campbell, at the office at Storey's Gate of the Chinese\nImperial Customs, had been lying for some little time the\nfollowing telegram for Colonel Gordon from Sir Robert Hart, the\nInspector-General of the Department in China:--\n\n     \"I am directed to invite you here (Peking).The opportunity of doing really useful work on a\n     large scale ought not to be lost.Work, position, conditions, can\n     all be arranged with yourself here to your satisfaction.Do take\n     six months' leave and come.\"As Mr Campbell was aware of Gordon's absence in India, he had thought\nit useless to forward the message, and it was not until the\nresignation was announced that he did so.In dealing with this\nintricate matter, which was complicated by extraneous considerations,\nit is necessary to clear up point by point.When Gordon received the\nmessage he at once concluded that the invitation came from his old\ncolleague Li Hung Chang, and accepted it on that assumption, which in\nthe end proved erroneous.It is desirable to state that since Gordon's\ndeparture from China in 1865 at least one communication had passed\nbetween these former associates in a great enterprise.The following\ncharacteristic letter, dated Tientsin, 22nd March 1879, reached Gordon\nwhile he was at Khartoum:--\n\n     \"DEAR SIR,--I am instructed by His Excellency the Grand\n     Secretary, Li, to answer your esteemed favour, dated the 27th\n     October 1878, from Khartoum, which was duly received.I am right\n     glad to hear from you.It is now over fourteen years since we\n     parted from each other.Although I have not written to you, but I\n     often speak of you, and remember you with very great interest.The benefit you have conferred on China does not disappear with\n     your person, but is felt throughout the regions in which you\n     played so important and active a part.All those people bless you\n     for the blessings of peace and prosperity which they now enjoy.\"Your achievements in Egypt are well known throughout the\n     civilized world.I see often in the papers of your noble works on\n     the Upper Nile.You are a man of ample resources, with which you\n     suit yourself to any kind of emergency.My hope is that you may\n     long be spared to improve the conditions of the people amongst\n     whom your lot is cast.I am striving hard to advance my people to\n     a higher state of development, and to unite both this and all\n     other nations within the 'Four Seas' under one common\n     brotherhood.To the several questions put in your note the\n     following are the answers:--Kwoh Sung-Ling has retired from\n     official life, and is now living at home.Yang Ta Jen died a\n     great many years ago.Na Wang's adopted son is doing well, and is\n     the colonel of a regiment, with 500 men under him.The Pa to'\n     Chiaow Bridge, which you destroyed, was rebuilt very soon after\n     you left China, and it is now in very good condition.\"Kwoh Ta jen, the Chinese Minister, wrote to me that he had the\n     pleasure of seeing you in London.I wished I had been there also\n     to see you; but the responsibilities of life are so distributed\n     to different individuals in different parts of the world, that it\n     is a wise economy of Providence that we are not all in the same\n     spot.\"I wish you all manner of happiness and prosperity.With my\n     highest regards,--I remain, yours very truly\n\n               \"(For LI HUNG CHANG),        TSENG LAISUN.\"Under the belief that Hart's telegram emanated from Li Hung Chang, and\ninspired by loyalty to a friend in a difficulty, as well as by\naffection for the Chinese people, whom in his own words he \"liked best\nnext after his own,\" Gordon replied to this telegram in the following\nmessage: \"Inform Hart Gordon will leave for Shanghai first\nopportunity.At that moment China seemed on the verge of war with Russia, in\nconsequence of the disinclination of the latter power to restore the\nprovince of Kuldja, which she had occupied at the time of the\nMahommedan uprising in Central Asia.The Chinese official, Chung How,\nwho had signed an unpopular treaty at Livadia, had been sentenced to\ndeath--the treaty itself had been repudiated--and hostilities were\neven said to have commenced.The announcement that the Chinese\nGovernment had invited Gordon to Peking, and that he had promptly\nreplied that he would come, was also interpreted as signifying the\nresolve to carry matters with a high hand, and to show the world that\nChina was determined to obtain what she was entitled to.Those persons\nwho have a contemptuous disregard for dates went so far even as to\nassert that Gordon had resigned because of the Chinese invitation.Never was there a clearer case of _post hoc, propter hoc_; but even\nthe officials at the War Office were suspicious in the matter, and\ntheir attitude towards Gordon went near to precipitate the very\ncatastrophe they wanted to avoid.On the same day (8th June) as he telegraphed his reply to the Chinese\ninvitation, he telegraphed to Colonel Grant, Deputy Adjutant-General\nfor the Royal Engineers at the Horse Guards: \"Obtain me leave until\nend of the year; am invited to China; will not involve Government.\"Considering the position between China and Russia, and the concern of\nthe Russian press and Government at the report about Gordon, it is not\nsurprising that this request was not granted a ready approval.The\nofficial reply came back: \"Must state more specifically purpose and\nposition for and in which you go to China.\"To this Gordon sent the\nfollowing characteristic answer: \"Am ignorant; will write from China\nbefore the expiration of my leave.\"An answer like this savoured of\ninsubordination, and shows how deeply Gordon was hurt by the want of\nconfidence reposed in him.In saying this I disclaim all intention of\ncriticising the authorities, for whose view there was some reasonable\njustification; but the line they took, while right enough for an\nordinary Colonel of Engineers, was not quite a considerate one in the\ncase of an officer of such an exceptional position and well-known\nidiosyncrasies as \"Chinese\" Gordon.On that ground alone may it be\nsuggested that the blunt decision thus given in the final official\ntelegram--\"Reasons insufficient; your going to China is not approved,\"\nwas somewhat harsh.It was also impotent, for it rather made Gordon persist in carrying\nout his resolve than deterred him from doing so.His reply was thus\nworded: \"Arrange retirement, commutation, or resignation of service;\nask Campbell reasons.My counsel, if asked, would be for peace, not\nwar.Gordon's mind was fully made up to go, even\nif he had to sacrifice his commission.Without waiting for any further\ncommunication he left Bombay.As he had insisted on repaying Lord\nRipon his passage-money from England to India which, owing to his\nresignation, the Viceroy would otherwise have had to pay out of his\nown pocket, Gordon was quite without funds, and he had to borrow the\nsum required to defray his passage to China.But having made up his\nmind, such trifling difficulties were not likely to deter him.He\nsailed from Bombay, not merely under the displeasure of his superiors\nand uncertain as to his own status, but also in that penniless\ncondition, which was not wholly out of place in his character of\nknight-errant.But with that solid good sense, which so often\nretrieved his reputation in the eyes of the world, he left behind him\nthe following public proclamation as to his mission and intentions.It\nwas at once a public explanation of his proceedings, and a declaration\nof a pacific policy calculated to appease both official and Russian\nirritation:\n\n     \"My fixed desire is to persuade the Chinese not to go to war with\n     Russia, both in their own interests and for the sake of those of\n     the world, especially those of England.In the event of war\n     breaking out I cannot answer how I should act for the present,\n     but I should ardently desire a speedy peace.It is my fixed\n     desire, as I have said, to persuade the Chinese not to go to war\n     with Russia.To me it appears that the question in dispute cannot\n     be of such vital importance that an arrangement could not be come\n     to by concessions upon both sides.Whether I succeed in being\n     heard or not is not in my hands.I protest, however, at being\n     regarded as one who wishes for war in any country, still less in\n     China.Inclined as I am, with only a small degree of admiration\n     for military exploits, I esteem it a far greater honour to\n     promote peace than to gain any paltry honours in a wretched war.\"With that message to his official superiors, as well as to the world,\nGordon left Bombay on 13th June.His message of the day before saying,\n\"Consult Campbell,\" had induced the authorities at the Horse Guards to\nmake inquiries of that gentleman, who had no difficulty in satisfying\nthem that the course of events was exactly as has here been set forth,\nand coupling that with Gordon's own declaration that he was for peace\nnot war, permission was granted to Gordon to do that which at all cost\nhe had determined to do.When he reached Ceylon he found this\ntelegram: \"Leave granted on your engaging to take no military service\nin China,\" and he somewhat too comprehensively, and it may even be\nfeared rashly if events had turned out otherwise, replied: \"I will\ntake no military service in China: I would never embarrass the British\nGovernment.\"Having thus got clear of the difficulties which beset him on the\nthreshold of his mission, Gordon had to prepare himself for those that\nwere inherent to the task he had taken up.He knew of old how averse\nthe Chinese are to take advice from any one, how they waste time in\nfathoming motives, and how when they say a thing shall be done it is\nnever performed.Yet the memory of his former disinterested and\nsplendid service afforded a guarantee that if they would take advice\nand listen to unflattering criticism from any one, that man was\nGordon.Still, from the most favourable point of view, the mission was\nfraught with difficulty, and circumstances over which he had no\ncontrol, and of which he was even ignorant, added immensely to it.There is no doubt that Peking was at that moment the centre of\nintrigues, not only between the different Chinese leaders, but also\namong the representatives of the Foreign Powers.The secret history of\nthese transactions has still to be revealed, and as our Foreign Office\nnever gives up the private instructions it transmits to its\nrepresentatives, the full truth may never be recorded.But so far as\nthe British Government was concerned, its action was limited to giving\nthe Minister, Sir Thomas Wade, instructions to muzzle Gordon and\nprevent his doing anything that wasn't strictly in accordance with\nofficial etiquette and quite safe, or, in a word, to make him do\nnothing.The late Sir Thomas Wade was a most excellent Chinese scholar\nand estimable person in every way, but when he tried to do what the\nBritish Government and the whole arrayed body of the Horse Guards,\nfrom the Commander-in-Chief down to the Deputy-Adjutant General, had\nfailed to do, viz.to keep Gordon in leading strings, he egregiously\nfailed.Sir Thomas Wade went so far as to order Gordon to stay in the\nBritish Legation, and to visit no one without his express permission.Gordon's reply was to ignore the British Legation and to never enter\nits portals during the whole of his stay in China.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.That was one difficulty in the situation apart from the Russian\nquestion, but it was not the greatest, and as it was the first\noccasion on which European politics re-acted in a marked way on the\nsituation in China, such details as are ascertainable are well worth\nrecording at some length.There is no doubt that the Russian Government was very much disturbed\nat what seemed an inevitable hostile collision with China.The\nuncertain result of such a contest along an enormous land-frontier,\nwith which, at that time, Russia had very imperfect means of\ncommunication, was the least cause of its disquietude.A war with\nChina signified to Russia something much more serious than this, viz.,\na breach of the policy of friendship to its vast neighbour, which it\nhad consistently pursued for two centuries, and which it will pursue\nuntil it is ready to absorb, and then in the same friendly guise, its\nshare of China.Under these circumstances the Russian Government\nlooked round for every means of averting the catastrophe.It is\nnecessary to guard oneself from seeming to imply that Russia was in\nany sense afraid, or doubtful as to the result of a war with China;\nher sole motives were those of astute and far-seeing policy.Whether\nthe Russian Ambassador at Berlin mooted the matter to Prince\nBismarck, or whether that statesman, without inspiration, saw his\nchance of doing Russia a good turn at no cost to himself is not\ncertain, but instructions were sent to Herr von Brandt, the German\nMinister at Peking, a man of great energy, and in favour of bold\nmeasures, to support the Peace Party in every way.He was exactly a\nman after Prince Bismarck's own heart, prepared to go to any lengths\nto attain his object, and fully persuaded that the end justifies the\nmeans.Li Hung Chang, the\nonly prominent advocate of peace, was to rebel, march on Peking with\nhis Black Flag army, and establish a Government of his own.There is\nno doubt whatever that this scheme was formed and impressed on Li Hung\nChang as the acme of wisdom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.More than that, it was supported by two\nother Foreign Ministers at Peking, with greater or less warmth, and\none of them was Sir Thomas Wade.These plots were dispelled by the\nsound sense and candid but firm representations of Gordon.But for\nhim, as will be seen, there would have been a rebellion in the\ncountry, and Li Hung Chang would now be either Emperor of China or a\nmere instance of a subject who had lost his head in trying to be\nsupreme.Having thus explained the situation that awaited Gordon, it is\nnecessary to briefly trace his movements after leaving Ceylon.He\nreached Hongkong on 2nd July, and not only stayed there for a day or\ntwo as the guest of the Governor, Sir T. Pope Hennessey, but found\nsufficient time to pay a flying visit to the Chinese city of Canton.Thence he proceeded to Shanghai and Chefoo.At the latter place he\nfound news, which opened his eyes to part of the situation, in a\nletter from Sir Robert Hart, begging him to come direct to him at\nPeking, and not to stop _en route_ to visit Li Hung Chang at Tientsin.As has been explained, Gordon went to China in the full belief that,\nwhatever names were used, it was his old colleague Li Hung Chang who\nsent for him, and the very first definite information he received on\napproaching the Chinese capital was that not Li, but persons whom by\ninference were inimical to Li, had sent for him.The first question\nthat arises then was who was the real author of the invitation to\nGordon that bore the name of Hart.It cannot be answered, for Gordon\nassured me that he himself did not know; but there is no doubt that it\nformed part of the plot and counter-plot originated by the German\nMinister, and responded to by those who were resolved, in the event of\nLi's rebellion, to uphold the Dragon Throne.Sir Robert Hart is a man\nof long-proved ability and address, who has rendered the Chinese\nalmost as signal service as did Gordon himself, and on this occasion\nhe was actuated by the highest possible motives, but it must be\nrecorded that his letter led to a temporary estrangement between\nhimself and Gordon, who I am happy to be able to state positively did\nrealise long afterwards that he and Hart were fighting in the same\ncamp, and had the same objects in view--only this was not apparent at\nthe time.Gordon went to China only because he thought Li Hung Chang\nsent for him, but when he found that powerful persons were inciting\nhim to revolt, he became the first and most strenuous in his advice\nagainst so imprudent and unpatriotic a measure.Sir Robert Hart knew\nexactly what was being done by the German Minister.He wished to save\nGordon from being drawn into a dangerous and discreditable plot, and\nalso in the extreme eventuality to deprive any rebellion of the\nsupport of Gordon's military genius.But without this perfect information, and for the best, as in the end\nit proved, Gordon, hot with disappointment that the original summons\nwas not from Li Hung Chang, went straight to that statesman's yamen at\nTientsin, ignored Hart, and proclaimed that he had come as the friend\nof the only man who had given any sign of an inclination to regenerate\nChina.He resided as long as he was in Northern China with Li Hung\nChang, whom he found being goaded towards high treason by persons who\nhad no regard for China's interests, and who thought only of the\nattainment of their own selfish designs.The German Minister, thinking\nthat he had obtained an ally who would render the success of his own\nplan certain, proposed that Gordon should put himself at the head of\nLi's army, march on Peking, and depose the Emperor.Gordon's droll\ncomment on this is: \"I told him I was equal to a good deal of\nfilibustering, but that this was beyond me, and that I did not think\nthere was the slightest chance of such a project succeeding, as Li had\nnot a sufficient following to give it any chance of success.\"He\nrecorded his views of the situation in the following note: \"The only\nthing that keeps me in China is Li Hung Chang's safety--if he were\nsafe I would not care--but some people are egging him on to rebel,\nsome to this, and some to that, and all appears in a helpless drift.There are parties at Peking who would drive the Chinese into war for\ntheir own ends.\"Having measured the position and found it bristling\nwith unexpected difficulties and dangers, Gordon at once regretted the\npromise he had given his own Government in the message from Ceylon.He\nthought it was above all things necessary for him to have a free hand,\nand he consequently sent the following telegram to the Horse Guards:\n\"I have seen Li Hung Chang, and he wishes me to stay with him.I\ncannot desert China in her present crisis, and would be free to act\nas I think fit.I therefore beg to resign my commission in Her\nMajesty's Service.\"Having thus relieved, as he thought, his\nGovernment of all responsibility for his acts--although they responded\nto this message by accusing him of insubordination, and by instructing\nSir Thomas Wade to place him under moral arrest--Gordon threw himself\ninto the China difficulty with his usual ardour.Nothing more remained\nto be done at Tientsin, where he had effectually checked the\npernicious counsel pressed on Li Hung Chang most strongly by the\nGerman Minister, and in a minor degree by the representatives of\nFrance and England.In order to influence the Central Government it\nwas necessary for him to proceed to Peking, and the following\nunpublished letter graphically describes his views at the particular\nmoment:--\n\n     \"I am on my way to Peking.There are three parties--Li Hung Chang\n     (1), the Court (2), the Literary Class (3).The two first are for\n     peace, but dare not say it for fear of the third party.I have\n     told Li that he, in alliance with the Court, must coerce the\n     third party, and have written this to Li and to the Court Party.By so doing I put my head in jeopardy in going to Peking.I do\n     not wish Li to act alone.It is not good he should do anything\n     except support the Court Party morally.God will overrule for the\n     best.If neither the Court Party nor Li can act, if these two\n     remain and let things drift, then there will be a disastrous war,\n     of which I shall not see the end.Having given up my commission, I have nothing to look for, and\n     indeed I long for the quiet of the future.... If the third party\n     hear of my recommendation before the Court Party acts, then I may\n     be doomed to a quick exit at Peking.Li Hung Chang is a noble\n     fellow, and worth giving one's life for; but he must not rebel\n     and lose his good name.It is a sort of general election which is\n     going on, but where heads are in gage.\"Writing to me some months later, General Gordon entered into various\nmatters relating to this period, and as the letter indirectly throws\nlight on what may be called the Li Hung Chang episode, I quote it\nhere, although somewhat out of its proper place:--\n\n     \"Thanks for your kind note.I send you the two papers which were\n     made public in China, and through the Shen-pao some of it was\n     sent over.Another paper of fifty-two articles I gave Li Hung\n     Chang, but I purposely kept no copy of it, for it went into--\n\n     \"1.The contraband of salt and opium at Hongkong.The advantages of telegraphs and canals, not railways, which\n     have ruined Egypt and Turkey by adding to the financial\n     difficulties.The effeteness of the Chinese representatives abroad, etc.,\n     etc., etc.\"I wrote as a Chinaman for the Chinese.I recommended Chinese\n     merchants to do away with middle-men, and to have Government aid\n     and encouragement to create houses or firms in London, etc.; to\n     make their own cotton goods, etc.In fact, I wrote as a Chinaman.I see now and then symptoms that they are awake to the situation,\n     for my object has been always to put myself into the skin of\n     those I may be with, and I like these people as much--well, say\n     nearly as much--as I like my countrymen.\"There are a lot of people in China who would egg on revolts of A\n     and B. All this is wrong.I painted this\n     picture to the Chinese of 1900: 'Who are those people hanging\n     about with jinrickshas?''The Hongs of the European merchants,'\n     etc., etc.\"People have asked me what I thought of the advance of China\n     during the sixteen years I was absent.They looked superficially\n     at the power military of China.You\n     come, I must go; but I go on to say that the stride China has\n     made in commerce is immense, and commerce and wealth are the\n     power of nations, not the troops.Like the Chinese, I have a\n     great contempt for military prowess.A military Red-Button mandarin has\n     to bow low to a Blue-Button civil mandarin, and rightly so to my\n     mind.\"I wrote the other day to Li Hung Chang to protest against the\n     railway from Ichang to Peking along the Grand Canal.In making it\n     they would enter into no end of expenses, the coin would leave\n     the country and they would not understand it, and would be\n     fleeced by the financial cormorants of Great Britain.Having arrived at Peking, Gordon was received in several councils by\nPrince Chun, the father of the young Emperor and the recognised leader\nof the War Party.The leading members of the Grand Council were also\npresent, and Gordon explained his views to them at length.In the\nfirst place, he said, if there were war he would only stay to help\nthem on condition that they destroyed the suburbs of Peking, allowed\nhim to place the city in a proper state of defence, and removed the\nEmperor and Court to a place of safety.When they expressed their\nopinion that the Taku forts were impregnable, Gordon laughed, and said\nthey could be taken from the rear.The whole gist of his remarks was\nthat \"they could not go to war,\" and when they still argued in the\nopposite sense, and the interpreter refused to translate the harsh\nepithets he applied to such august personages, he took the dictionary,\nlooked out the Chinese equivalent for \"idiocy,\" and with his finger on\nthe word, placed it under the eyes of each member of the Council.The\nend of this scene may be described in Gordon's own words: \"I said make\npeace, and wrote out the terms.They were, in all, five articles; the\nonly one they boggled at was the fifth, about the indemnity.They said\nthis was too hard and unjust.I said that might be, but what was the\nuse of talking about it?If a man demanded your money or your life,\nyou have only three courses open.You must either fight, call for\nhelp, or give up your money.Now, as you cannot fight, it is useless\nto call for help, since neither England nor France would stir a finger\nto assist you.I believe these are the articles now under discussion\nat St Petersburg, and the only one on which there is any question is\nthe fifth.\"This latter statement I may add, without going into the\nquestion of the Marquis Tseng's negotiations in the Russian capital,\nwas perfectly correct.Gordon drew up several notes or memorandums for the information of the\nChinese Government.The first of these was mainly military, and the\nfollowing extracts will suffice:--\n\n     \"China's power lies in her numbers, in the quick moving of her\n     troops, in the little baggage they require, and in their few\n     wants.It is known that men armed with sword and spear can\n     overcome the best regular troops equipped with breech-loading\n     rifles, if the country is at all difficult and if the men with\n     spears and swords outnumber their foe ten to one.If this is the\n     case where men are armed with spears and swords, it will be much\n     truer when those men are themselves armed with breech loaders.Her strength is in\n     quiet movements, in cutting off trains of baggage, and in night\n     attacks _not pushed home_--in a continuous worrying of her\n     enemies.No artillery\n     should be moved with the troops; it delays and impedes them.Infantry fire is the most fatal fire; guns make a noise far out\n     of proportion to their value in war.If guns are taken into the\n     field, troops cannot march faster than these guns.The degree of\n     speed at which the guns can be carried dictates the speed at\n     which the troops can march.As long as Peking is the centre of\n     the Government of China, China can never go to war with any\n     first-class power; it is too near the sea.\"The second memorandum was of greater importance and more general\napplication.In it he compressed the main heads of his advice into the\nsmallest possible space, and so far as it was at all feasible to treat\na vast and complicated subject within the limits of a simple and\npractical scheme, he therein shows with the greatest clearness how the\nregeneration of China might be brought about.\"In spite of the opinion of some foreigners, it will be generally\n     acknowledged that the Chinese are contented and happy, that the\n     country is rich and prosperous, and that the people are _au fond_\n     united in their sentiments, and ardently desire to remain a\n     nation.At constant intervals, however, the whole of this human\n     hive is stirred by some dispute between the Pekin Government and\n     some foreign Power; the Chinese people, proud of their ancient\n     prestige, applaud the high tone taken up by the Pekin Government,\n     crediting the Government with the power to support their strong\n     words.This goes on for a time, when the Government gives in, and\n     corresponding vexation is felt by the people.The recurrence of\n     these disputes, the inevitable surrender ultimately of the Pekin\n     Government, has the tendency of shaking the Chinese people's\n     confidence in the Central Government.The Central Government\n     appreciates the fact that, little by little, this prestige is\n     being destroyed by their own actions among the Chinese people,\n     each crisis then becomes more accentuated or difficult to\n     surmount, as the Central Government know each concession is\n     another nail in their coffin.The Central Government fear that\n     the taking up of a spirited position by any pre-eminent Chinese\n     would carry the Chinese people with him, and therefore the\n     Central Government endeavour to keep up appearances, and to skirt\n     the precipice of war as near as they possibly can, while never\n     intending to enter into war.\"The Central Government residing in the extremity of the Middle\n     Kingdom, away from the great influences which are now working in\n     China, can never alter one iota from what they were years ago:\n     they are being steadily left behind by the people they govern.They know this, and endeavour to stem these influences in all\n     ways in their power, hoping to keep the people backward and in\n     ignorance, and to <DW44> their progress to the same pace they\n     themselves go, if it can be called a pace at all.\"It is therefore a maxim that 'no progress can be made by the\n     Pekin Government.'To them any progress, whether slow or quick,\n     is synonymous to slow or quick extinction, for they will never\n     move.\"The term 'Pekin Government' is used advisedly, for if the\n     Central Government were moved from Pekin into some province where\n     the pulsations and aspirations of the Chinese people could have\n     their legitimate effect, then the Central Government and the\n     Chinese people, having a unison of thought, would work together.\"From what has been said above, it is maintained that, so long as\n     the Central Government of China isolates itself from the Chinese\n     people by residing aloof at Pekin, so long will the Chinese\n     people have to remain passive under the humiliations which come\n     upon them through the non-progressive and destructive disposition\n     of their Government.These humiliations will be the chronic state\n     of the Chinese people until the Central Government moves from\n     Pekin and reunites itself to its subjects.No army, no", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "There is, however, the probability that a proud people like\n     the Chinese may sicken at this continual eating of humble pie,\n     that the Pekin Government at some time, by skirting too closely\n     the precipice of war may fall into it, and then that sequence may\n     be anarchy and rebellion throughout the Middle Kingdom which may\n     last for years and cause endless misery.\"It may be asked--How can the present state of things be altered?How can China maintain the high position that the wealth,\n     industry, and innate goodness of the Chinese people entitle her\n     to have among the nations of the world?Some may say by the\n     revolt of this Chinaman or of that Chinaman.To me this seems\n     most undesirable, for, in the first place, such action would not\n     have the blessing of God, and, in the second, it would result in\n     the country being plunged into civil war.The fair, upright, and\n     open course for the Chinese people to take is to work, through\n     the Press and by petitions, on the Central Government, and to\n     request them to move from Pekin, and bring themselves thus more\n     into unison with the Chinese people, and thus save that people\n     the constant humiliations they have to put up with, owing to the\n     seat of the Central Government being at Pekin.This\n     recommendation would need no secret societies, no rebellion, no\n     treason; if taken up and persevered in it must succeed, and not\n     one life need be lost.\"The Central Government at Pekin could not answer the Chinese\n     people except in the affirmative when the Chinese people say to\n     the Central Government--'By your residing aloof from us in Pekin,\n     where you are exposed to danger, you separate our interests from\n     yours, and you bring on us humiliation, which we would never have\n     to bear if you resided in the interior.Take our application into\n     consideration, and grant our wishes.'\"I have been kindly treated by the Central Pekin Government and\n     by the Chinese people; it is for the welfare of both parties that\n     I have written and signed this paper.I may have expressed myself\n     too strongly with respect to the non-progressive nature of the\n     Pekin Government, who may desire the welfare of the Middle\n     Kingdom as ardently as any other Chinese, but as long as the\n     Pekin Government allow themselves to be led and directed by those\n     drones of the hive, the Censors, so long must the Pekin\n     Government bear the blame earned by those drones in plunging\n     China into difficulties.In the insect world the bees get rid of\n     the drones in winter.\"There was yet a third memorandum of a confidential nature written to\nLi Hung Chang himself, of which Gordon did not keep a copy, but he\nreferred to it in the letter written to myself which I have already\nquoted.: the prevention of war\nbetween Russia and China, and of a rebellion on the part of Li Hung\nChang under European advice and encouragement, Gordon left China\nwithout any delay.When he reached Shanghai on 16th August he found\nanother official telegram awaiting him: \"Leave cancelled, resignation\nnot accepted.\"As he had already taken his passage home he did not\nreply, but when he reached Aden he telegraphed as follows: \"You might\nhave trusted me.My passage from China was taken days before the\narrival of your telegram which states 'leave cancelled.'Do you insist\non rescinding the same?\"The next day he received a reply granting him\nnearly six months' leave, and with that message the question of his\nalleged insubordination may be treated as finally settled.There can\nbe no doubt that among his many remarkable achievements not the least\ncreditable was this mission to China, when by downright candour, and\nunswerving resolution in doing the right thing, he not merely\npreserved peace, but baffled the intrigues of unscrupulous\ndiplomatists and selfish governments.With that incident closed Gordon's connection with China, the country\nassociated with his most brilliant feats of arms, but in concluding\nthis chapter it seems to me that I should do well to record some later\nexpressions of opinion on that subject.The following interesting\nletter, written on the eve of the war between France and China in\n1882, was published by the _New York Herald_:--\n\n     \"The Chinese in their affairs with foreign nations are fully\n     aware of their peculiar position, and count with reason that a\n     war with either France or another Power will bring them perforce\n     allies outside of England.The only Power that could go to war\n     with them with impunity is Russia, who can attack them by land.I\n     used the following argument to them when I was there:--The\n     present dynasty of China is a usurping one--the Mantchou.We may\n     say that it exists by sufferance at Pekin, and nowhere else in\n     the Empire.If you look at the map of China Pekin is at the\n     extremity of the Empire and not a week's marching from the\n     Russian frontier.A war with Russia would imply the capture of\n     Pekin and the fall of the Mantchou dynasty, which would never\n     dare to leave it, for if they did the Chinamen in the south would\n     smite them.I said, 'If you go to war then move the Queen\n     Bee--_i.e._ the Emperor--into the centre of China and then fight;\n     if not, you must make peace.'The two Powers who can coerce China\n     are Russia and England.Russia could march without much\n     difficulty on Pekin.This much would not hurt trade, so England\n     would not interfere.England could march to Taku and Pekin and no\n     one would object, for she would occupy the Treaty Ports.But if\n     France tried to do so England would object.Thus it is that China\n     will only listen to Russia and England, and eventually she must\n     fear Russia the most of all Powers, for she can never get over\n     the danger of the land journey, but she might, by a great\n     increase of her fleet, get over the fear of England.I say China,\n     but I mean the Mantchou dynasty, for the Mantchous are despised\n     by the Chinese.Any war with China would be for France expensive\n     and dangerous, not from the Chinese forces, which would be soon\n     mastered, but from the certainty of complications with England.As for the European population in China, write them down as\n     identical with those in Egypt in all affairs.Their sole idea is,\n     without any distinction of nationality, an increased power over\n     China for their own trade and for opening up the country as they\n     call it, and any war would be popular with them; so they will egg\n     on any Power to make it.My idea is that no colonial or foreign\n     community in a foreign land can properly, and for the general\n     benefit of the world, consider the questions of that foreign\n     State.The leading idea is how they will benefit themselves.The\n     Isle of Bourbon or Reunion is the cause of the Madagascar war.It\n     is egged on by the planters there, and to my idea they (the\n     planters) want slaves for Madagascar.I have a very mean opinion\n     of the views of any colonial or foreign community: though I own\n     that they are powerful for evil.Who would dare to oppose the\n     European colony in Egypt or China, and remain in those\n     countries?\"In a letter to myself, written about this time, very much the same\nviews are expressed:--\n\n     \"I do not think I could enlighten _you_ about China.Her game is\n     and will be to wait events, and she will try and work so as to\n     embroil us with France if she does go to war.For this there\n     would be plenty of elements in the Treaty Ports.One may say,\n     humanly speaking, China going to war with France must entail our\n     following suit.It would be a bad thing in some ways for\n     civilization, for the Chinese are naturally so bumptious that any\n     success would make them more so, and if allied to us, and they\n     had success, it would be a bad look-out afterwards.Li Hung Chang as Emperor, if such a thing came to pass,\n     would be worse than the present Emperor, for he is sharp and\n     clever, would unite China under a Chinese dynasty, and be much\n     more troublesome to deal with.Altogether, I cannot think that\n     the world would gain if China went to war with France.Also I\n     think it would be eventually bad for China.China being a queer\n     country, we might expect queer things, and I believe if she did\n     go to war she would contract with Americans for the destruction\n     of French fleet, and she would let loose a horde of adventurers\n     with dynamite.This is essentially her style of action, and Li\n     Hung Chang would take it up, but do not say I think so.\"In a further letter from Jaffa, dated 17th November 1883, he wrote\nfinally on this branch of the subject:--\n\n     \"I fear I can write nothing of any import, so I will not attempt\n     it.To you I can remark that if I were the Government I would\n     consider the part that should be taken when the inevitable fall\n     of the Mantchou dynasty takes place, what steps they would take,\n     and how they would act in the break-up, which, however, will only\n     end in a fresh cohesion of China, for we, or no other Power,\n     could never for long hold the country.At Penang, Singapore,\n     etc., the Chinese will eventually oust us in another generation.\"There was one other question about China upon which Gordon felt very\nstrongly, viz., the opium question, and as he expressed views which I\ncombated, I feel bound to end this chapter by quoting what he wrote on\nthis much-discussed topic.On one point he agrees with myself and his\nother opponents in admitting that the main object with the Chinese\nauthorities was increased revenue, not morality.They have since\nattained their object not only by an increased import duty, but also\nin the far more extensive cultivation of the native drug, to which the\nEmperor, by Imperial Edict, has given his formal sanction:--\n\n                                   \"PORT LOUIS, _3rd February 1882_.\"About the opium article, I think your article--'History of the\n     Opium Traffic,' _Times_, 4th January 1884--reads well.The Chinese _amour propre_ as a nation is hurt\n     by the enforced entry of the drug.This irritation is connected\n     with the remembrance of the wars which led to the Treaties about\n     opium.Had eggs or apples been the cause of the wars, _i.e._ had\n     the Chinese objected to the import of eggs, and we had insisted\n     on their being imported, and carried out such importation in\n     spite of the Chinese wish by force of war, it would be to my own\n     mind the same thing as opium now is to Chinese.We do not give\n     the Chinese credit for being so sensitive as they are.As Black\n     Sea Treaty was to Russia so opium trade is to China.\"I take the root of the question to be as above.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.I do not mean to\n     say that all that they urge is fictitious about morality; and I\n     would go further than you, and say I think they would willingly\n     give up their revenue from opium, indeed I am sure of it, if they\n     could get rid of the forced importation by treaty, but their\n     action in so doing would be simply one of satisfying their _amour\n     propre_.The opium importation is a constant reminder of their\n     defeats, and I feel sure China will never be good friends with us\n     till it is abolished.It is for that reason I would give it up,\n     for I think the only two alliances worth having are France and\n     China.\"I have never, when I have written on it, said anything further\n     than this, _i.e.the Chinese Government will not have it_, let us\n     say it is a good drug or not.I also say that it is not fair to\n     force anything on your neighbour, and, therefore, morally, it is\n     wrong, even if it was eggs.\"Further, I say that through our thrusting these eggs on China,\n     this opium, we caused the wars with China which shook the\n     prestige of the Pekin Government, and the outcome of this war of\n     1842 was the Taeping Rebellion, with its deaths of 13,000,000.The military prestige of the Mantchous was shaken by these\n     defeats, the heavy contributions for war led to thousands of\n     soldiers being disbanded, to a general impoverishment of the\n     people, and this gave the rebel chief, Hung-tsew-tsiuen, his\n     chance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.\"A wants B to let him import eggs, B refuses, A coerces him;\n     therefore I say it is wrong, and that it is useless discussing\n     whether eggs are good or not.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.\"Can anyone doubt but that, if the Chinese Government had the\n     power, they would stop importation to-morrow?If so, why keep a\n     pressure like this on China whom we need as a friend, and with\n     whom this importation is and ever will be the sole point about\n     which we could be at variance?I know this is the point with Li\n     Hung Chang.\"People may laugh at _amour propre_ of China.It is a positive\n     fact, they are most-pigheaded on those points.China is the only\n     nation in the world which is forced to take a thing she does not\n     want.England is the only nation which forces another nation to\n     do this, in order to benefit India by this act.\"Note this, only certain classes of vessels are subject to the\n     Foreign Customs Office at Canton.By putting all vessels under\n     that Office the Chinese Government would make L2,000,000 a year\n     more revenue.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.The Chinese Government will not do this however,\n     because it would put power in hands of foreigners, so they lose\n     it.Did you ever read the letters of the Ambassador before\n     Marquis Tseng?His name, I think, was Coh or Kwoh.He wrote home\n     to Pekin about Manchester, telling its wonders, but adding,\n     'These people are wonderful, but the masses are miserable far\n     beyond Chinese.They think only of money and not of the welfare\n     of the people.'\"Any foreign nation can raise the bile of Chinese by saying,\n     'Look at the English, they forced you to take their opium.'\"I should not be a bit surprised did I hear that Li Hung Chang\n     smoked opium himself.I know a lot of the princes do, so they\n     say.I have no doubt myself that what I have said is the true and\n     only reason, or rather root reason.Put our nation in the same\n     position of having been defeated and forced to accept some\n     article which theory used to consider bad for the health, like\n     tea used to be, we would rebel as soon as we could against it,\n     though our people drink tea.The opium trade is a standing,\n     ever-present memento of defeat and heavy payments; and the\n     Chinese cleverly take advantage of the fact that it is a\n     deleterious drug.\"The opium wars were not about opium--opium was only a _cheval de\n     bataille_.They were against the introduction of foreigners, a\n     political question, and so the question of opium import is now.As for the loss to India by giving it up, it is quite another\n     affair.On one hand you have gain, an embittered feeling and an\n     injustice; on the other you have loss, friendly nations and\n     justice.Cut down pay of all officers in India to Colonial\n     allowances _above_ rank of captains.Do not give them Indian\n     allowances, and you will cover nearly the loss, I expect.Why\n     should officers in India have more than officers in Hongkong?\"In a subsequent letter, dated from the Cape, 20th July 1882, General\nGordon replied to some objections I had raised as follows:--\n\n     \"As for the opium, to which you say the same objection applies as\n     to tea, etc., it is not so, for opium has for ages been a tabooed\n     article among Chinese respectable people.I own reluctance to\n     foreign intercourse applies to what I said, but the Chinese know\n     that the intercourse with foreigners cannot be stopped, and it,\n     as well as the forced introduction of opium, are signs of defeat;\n     yet one, that of intercourse, cannot be stopped or wiped away\n     while the opium question can be.I am writing in a hurry, so am\n     not very clear.\"What I mean is that no one country forces another country to\n     take a drug like opium, and therefore the Chinese feel the\n     forced introduction of opium as an intrusion and injustice;\n     thence their feelings in the matter.This, I feel sure, is the\n     case.\"What could our Government do _in re_ opium?Well, I should say,\n     let the clause of treaty lapse about it, and let the smuggling be\n     renewed.Hongkong is a nest of smugglers.\"Pekin would, or rather could, never succeed in cutting off\n     foreign intercourse.The Chinese are too much mixed up (and are\n     increasingly so every year) with foreigners for Pekin even to try\n     it.Also I do not think China would wish to stop its importation\n     altogether.All they ask is an increased duty on it.\"CHAPTER X.\n\nTHE MAURITIUS, THE CAPE, AND THE CONGO.There was a moment of hesitation in Gordon's mind as to whether he\nwould come home or not.His first project on laying down the Indian\nSecretaryship had been to go to Zanzibar and attack the slave trade\nfrom that side.Before his plans were matured the China offer came,\nand turned his thoughts in a different channel.On his arrival at\nAden, on the way back, he found that the late Sir William Mackinnon, a\ntruly great English patriot of the type of the merchant adventurers of\nthe Elizabethan age, had sent instructions that the ships of the\nBritish India Steam Packet Company were at his disposal to convey him\nwhereever he liked, and for a moment the thought occurred to him to\nturn aside to Zanzibar.But a little reflection led him to think that,\nas he had been accused of insubordination, it would be better for him\nto return home and report himself at headquarters.When he arrived in\nLondon at the end of October 1880, he found that his letters, written\nchiefly to his sister during his long sojourn in the Soudan, were on\nthe eve of publication by Dr Birkbeck Hill.That exceedingly\ninteresting volume placed at the disposal of the public the evidence\nas to his great work in Africa, which might otherwise have been buried\nin oblivion.It was written under considerable difficulties, for\nGordon would not see Dr Hill, and made a stringent proviso that he was\nnot to be praised, and that nothing unkind was to be said about\nanyone.He did, however, stipulate for a special tribute of praise to\nbe given to his Arab secretary, Berzati Bey, \"my only companion for\nthese years--my adviser and my counsellor.\"Berzati was among those\nwho perished with the ill-fated expedition of Hicks Pasha at the end\nof 1883.To the publication of this work must be attributed the\nestablishment of Gordon's reputation as the authority on the Soudan,\nand the prophetic character of many of his statements became clear\nwhen events confirmed them.After a stay at Southampton and in London of a few weeks, Gordon was\nat last induced to give himself a short holiday, and, strangely\nenough, he selected Ireland as his recreation ground.I have been told\nthat Gordon had a strain of Irish blood in him, but I have failed to\ndiscover it genealogically, nor was there any trace of its influence\non his character.He was not fortunate in the season of the year he\nselected, nor in the particular part of the country he chose for his\nvisit.There is scenery in the south-west division of Ireland, quite\napart from the admitted beauty of the Killarney district, that will\nvie with better known and more highly lauded places in Scotland and\nSwitzerland, but no one would recommend a stranger to visit that\nquarter of Ireland at the end of November, and the absence of\ncultivation, seen under the depressing conditions of Nature, would\nstrike a visitor with all the effect of absolute sterility.Gordon was\nso impressed, and it seemed to him that the Irish peasants of a whole\nprovince were existing in a state of wretchedness exceeding anything\nhe had seen in either China or the Soudan.If he had seen the same\nplaces six months earlier, he would have formed a less extreme view of\ntheir situation.It was just the condition of things that appealed to\nhis sympathy, and with characteristic promptitude he put his views on\npaper, making one definite offer on his own part, and sent them to a\nfriend, the present General James Donnelly, a distinguished engineer\nofficer and old comrade, and moreover a member of a well-known Irish\nfamily.Considering the contents of the letter, and the form in which\nGordon threw out his suggestions, it is not very surprising that\nGeneral Donnelly sent it to _The Times_, in which it was published on\n3rd December 1880; but Gordon himself was annoyed at this step being\ntaken, because he realised that he had written somewhat hastily on a\nsubject with which he could scarcely be deemed thoroughly acquainted.The following is its text:--\n\n     \"You are aware how interested I am in the welfare of this\n     country, and, having known you for twenty-six years, I am sure I\n     may say the same of you.\"I have lately been over to the south-west of Ireland in the hope\n     of discovering how some settlement could be made of the Irish\n     question, which, like a fretting cancer, eats away our vitals as\n     a nation.\"I have come to the conclusion that--\n\n     \"1.A gulf of antipathy exists between the landlords and tenants\n     of the north-west, west, and south-west of Ireland.It is a gulf\n     which is not caused alone by the question of rent; there is a\n     complete lack of sympathy between these two classes.It is\n     useless to inquire how such a state of things has come to pass.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.I\n     call your attention to the pamphlets, letters, and speeches of\n     the landlord class, as a proof of how little sympathy or kindness\n     there exists among them for the tenantry, and I am sure that the\n     tenantry feel in the same way towards the landlords.No half-measured Acts which left the landlords with any say\n     to the tenantry of these portions of Ireland will be of any use.They would be rendered--as past Land Acts in Ireland have\n     been--quite abortive, for the landlords will insert clauses to do\n     away with their force.Any half-measures will only place the\n     Government face to face with the people of Ireland as the\n     champions of the landlord interest.The Government would be bound\n     to enforce their decision, and with a result which none can\n     foresee, but which certainly would be disastrous to the common\n     weal.My idea is that, seeing--through this cause or that, it is\n     immaterial to examine--a deadlock has occurred between the\n     present landlords and tenants, the Government should purchase up\n     the rights of the landlords over the whole or the greater part of\n     Longford, Westmeath, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Leitrim,\n     Sligo, Mayo, Cavan, and Donegal.The yearly rental of these\n     districts is some four millions; if the Government give the\n     landlords twenty years' purchase, it would cost eighty millions,\n     which at three and a half per cent.would give a yearly interest\n     of L2,800,000, of which L2,500,000 could be recovered; the lands\n     would be Crown lands; they would be administered by a Land\n     Commission, who would be supplemented by an Emigration\n     Commission, which might for a short time need L100,000.This\n     would not injure the landlords, and, so far as it is an\n     interference with proprietary rights, it is as just as is the law\n     which forces Lord A. to allow a railway through his park for the\n     public benefit.I would restrain the landlords from any power or\n     control in these Crown land districts.Poor-law, roads, schools,\n     etc., should be under the Land Commission.For the rest of Ireland, I would pass an Act allowing free\n     sale of leases, fair rents, and a Government valuation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.\"In conclusion, I must say, from all accounts and my own\n     observation, that the state of our fellow-countrymen in the parts\n     I have named is worse than that of any people in the world, let\n     alone Europe.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.I believe that these people are made as we are,\n     that they are patient beyond belief, loyal, but, at the same\n     time, broken-spirited and

not endow a Catholic University in a\n     Catholic country?Is it not as difficult to get a L5 note from a\n     Protestant as from a Catholic or Jew?Read the letters of ----\n     and of ----, and tell me if you see in them any particle of kind\n     feeling towards the tenantry; and if you have any doubts about\n     this, investigate the manner in which the Relief Fund was\n     administered, and in which the sums of money for improvements of\n     estates by landlords were expended.\"In 1833 England gave freedom to the West Indian slaves at a cost\n     of twenty millions--worth now thirty millions.By an expenditure of\n     eighty millions she may free her own people.She would have the\n     hold over the land, and she would cure a cancer.I am not well\n     off, but I would offer ---- or his agent L1000, if either of them\n     would live one week in one of these poor devil's places, and feed\n     as these people do.Our comic prints do an infinity of harm by\n     their caricatures--firstly, the caricatures are not true, for the\n     crime in Ireland is not greater than that in England; and,\n     secondly, they exasperate the people on both sides of the\n     Channel, and they do no good.\"It is ill to laugh and scoff at a question which affects our\n     existence.\"This heroic mode of dealing with an old and very complicated\ndifficulty scarcely came within the range of practical achievement.The Irish question is not to be solved by any such simple\ncut-and-dried procedure.It will take time, sympathy, and good-will.When the English people have eradicated their opinion that the Irish\nare an inferior race, and when the Irish realise that the old\nprejudice has vanished, the root-difficulty will be removed.At least\nGordon deserves the credit of having seen that much from his brief\nobservation on the spot, and his plea for them as \"patient beyond\nbelief and loyal,\" may eventually carry conviction to the hearts of\nthe more powerful and prosperous kingdom.The Irish question was not the only one on which he recorded a written\nopinion.The question of retaining Candahar was very much discussed\nduring the winter of 1880-81, and as the Liberal Government was very\nmuch put to it to get high military opinion to support their proposal\nof abandonment, they were very glad when Gordon wrote to _The Times_\nexpressing a strong opinion on their side.I think the writing of that\nletter was mainly due to a sense of obligation to Lord Ripon, although\nthe argument used as to the necessity of Candahar being held by any\n_single_ ruler of Afghanistan was, and is always, unanswerable.But\nthe question at that time was this: Could any such single ruler be\nfound, and was Abdurrahman, recognised in the August of 1880 as Ameer\nof Cabul, the man?On 27th July 1880, less than eight weeks after Gordon's resignation of\nhis Indian appointment, occurred the disastrous battle of Maiwand,\nwhen Yakoob's younger brother, Ayoob, gained a decisive victory over a\nBritish force.That disaster was retrieved six weeks later by Lord\nRoberts, but Ayoob remained in possession of Herat and the whole of\nthe country west of the Helmund.It was well known that the rivalry\nbetween him and his cousin Abdurrahman did not admit of being patched\nup, and that it could only be settled by the sword.At the moment\nthere was more reason to believe in the military talent of Ayoob than\nof the present Ameer, and it was certain that the instant we left\nCandahar the two opponents would engage in a struggle for its\npossession.The policy of precipitate evacuation left everything to\nthe chapter of accidents, and if Ayoob had proved the victor, or even\nable to hold his ground, the situation in Afghanistan would have been\neminently favourable for that foreign intervention which only the\nextraordinary skill and still more extraordinary success of the Ameer\nAbdurrahman has averted.In giving the actual text of Gordon's letter,\nit is only right, while frankly admitting that the course pursued has\nproved most successful and beneficial, to record that it might well\nhave been otherwise, and that as a mere matter of argument the\nprobability was quite the other way.Neither Gordon nor any other\nsupporter of the evacuation policy ventured to predict that\nAbdurrahman, who was then not a young man, and whose early career had\nbeen one of failure, was going to prove himself the ablest\nadministrator and most astute statesman in Afghan history.\"Those who advocate the retention of Candahar do so generally on\n     the ground that its retention would render more difficult the\n     advance of Russia on, and would prevent her fomenting rebellion\n     in, India, and that our prestige in India would suffer by its\n     evacuation.\"I think that this retention would throw Afghanistan, in the hope\n     of regaining Candahar, into alliance with Russia, and that\n     thereby Russia would be given a temptation to offer which she\n     otherwise would not have.Supposing that temptation did not\n     exist, what other inducement could Russia offer for this\n     alliance?If, then, Russia did advance, she\n     would bring her auxiliary tribes, who, with their natural\n     predatory habits, would soon come to loggerheads with their\n     natural enemies, the Afghans, and that the sooner when these\n     latter were aided by us.Would the Afghans in such a case be\n     likely to be tempted by the small share they would get of the\n     plunder of India to give up their secure, independent position\n     and our alliance for that plunder, and to put their country at\n     the mercy of Russia, whom they hate as cordially as they do us?<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.If we evacuate Candahar, Afghanistan can only have this small\n     inducement of the plunder of India for Russia to offer her.Some\n     say that the people of Candahar desire our rule.I

stiff, civilized government, in spite of the increased worldly\n     prosperity the latter may give.\"We may be sure that at Candahar the spirit which induced\n     children to kill, or to attempt to kill our soldiers in 1879,\n     etc., still exists, though it may be cowed.We have trouble\n     enough with the fanatics of India; why should we go out of our\n     way to add to their numbers?\"From a military point of view, by the retention we should\n     increase the line we have to defend by twice the distance of\n     Candahar to the present frontier, and place an objective point to\n     be attacked.Naturally we should make good roads to Candahar,\n     which on the loss of a battle there--and such things must be\n     always calculated as within possibility--would aid the advance of\n     the enemy to the Indus.The _debouche_ of the defiles, with good\n     lateral communications between them, is the proper line of\n     defence for India, not the entry into those defiles, which cannot\n     have secure lateral communications.If the entries of the defiles\n     are held, good roads are made through them; and these aid the\n     enemy, if you lose the entries or have them turned.This does not\n     prevent the passage of the defiles being disputed.\"The retention of Candahar would tend to foment rebellion in\n     India, and not prevent it; for thereby we should obtain an\n     additional number of fanatical malcontents, who as British\n     subjects would have the greatest facility of passing to and fro\n     in India, which they would not have if we did not hold it.\"That our prestige would suffer in India by the evacuation I\n     doubt; it certainly would suffer if we kept it and forsook our\n     word--_i.e._ that we made war against Shere Ali, and not against\n     his people.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.The native peoples of India would willingly part with\n     any amount of prestige if they obtained less

frontier\n     will aid her.\"I am not anxious about Russia; but, were I so, I would care much\n     more to see precautions taken for the defence of our Eastern\n     colonies, now that Russia has moved her Black Sea naval\n     establishment to the China Sea, than to push forward an\n     outstretched arm to Candahar.The interests of the Empire claim\n     as much attention as India, and one cannot help seeing that they\n     are much more imperilled by this last move of Russia than by\n     anything she can do in Central Asia.\"Politically, militarily,", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "It would oblige us to keep up an interference with the\n     internal affairs of Afghanistan, would increase the expenditure\n     of impoverished India, and expose us chronically to the reception\n     of those painfully sensational telegrams of which we have had a\n     surfeit of late.\"During these few months Gordon wrote on several other subjects--the\nAbyssinian question, in connection with which he curiously enough\nstyled \"the Abyssinians the best of mountaineers,\" a fact not\nappreciated until their success over the Italians many years later,\nthe registration of slaves in Egypt, and the best way of carrying on\nirregular warfare in difficult country and against brave and active\nraces.His remarks on the last subject were called forth by our\nexperiences in the field against the Zulus in the first place, and the\nBoers in the second, and quite exceptional force was given to them by\nthe occurrence of the defeat at Majuba Hill one day after they\nappeared in the _Army and Navy Gazette_.For this reason I quote the\narticle in its entirety:--\n\n     \"The individual man of any country in which active outdoor life,\n     abstinence, hunting of wild game, and exposure to all weathers\n     are the habits of life, is more than a match for the private\n     soldier of a regular army, who is taken from the plough or from\n     cities, and this is the case doubly as much when the field of\n     operations is a difficult country, and when the former is, and\n     the latter is not, acclimatised.On the one hand, the former is\n     accustomed to the climate, knows the country, and is trained to\n     long marches and difficulties of all sorts inseparable from his\n     daily life; the latter is unacclimatised, knows nothing of the\n     country, and, accustomed to have his every want supplied, is at a\n     loss when any extraordinary hardships or difficulties are\n     encountered; he has only his skill in his arms and discipline in\n     his favour, and sometimes that skill may be also possessed by his\n     foe.The native of the country has to contend with a difficulty\n     in maintaining a long contest, owing to want of means and want of\n     discipline, being unaccustomed to any yoke interfering with\n     individual freedom.The resources of a regular army, in\n     comparison to those of the natives of the country, are infinite,\n     but it is accustomed to discipline.In a difficult country, when\n     the numbers are equal, and when the natives are of the\n     description above stated, the regular forces are certainly at a\n     very great disadvantage, until, by bitter experience in the\n     field, they are taught to fight in the same irregular way as\n     their foes, and this lesson may be learnt at a great cost.I\n     therefore think that when regular forces enter into a campaign\n     under these conditions, the former ought to avoid any unnecessary\n     haste, for time does not press with them, while every day\n     increases the burden on a country without resources and\n     unaccustomed to discipline, and as the forces of the country,\n     unprovided with artillery, never ought to be able to attack\n     fortified posts, any advance should be made by the establishment\n     of such posts.All engagements in the field ought, if possible,\n     to be avoided, except by corps raised from people who in their\n     habits resemble those in arms, or else by irregular corps raised\n     for the purpose, apart from the routine and red-tape inseparable\n     from regular armies.The regular forces will act as the back-bone\n     of the expedition, but the rock and cover fighting will be done\n     better by levies of such specially raised irregulars.For war\n     with native countries, I think that, except for the defence of\n     posts, artillery is a great incumbrance, far beyond its value.It\n     is a continual source of anxiety.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.Its transport regulates the\n     speed of the march, and it forms a target for the enemy, while\n     its effects on the scattered enemy is almost _nil_.An advance of\n     regular troops, as at present organised, is just the sort of\n     march that suits an active native foe.The regulars' column must\n     be heaped together, covering its transport and artillery.The\n     enemy knows the probable point of its destination on a particular\n     day, and then, knowing that the regulars cannot halt definitely\n     where it may be chosen to attack, it hovers round the column like\n     wasps.The regulars cannot, from not being accustomed to the\n     work, go clambering over rocks, or beating covers after their\n     foes.Therefore I conclude that in these wars[1] regular troops\n     should only act as a reserve; that the real fighting should be\n     done either by native allies or by special irregular corps,\n     commanded by special men, who would be untrammelled by\n     regulations; that, except for the defence of posts, artillery\n     should be abandoned.It may seem egotistical, but I may state\n     that I should never have succeeded against native foes had I not\n     had flanks, and front, and rear covered by irregular forces.Whenever either the flanks, or rear, or front auxiliaries were\n     barred in their advance, we turned the regular forces on that\n     point, and thus strengthening the hindered auxiliaries, drove\n     back the enemy.We owed defeats, when they occurred, to the\n     absence of these auxiliaries, and on two occasions to having\n     cannon with the troops, which lost us 1600 men.The Abyssinians,\n     who are the best of mountaineers, though they have them, utterly\n     despise cannon, as they hinder their movements.I could give\n     instance after instance where, in native wars, regular troops\n     could not hold their own against an active guerilla, and where,\n     in some cases, the disasters of the regulars were brought about\n     by being hampered by cannon.No one can deny artillery may be\n     most efficient in the contention of two regular armies, but it is\n     quite the reverse in guerilla warfare.The inordinate haste which\n     exists to finish off these wars throws away many valuable aids\n     which would inevitably accrue to the regular army if time was\n     taken to do the work, and far greater expense is caused by this\n     hurry than otherwise would be necessary.All is done on the\n     '_Veni, vidi, vici_' principle.It may be very fine, but it is\n     bloody and expensive, and not scientific.I am sure it will occur\n     to many, the times we have advanced, without proper breaches,\n     bridges, etc., and with what loss, assaulted.It would seem that\n     military science should be entirely thrown away when combating\n     native tribes.I think I am correct in saying that the Romans\n     always fought with large auxiliary forces of the invaded country\n     or its neighbours, and I know it was the rule of the Russians in\n     Circassia.\"[1] In allusion more particularly to the Cape and China.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.Perhaps Gordon was influenced by the catastrophes in South Africa when\nhe sent the following telegram at his own expense to the Cape\nauthorities on 7th April 1881: \"Gordon offers his services for two\nyears at L700 per annum to assist in terminating war and administering\nBasutoland.\"To this telegram he was never accorded even the courtesy\nof a negative reply.It will be remembered that twelve months earlier\nthe Cape Government had offered him the command of the forces, and\nthat his reply had been to refuse.The incident is of some interest as\nshowing that his attention had been directed to the Basuto question,\nand also that he was again anxious for active employment.His wish for\nthe latter was to be realised in an unexpected manner.He was staying in London when, on visiting the War Office, he casually\nmet the late Colonel Sir Howard Elphinstone, an officer of his own\ncorps, who began by complaining of his hard luck in its just having\nfallen to his turn to fill the post of Engineer officer in command at\nthe Mauritius, and such was the distastefulness of the prospect of\nservice in such a remote and unattractive spot, that Sir Howard went\non to say that he thought he would sooner retire from the service.In\nhis impulsive manner Gordon at once exclaimed: \"Oh, don't worry\nyourself, I will go for you; Mauritius is as good for me as anywhere\nelse.\"The exact manner in which this exchange was brought about has\nbeen variously described, but this is the literal version given me by\nGeneral Gordon himself, and there is no doubt that, as far as he could\nregret anything that had happened, he bitterly regretted the accident\nthat caused him to become acquainted with the Mauritius.In a letter\nto myself on the subject from Port Louis he said: \"It was not over\ncheerful to go out to this place, nor is it so to find a deadly sleep\nover all my military friends here.\"In making the arrangements which\nwere necessary to effect the official substitution of himself for\nColonel Elphinstone, Gordon insisted on only two points: first, that\nElphinstone should himself arrange the exchange; and secondly that no\npayment was to be made to him as was usual--in this case about\nL800--on an exchange being effected.Sir Howard Elphinstone was thus\nsaved by Gordon's peculiarities a disagreeable experience and a\nconsiderable sum of money.Some years after Gordon's death Sir Howard\nmet with a tragic fate, being washed overboard while taking a trip\nduring illness to Madeira.Like everything else he undertook, Gordon determined to make his\nMauritius appointment a reality, and although he was only in the\nisland twelve months, and during that period took a trip to the\ninteresting group of the Seychelles, he managed to compress an immense\namount of work into that short space, and to leave on record some\nvaluable reports on matters of high importance.He found at Mauritius\nthe same dislike for posts that were outside the ken of headquarters,\nand the same indifference to the dry details of professional work that\ndrove officers of high ability and attainments to think of resigning\nthe service sooner than fill them, and, when they did take them, to\npass their period of exile away from the charms of Pall Mall in a\nstate of inaction that verged on suspended animation.In a passage\nalready quoted, he refers to the deadly sleep of his military friends,\nand then he goes on to say in a sentence, which cannot be too much\ntaken to heart by those who have to support this mighty empire, with\nenemies on every hand--\"We are in a perfect Fools' Paradise about our\npower.We have plenty of power if we would pay attention to our work,\nbut the fault is, to my mind, the military power of the country is\neaten up by selfishness and idleness, and we are trading on the\nreputation of our forefathers.When one sees by the newspapers the\nEmperor of Germany sitting, old as he is, for two long hours\ninspecting his troops, and officers here grudging two hours a week for\ntheir duties, one has reason to fear the future.\"During his stay at Mauritius he wrote three papers of first-rate\nimportance.One of them on Egyptian affairs after the deposition of\nIsmail may be left for the next chapter, and the two others, one on\ncoaling stations in the Indian Ocean, and the second on the\ncomparative merits of the Cape and Mediterranean routes come within\nthe scope of this chapter, and are, moreover, deserving of special\nconsideration.With regard to the former of these two important\nsubjects, Gordon wrote as follows, but I cannot discover that anything\nhas been done to give practical effect to his recommendations:--\n\n     \"I spoke to you concerning Borneo and the necessity for coaling\n     stations in the Eastern seas.After holes had been pounded through the wall in\nmany places large blocks of brick-and-mortar commenced to fall out, and\nthen portions of the wall came down bodily, leaving wide gaps.Thereupon\na sergeant of the Fifty-Third, who had served under Sir Colin Campbell\nin the Punjab, presuming on old acquaintance, called out: \"Sir Colin,\nyour Excellency, let the infantry storm; let the two 'Thirds' at them\n[meaning the Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third], and we'll soon make short\nwork of the murdering villains!\"The sergeant who called to Sir Colin\nwas a Welshman, and I recognised him thirty-five years afterwards as old\nJoe Lee, the present proprietor of the Railway Hotel in Cawnpore.He was\nalways known as Dobbin in his regiment; and Sir Colin, who had a most\nwonderful memory for names and faces, turning to General Sir William\nMansfield who had formerly served in the Fifty-Third, said, \"Isn't that\nSergeant Dobbin?\"General Mansfield replied in the affirmative; and Sir\nColin, turning to Lee, said, \"Do you think the breach is wide enough,\nDobbin?\"Lee replied, \"Part of us can get through and hold it till the\npioneers widen it with their crowbars to allow the rest to get in.\"The\nword was then passed to the Fourth Punjabis to prepare to lead the\nassault, and after a few more rounds were fired, the charge was ordered.The Punjabis dashed over the mud wall shouting the war-cry of the Sikhs,\n\"_Jai Khalsa Jee_!\"[17] led by their two European officers, who were\nboth shot down before they had gone a few yards.This staggered the\nSikhs, and they halted.As soon as Sir Colin saw them waver, he turned\nto Colonel Ewart, who was in command of the seven companies of the\nNinety-Third (Colonel Leith-Hay being in command of the assault on the\nThirty-Second barracks), and said: \"Colonel Ewart, bring on the\ntartan--let my own lads at them.\"Before the command could be repeated\nor the buglers had time to sound the advance, the whole seven companies,\nlike one man, leaped over the wall, with such a yell of pent-up rage as\nI had never heard before nor since.It was not a cheer, but a\nconcentrated yell of rage and ferocity that made the echoes ring again;\nand it must have struck terror into the defenders, for they actually\nceased firing, and we could see them through the breach rushing from the\noutside wall to take shelter in the two-storied building in the centre\nof the garden, the gate and doors of which they firmly barred.Here I\nmust not omit to pay a tribute of respect to the memory of Pipe-Major\nJohn M'Leod, who, with seven pipers, the other three being with their\ncompanies attacking the barracks, struck up the Highland Charge, called\nby some _The Haughs of Cromdell_, and by others _On wi' the Tartan_--the\nfamous charge of the great Montrose when he led his Highlanders so often\nto victory.When all was over, and Sir Colin complimented the pipe-major\non the way he had played, John said, \"I thought the boys would fecht\nbetter wi' the national music to cheer them.\"The storming of the Secundrabagh has been so often described that I need\nnot dwell on the general action.Once inside, the Fifty-Third (who got\nin by a window or small door in the wall to the right of the hole by\nwhich we got through) and the Sikhs who followed us, joined the\nNinety-Third, and keeping together the bayonet did the work.As I before\nremarked, I could write pages about the actions of individual men whose\nnames will never be known to history.Although pressed for space, I\nmust notice the behaviour of one or two.But I must leave this to\nanother chapter; the present one has already become too long.With regard to the incident mentioned on page 40 Captain W.\n      T. Furse, A.D.C.to his Excellency, wrote to me as follows:\n      \"Dear Forbes-Mitchell--His Excellency has read your Mutiny\n      Reminiscences with great interest, and thinks they are a\n      very true description of the events of that time.He wishes\n      me, however, to draw your attention to a mistake you have\n      made in stating that 'the horse of Lieutenant Roberts was\n      shot down under him.'But the Chief remembers that though he\n      was in the position which you assign to him at that moment,\n      it was not his horse that was shot, but the horse of a\n      trooper of the squadron commanded by Lieut.J. Watson (now\n      Sir John Watson, V.C., K.C.B.), who happened to be near Lord\n      Roberts at the time.\"Now I could not understand this, because I had entered in my\n      note-book that Lieutenant Fred.Roberts, Deputy Assistant\n      Quartermaster-General of Artillery, was the first man to\n      enter the Dilkoosha park and ride to the front to\n      reconnoitre, that the enemy opened fire on him at\n      point-blank range from a masked battery of 9-pounder guns,\n      and that his horse was shot under him near the Yellow\n      Bungalow (the name by which we then knew the Dilkoosha\n      palace) on the morning of the 14th of November, 1857.And I\n      was confident that about half-a-dozen men with Captain\n      Dalziel ran out from the light company of the Ninety-Third\n      to go to the assistance of Lieutenant Roberts, when we all\n      saw him get on his feet and remount what we believed was a\n      spare horse.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.The men of the light company, seeing that their\n      assistance was not required, returned to the line, and\n      directly we saw Lieutenant Roberts in the saddle again,\n      unhurt, the whole regiment, officers and men, gave him a\n      hearty cheer.But here was the Commander-in-Chief, through\n      his aide-de-camp, telling me that I was incorrect!I could\n      not account for it till I obtained an interview with his\n      Excellency, when he explained to me that after he went past\n      the Ninety-Third through the breach in the wall of the\n      Dilkoosha park, Lieutenant Watson sent a trooper after him,\n      and that the trooper was close to him when the battery\n      unmasked and opened fire on them, the guns having been laid\n      for their horses; that the second shot struck the trooper's\n      horse as described by me, the horse and rider falling\n      together amidst the dust knocked up by the other round shot;\n      and that he, as a matter of course, dismounted and assisted\n      the trooper to get from under the dead horse, and as he\n      remounted after performing this humane and dangerous service\n      to the fallen trooper, the Ninety-Third set up their cheer\n      as I described.Now I must say the true facts of this incident rather add to\n      the bravery of the action.The young lieutenant, who could\n      thus coolly dismount and extricate a trooper from under a\n      dead horse within point-blank range of a well-served battery\n      of 9-pounder guns, was early qualifying for the\n      distinguished position which he has since reached.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[6] Unleavened griddle-cakes.[9] The native official in charge of the bazaar;

it added to the _esprit de corps_ which\nwas already a prominent feeling in the regiment, and enabled the boys to\nboast to the girls in Portsmouth that they were \"a cut above\" the other\ncorps of the army.In support of this, the fact is worthy of being put\non record that although the regiment was not (as is usually the case)\nconfined to barracks the night before embarking, but were allowed leave\ntill midnight, still, when the time to leave the barracks came, there\nwas not a single man absent nor a prisoner in the guard-room; and\nGeneral Britain put it in garrison orders that he had never been able\nto say the same of any other corps during the time he had commanded the\nPortsmouth garrison.But the Ninety-Third were no ordinary regiment.They were then the most Scotch of all the Highland regiments; in brief,\nthey were a military Highland parish, minister and elders complete.The\nelders were selected from among the men of all ranks,--two sergeants,\ntwo corporals, and two privates; and I believe it was the only regiment\nin the army which had a regular service of Communion plate; and in time\nof peace the Holy Communion, according to the Church of Scotland, was\nadministered by the regimental chaplain twice a year.I hope the young\nsecond battalion of the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders are like the\nold Ninety-Third in this respect.At the same time, I don't ask them\never to pray for the men who took away the numbers from our regiments;\nmay their beards be defiled, is the only feeling I have for them.By\ntaking away the old numbers a great deal was lost, and as far as I can\nsee nothing has been gained except confusion and the utter effacement of\nall the old traditions of the army.The old numbers could easily have\nbeen retained along with the territorial designations.I hope at all\nevents that the present regiment will never forget they are the\ndescendants of the old Ninety-Third, the \"Thin Red Line\" which Sir Colin\nCampbell disdained to form four deep to meet the Russian cavalry on the\nmorning of the memorable 25th of October, 1854:--\"Steady, Ninety-Third,\nkeep steady!But I am describing the relief of Lucknow, not the \"Thin Red\nLine\" of Balaclava.Among the volunteers who came from the Seventy-Second was a man named\nJames Wallace.He and six others from the same regiment joined my\ncompany.Wallace was not his real name, but he never took any one into\nhis confidence, nor was he ever known to have any correspondence.He\nneither wrote nor received any letters, and he was usually so taciturn\nin his manner that he was known in the company as the Quaker, a name\nwhich had followed him from the Seventy-Second.He had evidently\nreceived a superior education, for if asked for any information by a\nmore ignorant comrade, he would at once give it; or questioned as to the\ntranslation of a Latin or French quotation in a book, he would give it\nwithout the least hesitation.I have often seen him on the voyage out\nwalking up and down the deck of the _Belleisle_ during the watches of\nthe night, repeating the famous poem of Lamartine, _Le Chien du\nSolitaire_, commencing:\n\n    Helas!rentrer tout seul dans sa maison deserte\n    Sans voir a votre approche une fenetre ouverte.Taking him all in all Quaker Wallace was a strange enigma which no one\ncould solve.When pressed to take promotion, for which his superior\neducation well fitted him, he absolutely refused, always saying that he\nhad come to the Ninety-Third for a certain purpose, and when that\npurpose was accomplished, he only wished to die\n\n    With his back to the field, and his feet to the foe!And leaving in battle no blot on his name,\n    Look proudly to Heaven from the death-bed of fame.During the march to Lucknow it was a common thing to hear the men in my\ncompany say they would give a day's grog to see Quaker Wallace under\nfire; and the time had now come for their gratification.There was another man in the company who had joined the regiment in\nTurkey before embarking for the Crimea.He was also a man of superior\neducation, but in many respects the very antithesis of Wallace.He was\nboth wild and reckless, and used often to receive money sent to him from\nsome one, which he as regularly spent in drink.He went under the name\nof Hope, but that was also known to be an assumed name, and when the\nvolunteers from the Seventy-Second joined the regiment in Dover, it was\nremarked that Wallace had the address of Hope, and had asked to be\nposted to the same company.Yet the two men never spoke to one another;\non the contrary they evidently hated each other with a mortal hatred.If\nthe history of these two men could be known it would without doubt form\nmaterial for a most sensational novel.Just about the time the men were tightening their belts and preparing\nfor the dash on the breach of the Secundrabagh, this man Hope commenced\nto curse and swear in such a manner that Captain Dawson, who commanded\nthe company, checked him, telling him that oaths and foul language were\nno signs of bravery.Hope replied that he did not care a d---- what the\ncaptain thought; that he would defy death; that the bullet was not yet\nmoulded that would kill him; and he commenced exposing himself above the\nmud wall behind which we were lying.The captain was just on the point\nof ordering a corporal and a file of men to take Hope to the rear-guard\nas drunk and riotous in presence of the enemy, when Pipe-Major John\nM'Leod, who was close to the captain, said: \"Don't mind the puir lad,\nsir; he's not drunk, he is fey!It's not himself\nthat's speaking; he will never see the sun set.\"The words were barely\nout of the pipe-major's mouth when Hope sprang up on the top of the mud\nwall, and a bullet struck him on the right side, hitting the buckle of\nhis purse belt, which diverted its course, and instead of going right\nthrough his body it cut him round the front of his belly below the\nwaist-belt, making a deep wound, and his bowels burst out falling down\nto his knees.He sank down at once, gasping for breath, when a couple of\nbullets went through his chest and he died without a groan.John M'Leod\nturned and said to Captain Dawson, \"I told you so, sir.I am never deceived in a fey man!It was not himself who spoke when\nswearing in yon terrible manner.\"Just at this time Quaker Wallace, who\nhad evidently been a witness of Hope's tragic end, worked his way along\nto where the dead man lay, and looking on the distorted features he\nsolemnly said, \"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord._I came to the\nNinety-Third to see that man die!_\" All this happened only a few seconds\nbefore the assault was ordered, and attracted but little attention\nexcept from those who were immediate witnesses of the incident.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.The\ngunners were falling fast, and almost all eyes were turned on them and\nthe breach.When the signal for the assault was given, Quaker Wallace\nwent into the Secundrabagh like one of the Furies, if there are male\nFuries, plainly seeking death but not meeting it, and quoting the 116th\nPsalm, Scotch version in metre, beginning at the first verse:\n\n    I love the Lord, because my voice\n      And prayers He did hear.I, while I live, will call on Him,\n      Who bow'd to me His ear.And thus he plunged into the Secundrabagh quoting the next verse at\nevery shot fired from his rifle and at each thrust given by his bayonet:\n\n    I'll of salvation take the cup,\n      On God's name will I call;\n    I'll pay my vows now to the Lord\n      Before His people all.It was generally reported in the company that Quaker Wallace\nsingle-handed killed twenty men, and one wonders at this, remembering\nthat he took no comrade with him and did not follow Sir Colin's rule of\n\"fighting in threes,\" but whenever he saw an enemy he \"went for\" him!I\nmay here remark that the case of Wallace proved that, in a fight like\nthe Secundrabagh where the enemy is met hand to hand and foot to foot,\nthe way to escape death is to brave it.Of course Wallace might have\nbeen shot from a distance, and in that respect he only ran an even\nchance with the others; but wherever he rushed with his bayonet, the\nenemy did their utmost to give him a wide berth.By the time the bayonet had done its work of retribution, the throats of\nour men were hoarse with shouting \"Cawnpore!The\ntaste of the powder (those were the days when the muzzle-loading\ncartridges had to be bitten with the teeth) made men almost mad with\nthirst; and with the sun high over head, and being fresh from England,\nwith our feather bonnets, red coats, and heavy kilts, we felt the heat\nintensely.In the centre of the inner court of the Secundrabagh there was a large\n_peepul_[18] tree with a very bushy top, round the foot of which were\nset a number of jars full of cool water.When the slaughter was almost\nover, many of our men went under the tree for the sake of its shade, and\nto quench their burning thirst with a draught of the cool water from the\njars.A number however lay dead under this tree, both of the Fifty-Third\nand Ninety-Third, and the many bodies lying in that particular spot\nattracted the notice of Captain Dawson.After having carefully examined\nthe wounds, he noticed that in every case the men had evidently been\nshot from above.He thereupon stepped out from beneath the tree, and\ncalled to Quaker Wallace to look up if he could see any one in the top\nof the tree, because all the dead under it had apparently been shot from\nabove.Wallace had his rifle loaded, and stepping back he carefully\nscanned the top of the tree.He almost immediately called out, \"I see\nhim, sir!\"and cocking his rifle he repeated aloud,\n\n    I'll pay my vows now to the Lord\n      Before His people all.He fired, and down fell a body dressed in a tight-fitting red jacket and\ntight-fitting rose- silk trousers; and the breast of the jacket\nbursting open with the fall, showed that the wearer was a woman, She was\narmed with a pair of heavy old-pattern cavalry pistols, one of which was\nin her belt still loaded, and her pouch was still about half full of\nammunition, while from her perch in the tree, which had been carefully\nprepared before the attack, she had killed more than half-a-dozen men.When Wallace saw that the person whom he shot was a woman, he burst into\ntears, exclaiming: \"If I had known it was a woman, I would rather have\ndied a thousand deaths than have harmed her.\"I cannot now recall, although he belonged to my company, what became of\nQuaker Wallace, whether he lived to go through the rest of the Mutiny or\nnot.I have long since lost my pocket company-roll, but I think Wallace\ntook sick and was sent to Allahabad from Cawnpore, and was either\ninvalided to England or died in the country.By this time all opposition had ceased, and over two thousand of the\nenemy lay dead within the building and the centre court.The troops were\nwithdrawn, and the muster-roll of the Ninety-Third was called just\noutside the gate, which is still standing, on the level spot between the\ngate and the mound where the European dead are buried.When the roll was called it was found that the Ninety-Third had nine\nofficers and ninety-nine men, in all one hundred and eight, killed and\nwounded.The roll of the Fifty-Third was called alongside of us, and Sir\nColin Campbell rode up and addressing the men, spoke out in a clear\nvoice: \"Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third, you have bravely done your share\nof this morning's work, and Cawnpore is avenged!\"Whereupon one of the\nFifty-Third sang out, \"Three cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys,\"\nwhich was heartily responded to.All this time there was perfect silence around us, the enemy evidently\nnot being aware of how the tide of victory had rolled inside the\nSecundrabagh, for not a soul escaped from it to tell the tale.The\nsilence was so great that we could hear the pipers of the Seventy-Eighth\nplaying inside the Residency as a welcome to cheer us all.There were\nlately, by the way, some writers who denied that the Seventy-Eighth had\ntheir bagpipes and pipers with them at Lucknow.This is not true; they\nhad their pipes and played them too!But we had barely saluted the\nCommander-in-Chief with a cheer when a perfect hail of round-shot\nassailed us both from the Tara Kothi on our left and the Shah Nujeef on\nour right front.But I must leave the account of our storming the Shah\nNujeef for a separate chapter.I may here remark that on revisiting Lucknow I did not see a single\ntablet or grave to show that any of the Ninety-Third are buried there.Surely Captains Dalzell and Lumsden and the men who lie in the mound to\nthe east of the gate of the Secundrabagh are deserving of some memorial!But it is the old, old story which was said to have been first written\non the walls of Badajoz:\n\n    When war is rife and danger nigh,\n    God and the Soldier is all the cry;", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "I am surprised that the officers of the Ninety-Third Regiment have never\ntaken any steps to erect some monument to the memory of the brave men\nwho fell in Lucknow at its relief, and at the siege in March, 1858.Neither is there a single tablet in the Memorial Church at Cawnpore in\nmemory of the Ninety-Third, although almost every one of the other\nregiments have tablets somewhere in the church.If I were a millionaire\nI would myself erect a statue to Sir Colin Campbell on the spot where\nthe muster-roll of the Ninety-Third was called on the east of the gate\nof the Secundrabagh, with a life-sized figure of a private of the\nFifty-Third and Ninety-Third, a sailor and a Sikh at each corner, with\nthe names of every man who fell in the assault on the 16th of November,\n1857; and as the Royal Artillery were also there, Sir Colin should be\nrepresented in the centre standing on a gun, with a royal artilleryman\nholding a port-fire ready.Since commencing these reminiscences I met a gentleman in Calcutta who\ntold me that he had a cousin in the Ninety-Third, General J. A. Ewart,\nwho was with the regiment in the storming of the Secundrabagh, and he\nasked me if I remembered General Ewart.This leads me to believe that it\nwould not be out of place if I were to relate the following narrative.General Ewart, now Sir John Alexander Ewart, I am informed, is still\nalive, and some mention of the part played by him, so far as I saw it,\nwill form an appropriate conclusion to the story of the taking of the\nSecundrabagh.And should he ever read this narrative, I may inform him\nthat it is written by one who was present when he was adopted into the\nClan Forbes by our chief, the late Sir Charles Forbes, of Newe and\nEdinglassie, Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, and this fact alone will make the\ngeneral receive my remarks with the feelings of a clansman as well as of\nmy old commander.The reminiscence of Secundrabagh which is here reproduced was called\nforth, I should state, by a paragraph which appeared at the time in the\ncolumns of _The Calcutta Statesman_ regarding General Ewart.The\nparagraph was as follows:\n\n      General Ewart, not having been employed since he gave over\n      the command of the Allahabad division on the 30th of\n      November, 1879, was placed on the retired list on the 30th\n      ultimo [Nov.General Ewart is one of the few, if not\n      the only general, who refused a transfer from the Allahabad\n      Command to a more favourite division.He has served for over\n      forty-six years, but has only been employed once since\n      giving over the command of the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders in\n      1864, and that was for two and a half years in this country.He commanded the Ninety-Third for about eighteen months\n      before joining the Seventy-Eighth.He is in possession of\n      the Crimean medal with four clasps, a novelty rather\n      nowadays.He lost his left arm at the battle of Cawnpore.I accordingly wrote to _The Statesman_ desiring to correct a slight\ninaccuracy in the statement that \"General Ewart commanded the\nNinety-Third for about eighteen months before joining the\nSeventy-Eighth.\"This is not, I remarked, strictly correct; General\nEwart never commanded the Ninety-Third in the sense implied.He joined\nthe regiment as captain in 1848, exchanging from the old Thirty-Fifth\nRoyal Sussex with Captain Buchanan of the Ninety-Third, and served in\nthe regiment till he received the regimental rank of lieutenant-colonel\non the death, at Fort Rooyah in April, 1858, of the Hon.Colonel Ewart was then in England on sick-leave, suffering from the loss\nof his arm and other wounds and exchanged into the Seventy-Eighth with\nColonel Stisted about the end of 1859, so that he never actually\ncommanded the Ninety-Third for more than a few days at most.I will now\ngive a few facts about him which may interest old soldiers at least.During the whole of his service in the Ninety-Third, both as captain\nand field-officer, Colonel Ewart was singularly devoted to duty, while\ncareful, considerate, and attentive to the wants of his men in a way\nthat made him more beloved by those under his command than any officer I\never met during my service in the army.To the best of my recollection,\nhe was the only officer of the Ninety-Third who received the clasp for\nInkerman.At that battle he was serving on the staff of Lord Raglan as\nDeputy-Assistant-Quartermaster-General, and as such was on duty on the\nmorning of the battle, and I believe he was the first officer of the\nBritish army who perceived the Russian advance.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.He was visiting the\noutposts, as was his custom when on duty, in the early morning, and gave\nthe alarm to Sir George Brown's division, and then carried the news of\nthe attack to Lord Raglan.For his services at Inkerman he was promoted\nbrevet lieutenant-colonel, and on the termination of the war, besides\nthe Crimean medal with four clasps (Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and\nSebastopol), he received the Cross of the Legion of Honour and the\nSardinian Medal, with the motto _Al valore Militare_, and also the\nTurkish Order of the Medjidie.Early in the attack on the Secundrabagh three companies of the\nNinety-Third were detached under Colonel Leith-Hay to clear the ground\nto the left and carry the barracks, and Colonel Ewart was left in\ncommand of the other seven companies.For some time we lay down\nsheltered by a low mud wall not more than one hundred and fifty to two\nhundred yards from the walls of the Secundrabagh, to allow time for the\nheavy guns to breach the garden wall.During this time Colonel Ewart had\ndismounted and stood exposed on the bank, picking off the enemy on the\ntop of the building with one of the men's rifles which he took, making\nthe owner of the rifle lie down.The artillerymen were falling fast, but, after\na few discharges, a hole,--it could not be called a breach--was made,\nand the order was given to the Fourth Punjab Rifles to storm.They\nsprang out of cover, as I have already described, but before they were\nhalf-way across the intervening distance, their commanding officer fell\nmortally wounded, and I think two others of their European officers were\nseverely wounded.This caused a slight halt of the Punjabis.Sir Colin\ncalled to Colonel Ewart, \"Ewart, bring on the tartan;\" one of our\nbuglers who was in attendance on Sir Colin, sounded the _advance_, and\nthe whole of the Ninety-Third dashed from behind the bank.It has always\nbeen a disputed point who got through the hole first.I believe the\nfirst man in was Lance-Corporal Donnelly of the Ninety-Third, who was\nkilled inside; then Subadar Gokul Sing, followed by Sergeant-Major\nMurray, of the Ninety-Third, also killed, and fourth, Captain Burroughs,\nseverely wounded.It was about this time I got through myself, pushed up by Colonel Ewart\nwho immediately followed.My feet had scarcely touched the ground\ninside, when a sepoy fired point-blank at me from among the long grass\na few yards distant.The bullet struck the thick brass clasp of my\nwaist-belt, but with such force that it sent me spinning heels over\nhead.The man who fired was cut down by Captain Cooper, of the\nNinety-Third, who got through the hole abreast with myself.When struck\nI felt just as one feels when tripped up at a football match.Before I\nregained my feet, I heard Ewart say as he rushed past me, \"Poor fellow,\nhe is done for.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.I was but stunned, and regaining my feet and my breath\ntoo, which was completely knocked out of me, I rushed on to the inner\ncourt of the building, where I saw Ewart bareheaded, his feather bonnet\nhaving been shot off his head, engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fight with\nseveral of the enemy.I believe he shot down five or six of them with\nhis revolver.By that time the whole of the Ninety-Third and the Sikhs\nhad got in either through the wall or by the principal gate which had\nnow been forced open; the Fifty-Third, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon\nof the Ninety-Third, and Captain B. Walton (who was severely wounded),\nhad got in by a window in the right angle of the garden wall which they\nforced open.The inner court was rapidly filled with dead, but two\nofficers of the mutineers were fiercely defending a regimental colour\ninside a dark room.Ewart rushed on them to seize it, and although\nseverely wounded in his sword-arm, he not only captured the colour, but\nkilled both the officers who were defending it.A few only of the defenders\nof the Secundrabagh were left alive, and those few were being hunted\nout of dark corners, some of them from below heaps of slain.Colonel\nEwart, seeing that the fighting was over, started with his colour to\npresent it to Sir Colin Campbell; but whether it was that the old Chief\nconsidered that it was _infra dig_.for a field-officer to expose\nhimself to needless danger, or whether it was that he was angry at some\nother thing, I know not, but this much I remember: Colonel Ewart ran up\nto him where he sat on his gray charger outside the gate of the\nSecundrabagh, and called out: \"We are in possession of the bungalows,\nsir.I have killed the last two of the enemy with my own hand, and here\nis one of their colours,\" \"D--n your colours, sir!\"\"It's not your place to be taking colours; go back to your regiment this\ninstant, sir!\"However, the officers of the staff who were with Sir\nColin gave a cheer for Colonel Ewart, and one of them presented him with\na cap to cover his head, which was still bare.He turned back,\napparently very much upset at the reception given to him by the old\nChief; but I afterwards heard that Sir Colin sent for him in the\nafternoon, apologised for his rudeness, and thanked him for his\nservices.Before I conclude, I may remark that I have often thought over\nthis incident, and the more I think of it, the more I am convinced that,\nfrom the wild and excited appearance of Colonel Ewart, who had been by\nthat time more than an hour without his hat in the fierce rays of the\nsun, covered with blood and powder smoke, and his eyes still flashing\nwith the excitement of the fight, giving him the appearance of a man\nunder the influence of something more potent than \"blue ribbon\"\ntipple--I feel pretty sure, I say, that, when Sir Colin first saw him,\nhe thought he was drunk.When he found out his mistake he was of course\nsorry for his rudeness.After the capture of the Shah Nujeef, a field officer was required to\nhold the barracks, which was one of the most important posts on our left\nadvance, and although severely wounded, having several sabre-cuts and\nmany bruises on his body, Colonel Ewart volunteered for the post of\ncommandant of the force.This post he held until the night of the\nevacuation of the Residency and the retreat from Lucknow, for the\npurpose of relieving Cawnpore for the second time from the grasp of the\nNana Sahib and the Gwalior Contingent.It was at the retaking of\nCawnpore that Colonel Ewart eventually had his arm carried off by a\ncannon-shot; and the last time I saw him was when I assisted to lift him\ninto a _dooly_ on the plain of Cawnpore on the 1st of December, 1857.But I must leave the retaking of Cawnpore to its proper place in these\nreminiscences, and resume my narrative of the capture of the\nSecundrabagh.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.I mentioned previously that the muster-rolls had scarcely been called\noutside the gateway, when the enemy evidently became aware that the\nplace was no longer held for them by living men, and a terrible fire was\nopened on us from both our right and left, as well as from the Shah\nNujeef in our direct front.Let me here mention, before I take leave of the Secundrabagh, that I\nhave often been told that the hole in the wall by which the Ninety-Third\nentered is still in existence.This I had heard from several sources,\nand on Sunday morning, the 21st of August, 1892, when revisiting\nLucknow, I left the Royal Hotel with a guide who did not know that I had\never seen Lucknow before, and who assured me that the breach had been\npreserved just as it was left on the 16th of November, 1857, after the\nNinety-Third had passed through it; and I had made up my mind to\nre-enter the Secundrabagh once again by the same old hole.On reaching\nthe gate I therefore made the _gharry_ stop, and walked round the\noutside of the wall to the hole; but as soon as I arrived at the spot I\nsaw that the gap pointed out to me as the one by which the Ninety-Third\nentered was a fraud, and I astonished the guide by refusing to pass\nthrough it.The hole now shown as the one by which we entered was made\nthrough the wall by an 18-pounder gun, which was brought from Cawnpore\nby Captain Blount's troop of Royal Horse-Artillery.This was about\ntwenty yards to the left of the real hole, and was made to enable a few\nmen to keep up a cross fire through it till the stormers could get\nfooting inside the actual breach.This post was held by Sergeant James\nMorrison and several sharp-shooters from my company, who, by direction\nof Sir Colin, made a rush on this hole before the order was given for\nthe Fourth Punjab Infantry to storm.Any military man of the least\nexperience seeing the hole and its size now, thirty-five years after\nthe event, will know this to be a fact.The real breach was much bigger\nand could admit three men abreast, and, as near as I can judge, was\nabout the centre of the road which now passes through the Secundrabagh.The guide, I may say, admitted such to be the case when he found that I\nhad seen the Secundrabagh before his time.Although it was only a hole,\nand not what is correctly called a breach, in the wall, it was so wide,\nand the surrounding parts of the wall had been so shaken by round-shot,\nthat the upper portion forming the arch must have fallen down within a\nfew years after 1857, and this evidently formed a convenient breach in\nthe wall through which the present road has been constructed.[19] The\nsmaller hole meanwhile has been laid hold of by the guides as the\nidentical passage by which the Secundrabagh was stormed.Having corrected the guide on this point, I will now give my\nrecollections of the assault on the Shah Nujeef, and the Kuddum Russool\nwhich stands on its right, advancing from the Secundrabagh.The Kuddum Russool was a strongly-built domed mosque not nearly so large\nas the Shah Nujeef, but it had been surrounded by a strong wall and\nconverted into a powder magazine by the English between the annexation\nof Lucknow and the outbreak of the Mutiny.I think this fact is\nmentioned by Mr.Gubbins in his _Mutinies in Oude_.The Kuddum Russool\nwas still used by the mutineers as a powder-magazine, but the powder had\nbeen conveyed from it into the tomb of the Shah Nujeef, when the latter\nwas converted into a post of defence to bar our advance on the\nResidency.Before the order was given for the attack on the Shah Nujeef, I may\nmention that the quartermaster-general's department had made an estimate\nof the number of the enemy slain in the Secundrabagh from their\nappearance and from their parade-states of that morning.The mutineers,\nlet me say, had still kept up their English discipline and parade-forms,\nand their parade-states and muster-rolls of the 16th of November were\ndiscovered among other documents in a room of the Secundrabagh which had\nbeen their general's quarters and orderly-room.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.It was then found that\nfour separate regiments had occupied the Secundrabagh, numbering about\ntwo thousand five hundred men, and these had been augmented by a number\nof _budmashes_ from the city, bringing up the list of actual slain in\nthe house and garden to about three thousand.Of these, over two\nthousand lay dead inside the rooms of the main building and the inner\ncourt.The colours, drums, etc., of the Seventy-First Native Infantry\nand the Eleventh Oude Irregular Infantry were captured.The mutineers\nfought under their English colours, and there were several Mahommedan\nstandards of green silk captured besides the English colours.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.The\nSeventy-First Native Infantry was one of the crack corps of the\nCompany's army, and many of the men were wearing the Punjab medals on\ntheir breasts.This regiment and the Eleventh Oude Irregulars were\nsimply annihilated.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.On examining the bodies of the dead, over fifty men\nof the Seventy-First were found to have furloughs, or leave-certificates,\nsigned by their former commanding officer in their pockets, showing that\nthey had been on leave when their regiment mutinied and had rejoined\ntheir colours to fight against us.It is a curious fact that after the\nMutiny was suppressed, many sepoys tendered these leave-certificates as\nproof that they had _not_ taken part in the rebellion; and I believe all\nsuch got enrolled either in the police or in the new regiments that were\nbeing raised, and obtained their back pay.And doubtless if the\nNinety-Third and Fifty-Third bayonets had not cancelled those of the\nSeventy-First Native Infantry all those _loyal_ men would afterwards\nhave presented their leave-certificates, and have claimed pay for the\ntime they were fighting against us!When the number of the slain was reported to Sir Colin, he turned to\nBrigadier Hope, and said \"This morning's work will strike terror into\nthe sepoys,--it will strike terror into them,\" and he repeated it\nseveral times.Then turning to us again he said: \"Ninety-Third, you have\nbravely done your share of this morning's work, and Cawnpore is avenged!There is more hard work to be done; but unless as a last resource, I\nwill not call on you to storm more positions to-day.Your duty will be\nto cover the guns after they are dragged into position.But, my boys,\nif need be, remember I depend on you to carry the next position in the\nsame daring manner in which you carried the Secundrabagh.\"With that\nsome one from the ranks called out, \"Will we get a medal for this, Sir\nColin?\"To which he replied: \"Well, my lads, I can't say what Her\nMajesty's Government may do; but if you don't get a medal, all I can say\nis you have deserved one better than any troops I have ever seen under\nfire.I shall inform the Governor-General, and, through him, Her Majesty\nthe Queen, that I have never seen troops behave better.\"The order was\nthen given to man the drag-ropes of Peel's guns for the advance on the\nShah Nujeef, and obeyed with a cheer; and, as it turned out, the\nNinety-Third had to storm that position also.The advance on the Shah Nujeef has been so often described that I will\ncut my recollections of it short.At the word of command Captain\nMiddleton's battery of Royal Artillery dashed forward with loud cheers,\nthe drivers waving their whips and the gunners their caps as they passed\nus and Peel's guns at the gallop.The 24-pounder guns meanwhile were\ndragged along by our men and the sailors in the teeth of a perfect hail\nof lead and iron from the enemy's batteries.In the middle of the march\na poor sailor lad, just in front of me, had his leg carried clean off\nabove the knee by a round-shot, and, although knocked head over heels by\nthe force of the shot, he sat bolt upright on the grass, with the blood\nspouting from the stump of his limb like water from the hose of a\nfire-engine, and shouted, \"Here goes a shilling a day, a shilling a day!<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Pitch into them, boys, pitch into them!Remember Cawnpore, Ninety-Third,\nremember Cawnpore!and he fell back in a dead\nfaint, and on we went.I afterwards heard that the poor fellow was dead\nbefore a doctor could reach the spot to bind up his limb.I will conclude this chapter with an extract from Sir Colin's despatch\non the advance on the Shah Nujeef:\n\n      The Ninety-Third and Captain Peel's guns rolled on in one\n      irresistible wave, the men falling fast, but the column\n      advanced till the heavy guns were within twenty yards of the\n      walls of the Shah Nujeef, where they were unlimbered and\n      poured in round after round against the massive walls of the\n      building, the withering fire of the Highlanders covering the\n      Naval Brigade from great loss.But it was an action almost\n      unexampled in war.Captain Peel behaved very much as if he\n      had been laying the _Shannon_ alongside an enemy's frigate.But in this despatch Sir Colin does not mention that he was himself\nwounded by a bullet after it had passed through the head of a\nNinety-Third grenadier.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[18] _Ficus Indica._\n\n[19] The author is quite right in this surmise; the road was made\nthrough the old breach in 1861.CHAPTER V\n\nPERSONAL ANECDOTES--CAPTURE OF THE SHAH NUJEEF--A FEARFUL EXPERIENCE\n\n\nI must now leave for a little the general struggle, and turn to the\nactions of individual men as they fell under my own observation,--actions\nwhich neither appear in despatches nor in history; and, by the way, I\nmay remark that one of the best accounts extant of the taking of the\nShah Nujeef is that of Colonel Alison, in _Blackwood's Magazine_ for\nOctober, 1858.Both the Alisons were severely wounded on that\noccasion,--Colonel Archibald Alison, Military Secretary, and his\nbrother, Captain F. M. Alison, A.D.C.I will now\nrelate a service rendered by Sergeant M. W. Findlay, of my company,\nwhich was never noticed nor rewarded.Sergeant Findlay, let me state,\nmerely considered that he had done his duty, but that is no reason why I\nshould not mention his name.I believe he is still in India, and a\ndistinguished officer of the Rajpootana-Malwa Railway Volunteers at\nAjmere.However, after Captain Peel's guns were dragged into position,\nthe Ninety-Third took up whatever shelter they could get on the right\nand left of the guns, and I, with several others, got behind the walls\nof an unroofed mud hut, through which we made loopholes on the side next\nto the Shah Nujeef, and were thus able to keep up a destructive fire\non the enemy.Let me add here that the surgeons of the force were\noverwhelmed with work, and attending to the wounded in the thick of the\nfire.Some time after the attack had commenced we noticed Captain Alison\nand his horse in a heap together a few yards behind where we were in\nshelter.Sergeant Findlay rushed out, got the wounded officer clear of\nhis dead horse under a perfect hail of bullets and round-shot, and\ncarried him under the shelter of the walls where we were lying.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.He then\nran off in search of a surgeon to bandage his wounds, which were\nbleeding very profusely; but the surgeons were all too busy, and Sir\nColin was most strict on the point of wounds being attended to.Officers, no matter what their rank, had no precedence over the\nrank-and-file in this respect; in fact, Sir Colin often expressed the\nopinion that an officer could be far more easily replaced than a\nwell-drilled private.However, there was no surgeon available; so\nSergeant Findlay took his own bandage,--every soldier on going on active\nservice is supplied with lint and a bandage to have them handy in case\nof wounds--set to work, stanched the bleeding, and bandaged up the\nwounds of Captain Alison in such a surgeon-like manner that, when Dr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.Menzies of the Ninety-Third at length came to see him, he thought he had\nbeen attended to by a doctor.When he did discover that it was Sergeant\nFindlay who had put on the bandages, he expressed his surprise, and said\nthat in all probability this prompt action had saved Captain Alison's\nlife, who otherwise might have been weakened by loss of blood beyond\nrecovery before a doctor could have attended to him.Menzies there\nand then applied to Captain Dawson to get Sergeant Findlay into the\nfield-hospital as an extra assistant to attend to the wounded.In\nclosing this incident I may remark that I have known men get the\nVictoria Cross for incurring far less danger than Sergeant Findlay did\nin exposing himself to bring Captain Alison under shelter.The bullets\nwere literally flying round him like hail; several passed through his\nclothes, and his feather bonnet was shot off his head.When he had\nfinished putting on the bandages he coolly remarked: \"I must go out and\nget my bonnet for fear I get sunstruck;\" so out he went for his hat, and\nbefore he got back scores of bullets were fired at him from the walls of\nthe Shah Nujeef.The next man I shall refer to was Sergeant Daniel White, one of the\ncoolest and most fearless men in the regiment.Sergeant White was a man\nof superior education, an excellent vocalist and reciter, with a most\nretentive memory, and one of the best amateur actors in the\nNinety-Third.Under fire he was just as cool and collected as if he had\nbeen enacting the part of Bailie Nicol Jarvie in _Rob Roy_.In the force defending the Shah Nujeef, in addition to the regular army,\nthere was a large body of archers on the walls, armed with bows and\narrows which they discharged with great force and precision, and on\nWhite raising his head above the wall an arrow was shot right into his\nfeather bonnet.Inside of the wire cage of his bonnet, however, he had\nplaced his forage cap, folded up, and instead of passing right through,\nthe arrow stuck in the folds of the forage cap, and \"Dan,\" as he was\ncalled, coolly pulled out the arrow, paraphrasing a quotation from Sir\nWalter Scott's _Legend of Montrose_, where Dugald Dalgetty and Ranald\nMacEagh made their escape from the castle of McCallum More.Looking at\nthe arrow, \"My conscience!\"Have we got Robin Hood and Little John back again?My conscience, the sight has not been seen in civilised war for\nnearly two hundred years.And why not weavers' beams as\nin the days of Goliath?that Daniel White should be able to tell in\nthe Saut Market of Glasgow that he had seen men fight with bows and\narrows in the days of Enfield rifles!Well, well, Jack Pandy, since bows\nand arrows are the words, here's at you!\"and with that he raised his\nfeather bonnet on the point of his bayonet above the top of the wall,\nand immediately another arrow pierced it through, while a dozen more\nwhizzed past a little wide of the mark.Just then one poor fellow of the Ninety-Third, named Penny, of No.2\ncompany, raising his head for an instant a little above the wall, got an\narrow right through his brain, the shaft projecting more than a foot out\nat the back of his head.As the poor lad fell dead at our feet,\nSergeant White remarked, \"Boys, this is no joke; we must pay them off.\"We all loaded and capped, and pushing up our feather bonnets again, a\nwhole shower of arrows went past or through them.Up we sprang and\nreturned a well-aimed volley from our rifles at point-blank distance,\nand more than half-a-dozen of the enemy went down.But one unfortunate\nman of the regiment, named Montgomery, of No.6 company, exposed himself\na little too long to watch the effect of our volley, and before he could\nget down into shelter again an arrow was sent right through his heart,\npassing clean through his body and falling on the ground a few yards\nbehind him.He leaped about six feet straight up in the air, and fell\nstone dead.White could not resist making another quotation, but this\ntime it was from the old English ballad of _Chevy Chase_.He had a bow bent in his hand\n      Made of a trusty tree,\n    An arrow of a cloth-yard long\n      Up to the head drew he.Against Sir Hugh Montgomerie\n      So right his shaft he set,\n    The grey goose wing that was thereon\n      In his heart's blood was wet.Readers who have never been under the excitement of a fight like this\nwhich I describe, may think that such coolness is an exaggeration.Remember the men of whom I write had stood in the \"Thin Red\nLine\" of Balaclava without wavering, and had made up their minds to die\nwhere they stood, if need be; men who had been for days and nights\nunder shot and shell in the trenches of Sebastopol.If familiarity\nbreeds contempt, continual exposure to danger breeds coolness, and, I\nmay say, selfishness too; where all are exposed to equal danger little\nsympathy is, for the time being at least, displayed for the unlucky ones\n\"knocked on the head,\" to use the common expression in the ranks for\nthose who are killed.Besides, Sergeant Daniel White was an\nexceptionally cool man, and looked on every incident with the eye of an\nactor.By this time the sun was getting low, a heavy cloud of smoke hung over\nthe field, and every flash of the guns and rifles could be clearly seen.The enemy in hundreds were visible on the ramparts, yelling like demons,\nbrandishing their swords in one hand and burning torches in the other,\nshouting at us to \"Come on!\"But little impression had been made on the\nsolid masonry walls.Brigadier Hope and his aide-de-camp were rolling on\nthe ground together, the horses of both shot dead; and the same shell\nwhich had done this mischief exploded one of our ammunition waggons,\nkilling and wounding several men.Altogether the position looked black\nand critical when Major Barnston and his battalion of detachments were\nordered to storm.This battalion of detachments was a body made up of\nalmost every corps in the service,--at least as far as the regiments\nforming the expedition to China were concerned--and men belonging to the\ndifferent corps which had entered the Residency with Generals Havelock\nand Outram.It also comprised some men who had been left (through\nsickness or wounds) at Allahabad and Cawnpore, and some of the Ninetieth\nRegiment which had been intercepted at Singapore on their way to China,\nunder Captain (now General Lord) Wolseley.However, although a made-up\nbattalion, they advanced bravely to the breach, and I think their\nleader, Major Barnston, was killed, and the command devolved on Captain\nWolseley.He made a most determined attempt to get into the place, but\nthere were no scaling-ladders, and the wall was still almost twenty feet\nhigh.During the heavy cannonade the masonry had fallen down in flakes\non the outside, but still leaving an inner wall standing almost\nperpendicular, and in attempting to climb up this the men were raked\nwith a perfect hail of missiles--grenades and round-shot hurled from\nwall-pieces, arrows and brickbats, burning torches of rags and cotton\nsaturated with oil--even boiling water was dashed on them!In the midst\nof the smoke the breach would have made a very good representation of\nPandemonium.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.There were scores of men armed with great burning torches\njust like what one may see in the sham fights of the _Mohurrum_, only\nthese men were in earnest, shouting \"_Allah Akbar!_\" \"_Deen!Deen!_\" and\n\"_Jai Kali ma ki!_\"[20]\n\nThe stormers were driven back, leaving many dead and wounded under the\nwall.At this juncture Sir Colin called on Brigadier Hope to form up\nthe Ninety-Third for a final attempt.Sir Colin, again addressing us,\nsaid that he had not intended to call on us to storm more positions that\nday, but that the building in our front must be carried before dark, and\nthe Ninety-Third must do it, and he would lead us himself, saying again:\n\"Remember, men, the lives at stake inside the Residency are those of\nwomen and children, and they must be rescued.\"A reply burst from the\nranks: \"Ay, ay, Sir Colin!we stood by you at Balaklava, and will stand\nby you here; but you must not expose yourself so much as you are doing.We can be replaced, but you can't.You must remain behind; we can lead\nourselves.\"By that time the battalion of detachments had cleared the front, and the\nenemy were still yelling to us to \"Come on,\" and piling up missiles to\ngive us a warm reception.Captain", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Just at that moment Sergeant John Paton of my company came running down\nthe ravine that separated the Kuddum Russool from the Shah Nujeef,\ncompletely out of breath through exertion, but just able to tell\nBrigadier Hope that he had gone up the ravine at the moment the\nbattalion of detachments had been ordered to storm, and had discovered a\nbreach in the north-east corner of the rampart next to the river\nGoomtee.It appears that our shot and shell had gone over the first\nbreach, and had blown out the wall on the other side in this particular\nspot.Paton told how he had climbed up to the top of the ramparts\nwithout difficulty, and seen right inside the place as the whole\ndefending force had been called forward to repulse the assault in front.Captain Dawson and his company were at once called out, and while the\nothers opened fire on the breach in front of them, we dashed down the\nravine, Sergeant Paton showing the way.As soon as the enemy saw that\nthe breach behind had been discovered, and that their well-defended\nposition was no longer tenable, they fled like sheep through the back\ngate next to the Goomtee and another in the direction of the Motee\nMunzil.7 company had got in behind them and cut off their\nretreat by the back gate, it would have been Secundrabagh over again!As\nit was, by the time we got over the breach we were able to catch only\nabout a score of the fugitives, who were promptly bayoneted; the rest\nfled pell-mell into the Goomtee, and it was then too dark to see to use\nthe rifle with effect on the flying masses.However, by the great pools\nof blood inside, and the number of dead floating in the river, they had\nplainly suffered heavily, and the well-contested position of the Shah\nNujeef was ours.By this time Sir Colin and those of his staff remaining alive or\nunwounded were inside the position, and the front gate thrown open.A\nhearty cheer was given for the Commander-in-Chief, as he called the\nofficers round him to give instructions for the disposition of the\nforce for the night.As it was Captain Dawson and his company who had\nscaled the breach, to them was assigned the honour of holding the Shah\nNujeef, which was now one of the principal positions to protect the\nretreat from the Residency.And thus ended the terrible 16th of\nNovember, 1857.In the taking of the Secundrabagh all the subaltern officers of my\ncompany were wounded, namely, Lieutenants E. Welch and S. E. Wood, and\nEnsign F. R. M'Namara.The only officer therefore with the company in\nthe Shah Nujeef was Captain Dawson.Sergeant Findlay, as already\nmentioned, had been taken over as hospital-assistant, and another\nsergeant named Wood was either sick or wounded, I forget which, and\nCorporals M'Kenzie and Mitchell (a namesake of mine, belonging to\nBalmoral) were killed.It thus fell to my lot as the non-commissioned\nofficer on duty to go round with Captain Dawson to post the sentries.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Kavanagh, who was officiating as a volunteer staff-officer,\naccompanied us to point out the direction of the strongest positions of\nthe enemy, and the likely points from which any attempts would be made\nto recapture our position during the night.During the absence of the\ncaptain the command of the company devolved on Colour-Sergeant David\nMorton, of \"Tobacco Soup\" fame, and he was instructed to see that none\nof the enemy were still lurking in the rooms surrounding the mosque of\nthe Shah Nujeef, while the captain was going round the ramparts placing\nthe sentries for the protection of our position.As soon as the sentries were posted on the ramparts and regular reliefs\ntold off, arrangements were made among the sergeants and corporals to\npatrol at regular intervals from sentry to sentry to see that all were\nalert.This was the more necessary as the men were completely worn out\nand fatigued by long marches and heavy fighting, and in fact had not\nonce had their belts off for a week previous, while all the time\ncarrying double ammunition on half-empty stomachs.Every precaution had\ntherefore to be taken that the sentries should not go to sleep, and it\nfell to me as the corporal on duty to patrol the first two hours of the\nnight, from eight o'clock till ten.The remainder of the company\nbivouacked around the piled arms, which were arranged carefully loaded\nand capped with bayonets fixed, ready for instant action should an\nattack be made on our position.After the great heat of the day the\nnights by contrast felt bitterly cold.There was a stack of dry wood in\nthe centre of the grounds from which the men kindled a large fire near\nthe piled arms, and arranged themselves around it, rolled in their\ngreatcoats but fully accoutred, ready to stand to arms at the least\nalarm.In writing these reminiscences it is far from my wish to make them an\nautobiography.My intention is rather to relate the actions of others\nthan recount what I did myself; but an adventure happened to me in the\nShah Nujeef which gave me such a nervous fright that to this day I often\ndream of it.I have forgotten to state that when the force advanced\nfrom the Alumbagh each man carried his greatcoat rolled into what was\nthen known in our regiment as the \"Crimean roll,\" with ends strapped\ntogether across the right shoulder just over the ammunition pouch-belt,\nso that it did not interfere with the free use of the rifle, but rather\nformed a protection across the chest.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.As it turned out many men owed\ntheir lives to the fact that bullets became spent in passing through the\nrolled greatcoats before reaching a vital part.Now it happened that in\nthe heat of the fight in the Secundrabagh my greatcoat was cut right\nthrough where the two ends were fastened together, by the stroke of a\nkeen-edged _tulwar_ which was intended to cut me across the shoulder,\nand as it was very warm at the time from the heat of the mid-day sun\ncombined with the excitement of the fight, I was rather glad than\notherwise to be rid of the greatcoat; and when the fight was over, it\ndid not occur to me to appropriate another one in its place from one of\nmy dead comrades.But by ten o'clock at night there was a considerable\ndifference in the temperature from ten in the morning, and when it came\nto my turn to be relieved from patrol duty and to lie down for a sleep,\nI felt the cold wet grass anything but comfortable, and missed my\ngreatcoat to wrap round my knees; for the kilt is not the most suitable\ndress imaginable for a bivouac, without greatcoat or plaid, on a cold,\ndewy November night in Upper India; with a raw north wind the climate of\nLucknow feels uncommonly cold at night in November, especially when\ncontrasted with the heat of the day.I have already mentioned that the\nsun had set before we entered the Shah Nujeef, the surrounding enclosure\nof which contained a number of small rooms round the inside of the\nwalls, arranged after the manner of the ordinary Indian native\ntravellers' _serais_.The Shah Nujeef, it must be remembered, was the\ntomb of Ghazee-ood-deen Hyder, the first king of Oude, and consequently\na place of Mahommedan pilgrimage, and the small rooms round the four\nwalls of the square were for the accommodation of pilgrims.These rooms\nhad been turned into quarters by the enemy, and, in their hurry to\nescape, many of them had left their lamps burning, consisting of the\nordinary _chirags_[22] placed in small niches in the walls, leaving also\ntheir evening meal of _chupatties_ in small piles ready cooked, and the\ncurry and _dhal_[23] boiling on the fires.Many of the lamps were still\nburning when my turn of duty was over, and as I felt the want of a\ngreatcoat badly, I asked the colour-sergeant of the company (the captain\nbeing fast asleep) for permission to go out of the gate to where our\ndead were collected near the Secundrabagh to get another one.This\nColour-Sergeant Morton refused, stating that before going to sleep the\ncaptain had given strict orders that except those on sentry no man was\nto leave his post on any pretence whatever.I had therefore to try to\nmake the best of my position, but although dead tired and wearied out I\nfelt too uncomfortable to go to sleep, and getting up it struck me that\nsome of the sepoys in their hurried departure might have left their\ngreatcoats or blankets behind them.With this hope I went into one of\nthe rooms where a lamp was burning, took it off its shelf, and shading\nthe flame with my hand walked to the door of the great domed tomb, or\nmosque, which was only about twenty or thirty yards from where the arms\nwere piled and the men lying round the still burning fire.I peered into\nthe dark vault, not knowing that it was a king's tomb, but could see\nnothing, so I advanced slowly, holding the _chirag_ high over my head\nand looking cautiously around for fear of surprise from a concealed\nenemy, till I was near the centre of the great vault, where my progress\nwas obstructed by a big black heap about four or five feet high, which\nfelt to my feet as if I were walking among loose sand.I lowered the\nlamp to see what it was, and immediately discovered that I was standing\nup to the ankles in _loose gunpowder_!of it lay in a\ngreat heap in front of my nose, while a glance to my left showed me a\nrange of twenty to thirty barrels also full of powder, and on the right\nover a hundred 8-inch shells, all loaded with the fuses fixed, while\nspare fuses and slow matches and port-fires in profusion lay heaped\nbeside the shells.By this time my eyes had become accustomed to the darkness of the\nmosque, and I took in my position and my danger at a glance.Here I was\nup to my knees in powder,--in the very bowels of a magazine with a\nnaked light!My hair literally stood on end; I felt the skin of my head\nlifting my feather bonnet off my scalp; my knees knocked together, and\ndespite the chilly night air the cold perspiration burst out all over me\nand ran down my face and legs.I had neither cloth nor handkerchief in\nmy pocket, and there was not a moment to be lost, as already the\noverhanging wick of the _chirag_ was threatening to shed its smouldering\nred tip into the live magazine at my feet with consequences too\nfrightful to contemplate.Quick as thought I put my left hand under the\ndown-dropping flame, and clasped it with a grasp of determination;\nholding it firmly I slowly turned to the door, and walked out with my\nknees knocking one against the other!Fear had so overcome all other\nfeeling that I am confident I never felt the least pain from grasping\nthe burning wick till after I was outside the building and once again in\nthe open air; but when I opened my hand I felt the smart acutely enough.I poured the oil out of the lamp into the burnt hand, and kneeling down\nthanked God for having saved myself and all the men lying around me from\nhorrible destruction.I then got up and, staggering rather than walking\nto the place where Captain Dawson was sleeping, and shaking him by the\nshoulder till he awoke, I told him of my discovery and the fright I had\ngot.At first he either did not believe me, or did not comprehend the danger.Corporal Mitchell,\" was all his answer, \"you have woke up out of\nyour sleep, and have got frightened at a shadow,\" for my heart was\nstill thumping against my ribs worse than it was when I first discovered\nmy danger, and my voice was trembling.I turned my smarting hand to the\nlight of the fire and showed the captain how it was scorched; and then,\nfeeling my pride hurt at being told I had got frightened at a shadow, I\nsaid: \"Sir, you're not a Highlander or you would know the Gaelic proverb\n'_The heart of one who can look death in the face will not start at a\nshadow_,' and you, sir, can yourself bear witness that I have not\nshirked to look death in the face more than once since daylight this\nmorning.\"He replied, \"Pardon me, I did not mean that; but calm yourself\nand explain what it is that has frightened you.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.I then told him that I\nhad gone into the mosque with a naked lamp burning, and had found it\nhalf full of loose gunpowder piled in a great heap on the floor and a\nlarge number of loaded shells.\"Are you sure you're not dreaming from\nthe excitement of this terrible day?\"With that I\nlooked down to my feet and my gaiters, which were still covered with\nblood from the slaughter in the Secundrabagh; the wet grass had softened\nit again, and on this the powder was sticking nearly an inch thick.I\nscraped some of it off, throwing it into the fire, and said, \"There is\npositive proof for you that I'm not dreaming, nor my vision a shadow!\"On that the captain became almost as alarmed as I was, and a sentry was\nposted near the door of the mosque to prevent any one from entering it.The sleeping men were aroused, and the fire smothered out with as great\ncare as possible, using for the purpose several earthen _ghurrahs_, or\njars of water, which the enemy had left under the trees near where we\nwere lying.When all was over, Colour-Sergeant Morton coolly proposed to the captain\nto place me under arrest for having left the pile of arms after he, the\ncolour-sergeant, had refused to give me leave.To this proposal Captain\nDawson replied: \"If any one deserves to be put under arrest it is you\nyourself, Sergeant Morton, for not having explored the mosque and\ndiscovered the gunpowder while Corporal Mitchell and I were posting the\nsentries; and if this neglect comes to the notice of either Colonel Hay\nor the Commander-in-Chief, both you and I are likely to hear more about\nit; so the less you say about the matter the better!\"This ended the\ndiscussion and my adventure, and at the time I was glad to hear nothing\nmore about it, but I have sometimes since thought that if the part I\nacted in this crisis had come to the knowledge of either Colonel Hay or\nSir Colin Campbell, my burnt hand would have brought me something more\nthan a proposal to place me under arrest, and take my corporal's stripes\nfrom me!Be that as it may, I got a fright that I have never forgotten,\nand, as already mentioned, even to this day I often dream of it, and\nwake up with a sudden start, the cold perspiration in great beads on my\nface, as I think I see again the huge black heap of powder in front of\nme.After a sentry had been posted on the mosque and the fire put out, a\nglass lantern was discovered in one of the rooms, and Captain Dawson\nand I, with an escort of three or four men, made the circuit of the\nwalls, searching every room.I remember one of the escort was James\nWilson, the same man who wished to bayonet the Hindoo _jogie_ in the\nvillage who afterwards shot poor Captain Mayne as told in my fourth\nchapter.As Wilson was peering into one of the rooms, a concealed sepoy\nstruck him over the head with his _tulwar_, but the feather bonnet saved\nhis scalp as it had saved many more that day, and Captain Dawson being\narmed with a pair of double-barrelled pistols, put a bullet through the\nsepoy before he had time to make another cut at Wilson.In the same room\nI found a good cotton quilt which I promptly annexed to replace my lost\ngreatcoat.After all was quiet, the men rolled off to sleep again, and wrapping\nround my legs my newly-acquired quilt, which was lined with silk and had\nevidently belonged to a rebel officer, I too lay down and tried to\nsleep.My nerves were however too much shaken, and the pain of my burnt\nhand kept me awake, so I lay and listened to the men sleeping around me;\nand what a night that was!Had I the descriptive powers of a Tennyson or\na Scott I might draw a picture of it, but as it is I can only very\nfaintly attempt to make my readers imagine what it was like.The\nhorrible scenes through which the men had passed during the day had told\nwith terrible effect on their nervous systems, and the struggles,--eye\nto eye, foot to foot, and steel to steel--with death in the\nSecundrabagh, were fought over again by most of the men in their sleep,\noaths and shouts of defiance often curiously intermingled with prayers.One man would be lying calmly sleeping and commence muttering something\ninaudible, and then break out into a fierce battle-cry of \"Cawnpore, you\nbloody murderer!\";\nand a third, \"Keep together, boys, don't fire; forward, forward; if we\nare to die, let us die like men!\"Then I would hear one muttering, \"Oh,\nmother, forgive me, and I'll never leave you again!<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.\"; while his comrade\nwould half rise up, wave his hand, and call, \"There they are!And so it was throughout that\nmemorable night inside the Shah Nujeef; and I have no doubt but it was\nthe same with the men holding the other posts.The pain of my burnt hand\nand the terrible fright I had got kept me awake, and I lay and listened\ntill nearly daybreak; but at length completely worn out, I, too, dosed\noff into a disturbed slumber, and I suppose I must have behaved in much\nthe same way as those I had been listening to, for I dreamed of blood\nand battle, and then my mind would wander to scenes on Dee and Don side,\nand to the Braemar and Lonach gathering, and from that the scene would\nsuddenly change, and I was a little boy again, kneeling beside my\nmother, saying my evening-hymn.Verily that night convinced me that\nCampbell's _Soldier's Dream_ is no mere fiction, but must have been\nwritten or dictated from actual experience by one who had passed\nthrough such another day of excitement and danger as that of the 16th\nof November, 1857.My dreams were rudely broken into by the crash of a round-shot through\nthe top of the tree under which I was lying, and I jumped up repeating\naloud the seventh verse of the ninety-first Psalm, Scotch version:\n\n    A thousand at thy side shall fall,\n      On thy right hand shall lie\n    Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee\n      It shall not once come nigh.Captain Dawson and the sergeants of the company had been astir long\nbefore, and a party of ordnance-lascars from the ammunition park and\nseveral warrant-officers of the Ordnance-Department were busy removing\nthe gunpowder from the tomb of the Shah Nujeef.Over sixty _maunds_[24]\nof loose powder were filled into bags and carted out, besides twenty\nbarrels of the ordinary size of powder-barrels, and more than one\nhundred and fifty loaded 8-inch shells.The work of removal was scarcely\ncompleted before the enemy commenced firing shell and red-hot round-shot\nfrom their batteries in the Badshahibagh across the Goomtee, aimed\nstraight for the door of the tomb facing the river, showing that they\nbelieved the powder was still there, and that they hoped they might\nmanage to blow us all up.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[20] \"God is great!\"The\nfirst two are Mussulman war-cries; the last is Hindoo.[22] Little clay saucers of oil, with a loosely twisted cotton wick.CHAPTER VI\n\nBREAKFAST UNDER DIFFICULTIES--LONG SHOTS--THE LITTLE DRUMMER--EVACUATION\nOF THE RESIDENCY BY THE GARRISON\n\n\nBy this time several of the old campaigners had kindled a fire in one of\nthe small rooms, through the roof of which one of our shells had fallen\nthe day before, making a convenient chimney for the egress of the smoke.They had found a large copper pot which had been left by the sepoys, and\nhad it on the fire filled with a stew of about a score or more of\npigeons which had been left shut up in a dovecot in a corner of the\ncompound.There were also plenty of pumpkins and other vegetables in the\nrooms, and piles of _chupatties_ which had been cooked by the sepoys for\ntheir evening meal before they fled.Everything in fact was there for\nmaking a good breakfast for hungry men except salt, and there was no\nsalt to be found in any of the rooms; but as luck favoured us, I had one\nof the old-fashioned round cylinder-shaped wooden match-boxes full of\nsalt in my haversack, which was more than sufficient to season the stew.I had carried this salt from Cawnpore, and I did so by the advice of an\nold veteran who had served in the Ninety-Second Gordon Highlanders all\nthrough the Peninsular war, and finally at Waterloo.When as a boy I had\noften listened to his stories and told him that I would also enlist for\na soldier, he had given me this piece of practical advice, which I in my\nturn present to every young soldier and volunteer.It is this: \"Always\ncarry a box of salt in your haversack when on active service; because\nthe commissariat department is usually in the rear, and as a rule when\nan army is pressed for food the men have often the chance of getting\nhold of a bullock or a sheep, or of fowls, etc., but it is more\ndifficult to find salt, and even good food without salt is very\nunpalatable.\"I remembered the advice, and it proved of great service to\nmyself and comrades in many instances during the Mutiny.As it was,\nthanks to my foresight the hungry men in the Shah Nujeef made a good\nbreakfast on the morning of the 17th of November, 1857.I may here say\nthat my experience is that the soldiers who could best look after their\nstomachs were also those who could make the best use of the bayonet, and\nwho were the least likely to fall behind in a forced march.If I had the\ncommand of an army in the field my rule would be: \"Cut the grog, and\ngive double grub when hard work has to be done!\"After making a good breakfast the men were told off in sections, and we\ndischarged our rifles at the enemy across the Goomtee,[25] and then\nspunged them out, which they sorely needed, because they had not been\ncleaned from the day we advanced from the Alumbagh.Our rifles had in\nfact got so foul with four days' heavy work that it was almost\nimpossible to load them, and the recoil had become so great that the\nshoulders of many of the men were perfectly black with bruises.As soon\nas our rifles were cleaned, a number of the best shots in the company\nwere selected to try and silence the fire from the battery in the\nBadshahibagh across the river, which was annoying us by endeavouring to\npitch hot shot and shell into the tomb, and to shorten the distance they\nhad brought their guns outside the gate on to the open ground.They\nevidently as yet did not understand the range of the Enfield rifle, as\nthey now came within about a thousand to twelve hundred yards of the\nwall of the Shah Nujeef next the river.Some twenty of the best shots in\nthe company, with carefully cleaned and loaded rifles, watched till they\nsaw a good number of the enemy near their guns, then, raising sights to\nthe full height and carefully aiming high, they fired a volley by word\nof command slowly given--_one, two, fire!_ and about half a dozen of the\nenemy were knocked over.They at once withdrew their guns inside the\nBadshahibagh and shut the gate, and did not molest us any more.During the early part of the forenoon we had several men struck by rifle\nbullets fired from one of the minarets in the Motee Mahal, which was\nsaid to be occupied by one of the ex-King of Oude's eunuchs who was a\nfirst-rate marksman, and armed with an excellent rifle; from his\nelevated position in the minaret he could see right into the square of\nthe Shah Nujeef.We soon had several men wounded, and as there was no\nsurgeon with us Captain Dawson sent me back to where the field-hospital\nwas formed near the Secundrabagh, to ask Dr.Munro if an\nassistant-surgeon could be spared for our post.The boys took a long breath when Jerry had finished his story, and more\nthan one bright eye was filled with tears.The rough words, and plain,\nunpolished manner of the old soldier, only heightened the impression\nmade by his story; and as he rose to go away, evidently much moved by\nthe painful recollections it excited, there was a hearty, \"Thank you,\nsergeant, for your story--it was real good!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.Jerry only touched his cap\nto the young soldiers, and marched off hastily, while the boys looked\nafter him in respectful silence.But young spirits soon recover from\ngloomy influences, and in a few moments they were all chattering merrily\nagain.cried Louie; \"I wish we could camp\nout forever!Oh, Freddy, do write a letter to General McClellan, and ask\nhim to let us join the army right away!Tell him we'll buy some new\nindia-rubber back-bones and stretch ourselves out big directly, if he'll\nonly send right on for us!\"\"Perhaps he would, if he knew how jolly we can drill already!\"\"I tell you what, boys, the very thing!let's have a\nreview before we go home.I'll ask all the boys and girls I know to come\nand look on, and we might have quite a grand entertainment.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and\neverything!\"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?\"\"Why--I don't know,\" said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the\nsubject.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.\"Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean\nto ask my father right away.\"Finally it was\nconcluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,\nif the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for\ntheir swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the\nbattalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all\nthe time, in utter defiance of that \"article of war\" which forbids\n\"talking in the ranks.\"Just as they were passing the lake, they heard\ncarriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on\nthe other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the\nastonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about\nFreddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome\nbarouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, \"what in the world is all\nthis?\"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, \"why, these are the\nDashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie,\" to the little girl on the front seat, who\nwas looking on with deep interest.\"Oh, to be sure, I remember,\" said Miss Carlton, laughing; \"come,\nintroduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!\"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took\nplace.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and\nconfident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little\nJessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated\ncourt martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of\nthe grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with\nhis handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only\nthose poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.He chattered\naway with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise\nthat she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the\nunited petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know\nof Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed\nthem to come up to the house \"anyhow.\"The carriage was accordingly\ntaken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the\nZouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young\nladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the\nhorses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of\nthe coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn\nround and talk, didn't know \"where to have them,\" as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and\nfound Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.He hastened forward to meet\nthem, with the cordial greeting of an old friend.\"Well, old bachelor,\" said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies\nascended the steps, \"you see we have come to visit you in state, with\nthe military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four\nbrothers on the Potomac.\"Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'\" said Mr.\"Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be\nleft.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,\nmademoiselle?\"\"Really, I beg their pardons,\" exclaimed Miss Carlton.\"They have come\non a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us\ninterrupt business.\"Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,\na little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the\nfollowing brief oration: \"Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys\nwant--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask\nour friends to look on.Schermerhorn,\nsmiling; \"but what will become of you good people when I tell you that\nI have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join\nher this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me.\"interrupted Peter; \"can't you tell ma\nI've joined the army for the war?\"No, the army\nmust give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just\nhave the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but\nas the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I\nhad intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only\nthing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy\nend being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a\nfellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to\nkeep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to\nchoke him on from morning till night?\"as Tom indignantly remarked to\nGeorge and Will the same evening.\"The fact is, this sort of thing is\n_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!\"an opinion in which the other _men_\nfully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a\nfew moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided\nto accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a\nbright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in\napple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special\ncharge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only\na soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque\ngroup--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the\nladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite\nreminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in\nwhich George alone quite came up to the regulation \"63 inches.\"Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,\nwho would have given their brightest buttons, every \"man\" of them, to be\nthe most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery\nand the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful\nfashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the\ntents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked\nin); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is\nthe greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy\nmade her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous \"glass agates;\"\none of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other\npatriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter\nclimbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a\nbough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with \"ox hearts;\" Harry\neagerly offered to make any number of \"stunning baskets\" out of the\nstones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before.was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A\nprivate remark was also circulated to the effect that \"Miss Jessie was\nstunningly pretty.\"The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully\nto send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off\nhighly", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Schermerhorn decided to take\nthe afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the\nboys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two\no'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,\nconcerning the event to come off on the morrow.\"I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review,\" said\nJimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and\nlooking solemnly round the table.\"March about,\nand form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming\n\"parade rest,\" \"'der humps!\"and the rest of it; and finish off by\nfiring off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any\npossibility!\"\"But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder,\" said Peter\ndisconsolately.\"You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last\nFourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!\"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George\nsaid, \"You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?\"\"No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped\nthe 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the\nnasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play\nwith powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.\"\"Well, we must take it out in marching, then,\" said Freddy, with a\ntremendous sigh.\"No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!\"\"I have\nsome 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of\nthe cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother\nthis afternoon and get them.\"The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,\ncoming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the\nolder ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his\nbright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,\nhe heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,\nschoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy.\"I ran after you all the way,\" he pantingly said.\"I want to tell you,\ndear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,\nand how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as\nanything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and\nI feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable\ncourt martial.\"\"There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!\"was the hearty\nresponse; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion.\"It\nwas my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how\nsilly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.\"\"Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so\nwe will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this\nabominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to\ndescribe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed\nZouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the\nfollowing day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in\nhistory for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran\npoor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible\nvariety of exercise known to \"Hardee's Tactics,\" and nearly dislocated\ntheir shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward\nall at once when they went at \"double quick;\" at the same time keeping\nthe other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful\noperation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered\ndown nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and\na special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's\n\"'der arms!\"meant \"shoulder arms,\" and when \"order arms\" (or bringing\nall the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never\nwas such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of\nthe preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy\nclouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and\nnot a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of\nthe day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun\nwould be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry\nlet fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding\nhigh council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of\nat the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a\nmoment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn\nentered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of\neager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a\ncolony of rooks.\"Patience, patience, my good friends!\"Schermerhorn, holding\nup a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double\nheaders,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,\nand they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left\nfor you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in\ngeneral--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,\nand then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end\nof the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can\nhelp at present;\" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,\nunder strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which\nsuddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as\nthey could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four\no'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after\nanother, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and\nsoon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown\nreason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little\ntrilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,\nfolded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to\ndo with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in\nequal danger of irremediable \"mussing,\" as she fidgetted about on the\ncarriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs\nin the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best\nview of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the\nwhite tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a\nmagnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the\nlawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental\ngrounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view\nwas bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could\nbe seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit\nof regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice\nwas heard shouting, \"Are ye all ready now?and to\nthe melodious notes of \"Dixie,\" performed by the band, which was\nstationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry\nmarching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious\nmandates as, \"Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the\nhouse!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and\ngentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed\nZouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood\nlike statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,\nwhile Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:\n\n\"To the rear--open order!\"and the rear rank straightway fell back;\nexecuting, in fact, that wonderful \"tekkinapesstoth'rare\" which had\npuzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those\nother wonderful orders:\n\n          \"P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,\nwith such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond\nmeasure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on\neach side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,\ndeclared \"It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!\"a\ncelebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened\nhis pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at\nlast produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this\nvolume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they\nwould give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to\nthe gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: \"DOUBLE-QUICK.\"]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the\nregiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,\nformed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called \"breaking into\nplatoons,\" showed how to \"wheel on the right flank,\" and all manner of\nother mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the\norder, they started at \"double quick\" (which is the most comical\ntritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the\nlawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment\nmore were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once\nagain like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the\nZouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off\ntheir saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in\nreturn, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the\nlittle remaining breath they had after the \"double quick.\"Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of\ntheir rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went\nthrough some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and\njump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to\nrather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, \"Close up\nin ranks to dismiss,\" when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and\nJessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,\n\"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony\nto go through with.\"The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could\nbe coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a\ngreat hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came\ntripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over\nher snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and\nblue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils\nencircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It\nwas made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was\npainted an American eagle, and on the other the words \"Dashahed\nZouaves,\" surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced\nto the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little\ntremulous, but very distinct, she said:\n\n          \"COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:\n\n          \"I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,\n          on the success you have achieved.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.You have shown\n          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a\n          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you\n          the colors of your regiment!\"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are\n          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you\n          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath\n          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down\n          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your\n          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name\n          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as\nhe advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our\nlittle Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member\nof the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have\nthought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with\nthe right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice\nthat he responded:\n\n          \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n\n          \"I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the\n          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,\n          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we\n          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness\n          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we\n          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we\n          fight, they shall never float over a retreating\n          battalion!\"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his\nhand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began\nplaying a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some\nlady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss\nLucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:\n\n          \"We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--\n          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;\n          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--\n          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,\n          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night\n          And the standard that guides us forever shall be\n          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"A handful of living--an army of dead,\n          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;\n          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain\n          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,\n          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see\n          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear\n          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;\n          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,\n          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,\n          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,\n          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the\nband struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves\nmarching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a\nbountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner\nof \"goodies,\" as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on\nthe sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a\nlarge flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the\nother officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took\ntheir seats.The other children found places around the table, and a\nmerrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively\nairs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,\nthat nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement\namong the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in\nsuch fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves\ntheir flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the\nsupper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the\nbeginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,\nof getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good\nfriends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a\npleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was\nquite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as\nthe company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the\nscene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and\ngentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly\npretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its\ncentre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all\ncrowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and\nadmiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and\nlistening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or\ngrown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,\ncentral figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful\nfor the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had\nscarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no\none else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he\nmoved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and\naffection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier\nbeat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the\nyoung Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental\ncolors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes\nthem out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once\nmore the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with\nquivering lip and flashing eye, \"Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,\nI'll live and die a soldier!\"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful\nplanet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the\ncamp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly\nached; and then they all shook hands with \"dear\" Jessie, as Charley was\nheard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her\nsoft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she\ncertainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the\ngood people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving\ntheir handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and\nso, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended\nthe very end of\n\n                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that \"day of disaster,\" when Camp McClellan\nmust be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,\nthought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five\ndays, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very\nshortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the\nbreaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by\nthe early afternoon boat.\"Is it possible we have been here a week?\"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat\ndown to breakfast.\"It seems as if we had only come yesterday.\"\"I don't want\nto go to Newport a bit.\"To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!\"added Tom, with a little\nblush.\"I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's\none too many rebels in the family.\"cried George Chadwick; \"the Pringles are a first rate\nfamily; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!\"and George gave\nTom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite\nbrought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and\nproceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not\nvery scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the\nbusiness was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and\nthen jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,\nand under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and\nplaced them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving\nthem to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;\nfor, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own\naffairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when\nit comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious\nlittle wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself\nout of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black\nCanadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall\nby a young lady in a saucy \"pork pie\" straw hat, who was driving--no\nother than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly\nsurrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, \"Jessie\nbegged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her.\"Really,\" repeated Freddy; \"but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just\nin time to see us off.\"\"You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all,\" said George;\n\"you will see the tents come down with a run presently.\"As he spoke, the donkey\ncart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and\nprepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,\ntwo of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from\none corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which\nsupported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated \"Now!\"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,\njust as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the\nfirst one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was\ndetached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and\ncharged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this\npurpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in\nhis hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it\nrapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, \"Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,\nthen, it is time to start for the boat.\"The boys turned and saw the\ncarriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to\nconvey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm\nwas rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony\nchaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to\nadore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and\nold Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate \"Good-by, my little\nColonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as\nlong as he lives.\"It would have seemed like insulting the old man to\noffer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome\ngilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of\nthe regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of\n\"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike.\"As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond\nthe capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on\nriding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of\ncarrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,\nwith that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with\nthree ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the\nregiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to\nsee the last of \"dear Jessie,\" until the locusts hid them from sight,\nwhen they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn\naccompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red\nbrickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the\nlovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party\ntook possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be\nwaiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers\nstreet, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the\ndepot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they\nhad to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this\nunusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers\nparading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,\nwhereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth\navenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine\nstyle, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping\nat the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one\nand another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon\nas possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they\nmarched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, \"I tell you\nwhat, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me\ngo to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I\ncan't think of anything else!\"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; \"and,\nFred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your\nregiment, won't you?\"answered Freddy; \"but you're the oldest, Tom,\nand, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget\nme when you come to your command!\"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to\ncome back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang\nthe bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of\neminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in\nhand, saying, \"Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll\nnever leave the Union!\"and the last words he heard Tom say were, \"No,\nby George, _never_!\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history\nof Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends\nDr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had\nmany a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the\nbeautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed\nin every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and\nlearn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to\nBaltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join\nFreddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger\nin after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the\nfield, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant\nyoung friend,\n\n                                 COLONEL FREDDY.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of \"Colonel\nFreddy,\" and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed\nand breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off\ntheir seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when\nanything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful\nstory that was seen \"before it was printed,\" and a great many \"oh's\" and\n\"ah's\" testified to their appreciation of the gallant \"Dashahed\nZouaves.\"They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true\nstory of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had\nbeen read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang\nup once more, exclaiming; \"Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,\nmayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?\"cried his sister; \"I wish I had been Jessie; what a\npity it wasn't all true!\"\"And what if I should tell you,\" said their mother, laughing, \"that a\nlittle bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was\nwonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?\"\"Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!\"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more\nquestions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time\nthey paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg\nher to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about\nit.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at\nlast one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more\nstories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,\nwhich looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; \"Aunt Fanny's\ndaughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!\"and dressing himself in a\ndouble quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,\nforgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of\nlightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;\nshouting, \"Come, get up!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.here's another Sock story for\nus!\"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's\nstockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to\ntheir places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the\nwrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the\nwhole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored\nmaxim, \"The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;\" George, meanwhile,\nperforming a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his\nfather opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down\nstairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to\nexamine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was\nagain a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read\n\"GERMAN SOCKS.\"\"These must be more stories like that\ndear 'Little White Angel.'\"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the\nfirst story, it was found to be called, \"God's Pensioners;\" and\ncommenced, \"It was a cold--\" but stop!This book was to be devoted\nto \"Colonel Freddy;\" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the\npublishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock\nStories.*       *       *       *       *\n\nTranscriber's Notes:\n\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 41, \"dilemna\" changed to \"dilemma\" (horns of this dilemma)\n\nPage 81, \"arttisically\" changed to \"artistically\" (his fork\nartistically)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.They come and go as Byron said some therapeutic fads came and went\nin his day.He spoke of the new things that astounded the people for a\nday, and then, as it has been with\n\n  \"Cowpox, tractors, galvanism and gas,\n  The bubble bursts and all is air at last.\"One says he has found that fasting is a panacea.Another says: \"He is a\nfool;

or why State medical boards are devoting\nso much space in their bulletins to warn and educate the people against\nthe awful fatality of consumption, when to cure it is so easy if doctors\nwill only use blood?Even if the hemotherapist does claim a little too much, there is yet no\ncause for terror.A leading Osteopathic journal proclaims in large\nletters that the Osteopath can remove the obstruction so that nature will\ncure consumption.Christian Scientists and Magnetic Healers have not yet admitted their\ndefeat, and there are many regulars who have not surrendered to the\nplague.So the poor consumptive may hope on (while his money lasts).Our\nmost conscientious physicians not only admit limitations in curing\ntuberculosis, but try to teach the people that they must not rely on being\n\"cured\" if they are attacked, but must work with the physician to prevent\nits contagion.The intelligent layman can say \"Amen\" to that doctrine.The question may be fairly put: \"Why not have more of such frankness from\nthe physician?\"The manner in which the admissions of doctors that they\nare unable to control tuberculosis with medicine or surgery alone has been\nreceived by intelligent people should encourage the profession.It would\nseem more fair to take the stand of Professor Osler when he says that\nsound hygienic advice for the prevention of diseases must largely take the\nplace of present medication and pretence of cure.As a member of the American Medical Association recently said, \"The\nplacebo will not fool intelligent people always.\"And when it is generally\nknown that most of a physician's medicines are given as placebos, do you\nwonder that the claims of \"drugless healers\" receive such serious\nconsideration?The absurd, conflicting claims of quack pretenders are bad enough to\nmuddle the situation and add to the turbidity of therapeutics; but all\nthis is not doing the medical profession nearly as much harm, nor driving\nas many people into the ranks of fad followers, as the inconsistencies and\ncontradictions among the so-called regulars.This was my opinion before I made any special study of therapeutics, and\nwhile studying I found numbers of prominent medical men who agree with me.One of them says that the \"criticisms,\" quarrels, contradictions, and\ninconsistencies of medical men are doing more to lower the profession in\nthe estimation of the intelligent laity and to cause people to follow the\nfads of \"new schools\" than all else combined.Think for a moment of some of these inconsistencies and contradictions.One doctor in a town tells the people that he \"breaks up\" typhoid fever.His rival, perhaps from the same college, tells the people that typhoid\nmust \"run its course\" and cannot be broken up, and that any man who claims\nthe contrary is a liar and a shyster.One surgeon makes a portion of the\npeople believe he has saved dozens of lives in that community by surgical\noperations; the other physicians of the town tell the people openly, or at\nleast hint, that there has been a great deal of needless butchery\nperformed in that community in the name of surgery.And then the people\nsee editorials in the daily press about the fad of having operations\nperformed, and read in their health culture or Osteopathic journals from\narticles by the greatest M.D.s, in which it is admitted that surgery is\npracticed too largely as a graft.Professor Osler is quoted as saying:\n\n    \"Surgeons are finding altogether too many cases of appendicitis these\n    days.Appendicitis is becoming so common and so easily detected that\n    the physician's wife can diagnose a case of it over the telephone.\"One leading physician says medical treatment has little beneficial effect\non pneumonia; another claims to be able to cure it, and lets the friends\nof his patient rely entirely on his medicine in the most desperate cases.Another says, \"All those clay preparations\nare frauds, and the only safe way to treat pneumonia is by blood letting.\"Thus it goes, and this is only a sample of contradictions that arise in\nthe treatment of diseases.Nor is the above an overdrawn picture.Most of it was from the journal of\nthe editor who said he refused to send it to a layman who had sent his\nmoney in advance.But all that same stuff has been hashed and rehashed to\nthe people through the sources I have already mentioned.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.There are not\nonly these evidences of inconsistencies to edify (?)the people, but\nconstantly recurring examples of incompetency and pretensions.There is no doubt a middle ground in all this, but it is not evident to\nthe casual observer.If the true physician would honestly admit his\nlimitations to the intelligent laity, much of this muddle would be\navoided.While by such a course he may occasionally temporarily lose a\npatient, in the end both the public and profession would gain.The time\nhas gone by to \"assume an air of infallibility toward the public.\"CHAPTER V.\n\nTHE EXPERT WITNESS AND PROPRIETARY MEDICINES.The \"Great Nerve Specialist\"--The Professional Witness a Jonah--The\n    \"Railway Spine\"--Is it Lack of Fairness and Honesty or Lack of Skill\n    and Learning?--Destruction of Fine Herds of Cattle Without\n    Compensation--Koch's Dictum and Denial--Koch's Tuberculin--The Serum\n    Tribe--Stupendous Sale of Nostrums--Druggist's Arguments--Use of\n    Proprietary Medicines Stimulates Sale of Nostrums.I wonder what the patrons of the sanitarium of the \"great nerve\nspecialist\" thought of his display of knowledge of the nervous system when\nhe was on the witness stand in a recent notorious case?A lawyer tangled\nhim up completely, and showed that the doctor had no accurate knowledge of\nthe anatomy of the nervous system.When asked the origin of the\nall-important pneumogastric nerve, he _thought_ it originated in a certain\nsegment of the spinal cord!This noted \"specialist\" was made perfectly\ncontemptible, and the whole profession must have blushed in shame at the\nspectacle presented.And that spectacle was not unnoticed by the\nintelligent laity.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.The professional witness has in most cases been a Jonah to the profession.It is about as easy to get the kind of testimony you want from a\nprofessional witness in a suit for damages for personal injuries as it is\nto get a doctor's certificate to get out of working your poll-tax, or a\ncertificate of physical soundness to carry fraternal life insurance.Let me recall the substance of a paper read a few years ago by perhaps the\ngreatest lawyer in Iowa (afterward governor of that State).He told of a\ntrial in which he had examined and cross-examined ten physicians.It was a\ntrial in which suit was brought to recover damages for personal injury, a\ngood illustration of the \"railway spine.\"One physician testified that the\npatient was afflicted with sclerosis of the spinal cord; another said it\nwas a plain case of congestion of the cord; another diagnosed degeneration\nof the cord; yet another said it was a true combination of all the\nconditions named by the first three.They all said there was atrophy of\nthe muscles of the left leg, and predicted that complete paralysis would\nsurely supervene.On the other side five noted physicians testified as positively that\nneither the spinal cord nor any nerve was injured; that there was no sign\nof atrophy or loss of power in the leg; and they seemed to think the\ndisease afflicting the patient was due to a fixed desire to secure a\nverdict for large damages from the railway company.One eminent specialist\nmade oath that the electrical test showed the partial reaction of\ndegeneration; another as famous challenged him to make the test again in\nthe presence of both.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.After it was made this second specialist went before\nthe jury and positively declared that there was no trace whatever of the\nreaction of degeneration, and that the muscles responded to the current\nprecisely as healthy muscles should.Then this eminent attorney adds: \"If the instances of such diversity were\nrare they might pass unnoticed, but they occur and re-occur as often as\nphysicians are called to the temple of justice for the expression of\nopinions.\"The lay mind imputes this clash of opinions either to lack of fairness and\nhonesty or lack of skill and learning.In either case the profession\nsuffers great injury in the estimation of those who should have for it\nonly the profoundest admiration and the most implicit faith.Again I ask,\nIs it any wonder people have lost implicit faith when they read many\nreports of similar cases rehashed in the various yellow journals put into\ntheir hands?Farmers submitted with all possible grace to the decrees of science when,\nby the authority of such a great man as Koch, their fine herds of cattle\nwere condemned as breeders and disseminators of the great white plague and\ndestroyed without compensation.But how do you think these same farmers\nfeel when they read in yellow journals that Koch has changed his mind\nabout bovine and human tuberculosis being identical, and has serious\ndoubts about the one contracting in any way the disease of the other.People read with renewed hope the glowing accounts of the wonderful\nachievements of Dr.Koch in finding a destroyer for the germ of\nconsumption.Somehow time has slipped by since that renowned discovery,\nwith consumption still claiming its victims, and many physicians are\nsaying \"Koch's great discovery is proving only a great disappointment.\"Drugless therapy journals are continually pouring out the vials of their\nwrath upon vaccination, antitoxin and all the serum tribe, and their\nvituperation is even excelled by vindictive denunciations of the same\nthings by the individual boomer journals that flood the land.Another bitter contention that is confusing some, and disgusting others,\nis the acrimonious strife between users and non-users of proprietary\nmedicines.This usually develops into a sort of \"rough house\" affair, the\ndruggist mixing up as savagely as the doctors before the fight is\nfinished.I know nothing of the rights or wrongs of the case nor of the\nmerits or demerits of proprietary medicines, but I do know this, however:\nThe stupendous sale of nostrums that in 1907 represented a sum of money\nsufficient to have provided every practitioner of medicine in the United\nStates with a two thousand dollar salary, has been helped by the use of\nproprietary medicines.I am aware that my position is likely to be called\nin question by many physicians.But they should hear druggists arguing\nwith people who hesitate about buying patent medicines because their\nphysicians tell them they should seldom take medicine unless prescribed by\na doctor.They would hear him say: \"Your doctor gives you medicines that\nare put up in quantities for him just as these patent medicines are put up\nfor us.\"He then produces literature and proves it--at least beyond the\nrefutation of the patient.Physicians would then realize, perhaps, how the\nuse of proprietary medicines stimulates the sale of nostrums.FAITH CURE AND GRAFT IN SURGERY.Suggestive Therapeutics Chief Stock in Trade--Advice of a Medical\n    College President--Disease Prevention Rather than Cure--Hygienic\n    Living--The Medical Pretender--\"Dangerous Diagnosis\" Graft--Great\n    Flourish of Trumpets--No \"Starving Time\" for Him--\"Big\n    Operations\"--Mutilating the Human Body--Dr.C.

West--Fee-Splitting and Commissions--A Nation of \"Dollar-Chasers\"--The\n    Public's Share of Responsibility--Senn's Advice--The \"Surgical\n    Conscience.\"I think we have enough before us to show why intelligent people become\nfollowers of fads.Seeing so many impositions and frauds, they forget all\nthe patient research and beneficent discoveries of noble men who have\ndevoted their lives to the work of giving humanity better health and\nlonger life.They are ready at once to denounce the whole medical system\nas a fraud, and become victims of the first \"new system\" or healing fad\nthat is plausibly presented to them.And here a question arises that is puzzling to many.If these systems are\nfads and frauds, why do they so rapidly get and retain so large a\nfollowing among intelligent people?The\nquacks of these fad schools get their cures, as every intelligent doctor\nof the old schools knows, in the same way and upon the same principle that\nis so important a factor in medical practice, _i.e._, _faith cure_--the\npsychic effect of the thing done, whether it be the giving of a dose of\nmedicine, a Christian Science pow-wow, the laying on of hands, the\n\"removal of a lesion\" by an Osteopath, the \"adjustment\" of the spine by a\nChiropractor, or what not.The principles of mind or faith cure are legitimately used by the honest\nphysician.Suggestive therapeutics is being systematically studied by many\nwho want to use it with honesty and intelligence.They realize fully that\nabuse of this principle figures largely in the maintenance of the shysters\nin their own school, and it is the very foundation of all new schools and\nhealing fads.The people must be made to know this, or fads will continue\nto flourish.The honest physician would be glad to have the people know more than this.He would be glad to have them know enough about symptoms of diseases to\nhave some idea when they really need the help of a physician.For he knows\nthat if the people knew this much all quacks would be speedily put out of\nbusiness.I wonder how many doctors know that observing people are beginning to\nsuspect that many physicians regulate the number of calls they make on a\npatient by motives other than the condition of the patient--size of\npocketbook and the condition of the roads, for instance.I am aware that\nsuch imputation is an insult to any physician worthy of the name, but the\nsad fact is that there are so many, when we count the quacks of all\nschools, unworthy of the name.Louis medical college once said to a large\ngraduating class: \"Young men, don't go to your work with timidity and\ndoubts of your ability to succeed.Look and act your part as physicians,\nand when you have doubts concerning your power over disease _remember\nthis_, ninety-five out of every hundred people who send for you would get\nwell just the same if they never took a drop of your medicine.\"I have\nnever mentioned this to a doctor who did not admit that it is perhaps\ntrue.If so, is there not enough in it alone to explain the apparent\nsuccess of quacks?Again I say there are many noble and brainy physicians, and these have\nmade practically all the great discoveries, invented all the useful\nappliances, written all the great books for other schools to study, and\nthey should have credit from the people for all this, and not be\nmisrepresented by little pretenders.Their teachings should be applied as\nthey gave them.The best of them to-day would have the people taught that\na physician's greatest work may be done in preventing rather than in\ncuring disease.Physicians of the Osler type would like to have the people\nunderstand how little potency drugs have to cure many dangerous diseases\nwhen they have a firm hold on the system.They would have some of the\nresponsibility removed from the shoulders of the physician by having the\npeople understand how much they may do by hygienic living and common-sense\nuse of natural remedies.But the conscientious doctor too often has to compete with the pretender\nwho wants the people to believe that _he_ is their hope and their\nsalvation, and in him they must trust.He wants them to believe that he\nhas a specific remedy for every disease that will go \"right to the spot\"\nand have the desired effect.People who believe this, and believe that\nwithout doctoring the patient could never get well, will sometimes try, or\nsee their neighbors try, a doctor of a \"new school.\"When they see about\nthe same proportion of sick recover, they conclude, of course, that the\ndoctor of the \"new school\" cured them, and is worthy to be forever after\nintrusted with every case of disease that may arise in their families.This is often brought about by the shyster M.D.overreaching himself by\ndiagnosing some simple affection as something very dangerous, in order to\nhave the greater credit in curing it.But he at times overestimates the\nconfidence of the family in his ability.They are ready to believe that\nthe patient's condition is critical, and in terror, wanting the help of\neverything that promises help, call in a doctor of some \"new school\"\nbecause neighbors told how he performed wonderful cures in their families.When the patient recovers speedily, as he would have done with no\ntreatment of any kind, and just as the shyster M.D.thought he would, the\nglory and credit of curing a \"bad case\" of a \"dangerous disease\" go to the\nnew system instead of redounding to the glory of Dr.Shyster, as he\nplanned it would.Is it any wonder true physicians sometimes get disgusted with their\nprofession when they see a shyster come into the town where they have\nworked for years, patiently and conscientiously building up a legitimate\npractice that begins to promise a decent living, and by such quack methods\nas diagnosing cases of simple fever, such as might come from acute\nindigestion or too much play in children, as something dangerous, typhoid\nor \"threatened typhoid,\" or cases of congestion of the lungs as \"lung\nfever,\" and by \"aborting\" or \"curing\" these terrible diseases in short\norder and having his patients out in a few days, jumps into fame and\n(financial) success at a bound?Because the typhoid (real typhoid)\npatients of the honest doctor lingered for weeks and sometimes died, and\nbecause frequently he lost a case of real pneumonia, he made but a poor\nshowing in comparison with the new doctor.\"He's just fresh from school,\nyou know, from a post-graduate course in the East.\"Or, \"He's been to the\nold country and _knows_ something.\"Just as if any physician, though he\nmay have been out of school for many years, does not, or may not, know of\nall the curative agencies of demonstrated merit!Would a medical journal fail to keep its readers posted concerning any new\ndiscovery in medicine, or helpful appliance that promises real good to the\nprofession?Yet people speak of one doctor's superior knowledge of the\nbest treatment of a particular disease as if that doctor had access to\nsome mysterious source of therapeutic knowledge unknown to other\nphysicians.It is becoming less easy to work the \"dangerous diagnosis\"\ngraft than formerly, for many people are learning that certain diseases\nmust \"run their course,\" and that there are no medicines that have\nspecific curative effects on them.There is another graft now that is taking the place of the one just\nmentioned, to some extent at least.In the hands of a fellow with lots of\nnerve and little conscience it is the greatest of them all.This is the\ngraft of the smart young fellow direct from a post-graduate course in the\nclinics of some great surgeon.He comes to town with a great flourish of trumpets.Of course, he observes\nthe ethics of the profession!The long accounts of his superior education\nand unusual experience with operative surgery are only legitimate items of\nnews for the local papers.It is only right that such an\nunusual doctor should have so much attention.There is no \"starving time\" for him.No weary wait of years for patients\nto come.At one bound he leaps into fame and fortune by performing \"big\noperations\" right and left, when before his coming such cases were only\noccasionally found, and then taken to surgeons of known ability and\nexperience.The reputable physician respects surgery, and would respect\nthe bright young fellow fresh from contact with the latest approved\nmethods who has nerve to undertake the responsibility of a dangerous\noperation when such an operation is really indicated.But when it comes to\nmutilating the human body by cutting away an appendix or an ovary because\nit is known that to remove them when neither they nor the victim are much\ndiseased is a comparatively safe and very _quick_ way to get a big\nreputation--that is the limit of quackery.And no wonder such a man is so\ncordially hated by his brethren.He not always hated because he mutilates\nhumanity so much, as because his spectacular graft in surgery is sure to\nbe taken as proof conclusive that he is superior in all other departments\nof therapeutics.And it puzzles observing laymen sometimes to know why all the successful\n(?)operations are considered such desirable items of news, while the\ncases that are not flattering in their outcome pass unmentioned.I find most complete corroboration of my contention in the president's\naddress, delivered before the Western Surgical and Gynecological\nAssociation at St.Louis, in 1907, by Charles W. Oviatt, M.D.This address\nwas published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, and I\nherewith reprint it in part:\n\n    \"The ambitious medical student does not usually get far into college\n    work before he aspires to become a surgeon.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.He sees in the surgical\n    clinics more definite and striking results than are discernible in\n    other branches.Without being able to judge of his own relative\n    fitness or whether he possesses the special aptitude so essential to\n    success, he decides to become a surgeon.There will always be room for\n    the young surgeon who, fitted by nature for the work, takes the time\n    and opportunity to properly prepare himself.There is more good\n    surgery being done to-day than ever before, and there are more good\n    surgeons being educated to do the work.If, however, the surgeon of\n    the future is to hold the high and honorable position our leaders have\n    held in the past, there must be some standard of qualification\n    established that shall protect the people against incompetency and\n    dishonesty in surgeons.\"That there is much that passes under the name of surgery being done\n    by ill-trained, incompetent men, will not be denied.What standard,\n    then, should be established, and what requirement should be made\n    before one should be permitted to do surgery?In his address as\n    chairman of the Section on Surgery and Anatomy of the American Medical\n    Association, at the Portland (1905) meeting, Dr.Maurice H. Richardson\n    deals with this subject in such a forceful, clear-cut way, that I take\n    the liberty to quote him at some length:\n\n        \"'The burden of the following remarks is that those only should\n        practice surgery who by education in the laboratory, in the\n        dissecting-room, by the bedside, and at the operating-table, are\n        qualified, first, to make reasonably correct deductions from\n        subjective and objective signs; secondly, to give sound advice for\n        or against operations; thirdly, to perform operations skillfully\n        and quickly, and, fourthly, to conduct wisely the after-treatment.\"'The task before me is a serious criticism of what is going on in\n        every community.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.I do not single out any community or any man.There is in my mind no doubt whatever that surgery is being\n        practiced by those who are incompetent to practice it--by those\n        whose education is imperfect, who lack natural aptitude, whose\n        environment is such that they never can gain that personal\n        experience which alone will really fit them for what surgery means\n        to-day.They are unable to make correct deductions from histories;\n        to predict probable events; to perform operations skillfully, or\n        to manage after-treatment.\"'All surgeons are liable to error, not only in diagnosis, but in\n        the performance of operations based on diagnosis.Such errors must\n        always be expected and included in the contingencies of the\n        practice of medicine and surgery.Doubtless many of my hearers can\n        recall cases of their own in which useless--or worse than\n        useless--operations have been performed.If, however, serious\n        operations are in the hands of men of large experience, such\n        errors will be reduced to a minimum.\"'Many physicians send patients for diagnosis and opinion as to\n        the advisability of operation without telling the consultant that\n        they themselves are to perform the operation.The diagnosis is\n        made and the operation perhaps recommended, when it appears that\n        the operation is to be in incompetent hands.His advice should be\n        conditional that it be carried out only by the competent.Many\n        operations, like the removal of the vermiform appendix in the\n        period of health, the removal of fibroids which are not seriously\n        offending, the removal of gall-stones that are not causing\n        symptoms, are operations of choice rather than of necessity; they\n        are operations which should never be advised unless they are to be\n        performed by men of the greatest skill.Furthermore, many\n        emergency operations, such as the removal of an inflamed appendix\n        and other operations for lesions which are not necessarily\n        fatal--should be forbidden and the patient left to the chances of\n        spontaneous recovery, if the operation proposed is to be performed\n        by an incompetent.\"'And is not the surgeon, appreciating his own unfitness in spite\n        of years of devotion, in the position to condemn those who lightly\n        take up such burdens without preparation and too often without\n        conscience?\"'In view of these facts, who should perform surgery?How shall\n        the surgeon be best fitted for these grave duties?As a matter of\n        right and wrong, who shall, in the opinion of the medical\n        profession, advise and perform these responsible acts and who\n        shall not?Surgical operations should be performed only by those\n        who are educated for that special purpose.\"'I have no hesitation in saying that the proper fitting of a man\n        for surgical practice requires a much longer experience as a\n        student and assistant than the most exacting schools demand.A man\n        should serve four, five or six years as assistant to an active\n        surgeon.During this period of preparation, as it were, as much\n        time as possible should be given to observing the work of the\n        masters of surgery throughout the world.'Richardson's ideal may seem almost utopian, there being so\n    wide a difference between the standard he would erect and the one\n    generally established, we must all agree that however impossible of\n    attainment under present conditions, such an ideal is none too high\n    and its future realization not too much to hope for.\"While there is being done enough poor surgery that is honest and well\n    intended, there is much being done that is useless, conscienceless,\n    and done for purely commercial ends.This is truly a disagreeable and\n    painful topic and one that I would gladly pass by, did I not feel that\n    its importance demands some word of condemnation coming through such\n    representative surgical organizations as this.\"The spirit of graft that has pervaded our ranks, especially here in\n    the West, is doing much to lower the standard and undermine the morals\n    and ethics of the profession.When fee-splitting and the paying of\n    commissions for surgical work began to be heard of something like a\n    decade ago, it seemed so palpably dishonest and wrong that it was\n    believed that it would soon die out, or be at least confined to the\n    few in whom the inherited commercial instinct was so strong that they\n    could not get away from it.But it did not die; on the other hand, it\n    has grown and flourished.\"In looking for an explanation for the existence of this evil, I think\n    several factors must be taken into account, among them being certain\n    changes in our social and economic conditions.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.This is an age of\n    commercialism.We are known to the world as a nation of \"dollar\n    chasers,\" where nearly everything that should contribute to right\n    living is sacrificed to the Moloch of money.The mad rush for wealth\n    which has characterized the business world, has in a way induced some\n    medical men, whether rightfully or wrongfully, to adopt the same\n    measures in self-protection.The patient or his friends too often\n    insist on measuring the value of our services with a commercial\n    yard-stick, the fee to be paid being the chief consideration.In this\n    way the public must come in for its share of responsibility for\n    existing conditions.So long as there are people who care so little\n    who operates on them, just so long will there be cheap surgeons, cheap\n    in every respect, to supply the demand.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.The demand for better\n    physicians and surgeons must come in part from those who employ their\n    services.\"Another source of the graft evil is the existence of low-grade,\n    irregular and stock-company medical schools.In many of these schools\n    the entrance requirements are not in evidence outside of their\n    catalogues.With no standard of character or ethics, these schools\n    turn out men who have gotten the little learning they possess in the\n    very atmosphere of graft.The existence of these schools seems less\n    excusable when we consider that our leading medical colleges rank with\n    the best in the world and are ample for the needs of all who should\n    enter the profession.Their constant aim is to still further elevate\n    the standard and to admit as students only those who give unmistakable\n    evidence of being morally and intellectually fit to become members of\n    the profession.\"Enough men of character, however, are entering the field through\n    these better schools to ensure the upholding of those lofty ideals\n    that have characterized the profession in the past and which are\n    essential to our continued progress.I think, therefore, that we may\n    take a hopeful view of the future.The demand for better prepared\n    physicians will eventually close many avenues that are now open to\n    students, greatly to the benefit of all.With the curtailing of the\n    number of students and a less fierce competition which this will\n    bring, there will be less temptation, less necessity, if you will, on\n    the part of general practitioners to ask for a division of fees.He\n    will come to see that honest dealing on his part with the patient\n    requiring special skill will in the long run be the best policy.He\n    will make a just, open charge for the services he has rendered and not\n    attempt to collect a surreptitious fee through a dishonest surgeon for\n    services he has not rendered and could not render.Then, too, there\n    will be less inducement and less opportunity for incompetent and\n    conscienceless men to disgrace the art of surgery.\"The public mind is becoming especially active just at this time in\n    combating graft in all forms, and is ready to aid in its destruction.The intelligent portion of the laity is becoming alive to the patent\n    medicine evil.It is only a question of time when the people will\n    demand that the secular papers which go into our homes shall not\n    contain the vile, disgusting and suggestive quack advertisements that\n    are found to-day.A campaign of reform is being instituted against\n    dishonest politicians, financiers, railroad and insurance magnates,\n    showing that their methods will be no longer tolerated.The moral\n    standards set for professional men and men in public life are going to\n    be higher in the future, and with the limelight of public opinion\n    turned on the medical and surgical grafter, the evil will cease to\n    exist.Hand in hand with this reform let us hope that there will come\n    to be established a legal and moral standard of qualification for\n    those who assume to do surgery.\"I feel sure that it is the wish of every member of this association\n    to do everything possible to hasten the coming of this day and to aid\n    in the uplifting of the art of surgery.Our individual effort in this\n    direction must lie largely through the influence we exert over those\n    who seek our advice before beginning the study of medicine, and over\n    those who, having entered the work, are to follow in our immediate\n    footsteps.To the young man who seeks our counsel as to the\n    advisability of commencing the study of medicine, it is our duty to\n    make a plain statement of what would be expected of him, of the cost\n    in time and money, and an estimate of what he might reasonably expect\n    as a reward for a life devoted to ceaseless study, toil and\n    responsibility.If, from our knowledge of the character, attainments\n    and qualifications of the young man we feel that at best he could make\n    but a modicum of success in the work, we should endeavor to divert his\n    ambition into some other channel.\"We should advise the 'expectant surgeon' in his preparation to follow\n    as nearly as possible the line of study suggested by Richardson.Then\n    I would add the advice of Senn, viz: 'To do general practice for\n    several years, return to laboratory work and surgical anatomy, attend\n    the clinics of different operators, and never cease to be a physician.If this advice is followed there will be less unnecessary operating\n    done in the future than has been the case in the past.'The young man\n    who enters special work without having had experience as a general\n    practitioner, is seriously handicapped.In this age, when we have so\n    frequently to deal with the so-called border-line cases, it is\n    especially well never to cease being a physician.\"We would next have the young man assure himself that he is the\n    possessor of a well-developed, healthy, working'surgical conscience.'No matter how well qualified he may be, his enthusiasm in the earlier\n    years of his work will lead him to do operations that he would refrain\n    from in later life.He knows that early and thorough radical measures alone hold out hope,\n    and only by repeated unsuccessful efforts will he learn to temper his\n    ambition by the judgment that comes of experience.Pirogoff, the noted\n    surgeon, suffered from a malignant growth.Billroth refused to operate\n    or advise operation.In writing to another surgeon friend he said: 'I\n    am not the bold operator whom you knew years ago in Zurich.Before\n    deciding on the necessity of an operation, I always propose to myself\n    this question: Would you permit such an operation as you intend\n    performing on your patient to be done on yourself?Years and\n    experience bring in their train a certain degree of hesitancy", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "This,\n    coming from one who in his day was the most brilliant operator in the\n    world, should be remembered by every surgeon, young and old.\"In the hands of the skilled,\nconscientious surgeon how great are thy powers for good to suffering\nhumanity!In the hands of shysters \"what crimes are committed in thy\nname!\"With his own school full of shysters and incompetents, and grafters of\n\"new schools\" and \"systems\" to compete with on every hand, the\nconscientious physician seems to be \"between the devil and the deep sea!\"With quacks to the right of him, quacks to the left of him, quacks in\nfront of him, all volleying and thundering with their literature to prove\nthat the old schools, and all schools other than theirs, are frauds,\nimpostors and poisoners, about all that is left for the layman to do when\nsick is to take to the woods.PART TWO\n\nOSTEOPATHY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.Romantic Story of Osteopathy's Origin--An Asthma Cure--Headache Cured\n    by Plowlines--Log Rolling to Relieve Dysentery--Osteopathy is Drugless\n    Healing--Osteopathy is Manual Treatment--Liberty of Blood, Nerves and\n    Arteries--Perfect Skeletal Alignment and Tonic, Ligamentous, Muscular\n    and Facial Relaxation--Andrew T. Still in 1874--Kirksville, Mo., as a\n    Mecca--American School of Osteopathy--The Promised Golden Stream of\n    Prosperity--Shams and Pretenses--The \"Mossbacks\"--\"Who's Who in\n    Osteopathy.\"The story of the origin of Osteopathy is romantic enough to appeal to the\nfancy of impressionists.It is almost as romantic as the finding of the\nmysterious stones by the immortal Joe Smith.In this story is embodied the\nlife history of an old-time doctor and pioneer hero in his restless\nmigrations about the frontiers of Kansas and Missouri.His thrilling\nexperiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are\nnarrated, and how the germ of the idea of the true cause and cure of\ndisease was planted in his mind by the remark of a comrade as the two lay\nconcealed in a thicket for days to escape border ruffians.Then, later,\nhow the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom\nall his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had\nbeen powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that\ndrugs could cure disease.He believed Nature had a true system, and for\nthis he began a patient search.He wandered here and there, almost in the\ncondition of the religious reformers of old, who \"wandered up and down\nclad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy.\"In\nthe name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he\nmight read from his red bones some clue to the secret.One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to\nthe discovery of the \"great truth.\"It states that by accidentally curing\na case of asthma by \"fooling with the bones of the chest,\" he was led to\nthe belief that bones out of normal position cause disease.Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing\nof late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics.In this\nmagazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by\ncuring a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing\nmade of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a\nlog to relieve the pain of dysentery.Accidentally the \"lesion\" was\ncorrected, or the proper center \"inhibited,\" and his headache and flux\nimmediately cured.You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful\ndiscovery.Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to\ninquire \"What is it?\"its leading promoters have vied with each other in\ntrying to construct a good definition for their \"great new science.\"Here are some of the definitions:\n\n\"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing.\"For a genuine \"lesion\"\nOsteopath that would not do at all.It is too broad and gives too much\nscope to the physicians who would do more than \"pull bones.\"\"Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and\nscientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease.\"That definition\nsuits better, because of the \"manual treatment.\"If you are a true\nOsteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any\nmechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression\nthat you are \"handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who\nknows every part of his machine.\"\"The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that\nit may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,\nnerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination.\"This\ndefinition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we\nwonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same\neffect.\"Liberty of blood\" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must\nadmit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or\nhot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate\ncirculation, is rational.But when \"liberty of blood\" is mentioned, what\nis meant by \"liberty of arteries\"?\"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic\nligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation.\"Some Osteopaths and other\ntherapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used\n\"big words\" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of\nthe one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,\ntechnical terms and \"high-sounding nothings\" used by so many Osteopathic\nwriters.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,\nPh.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general\npublic in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify\ngreat truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If\nwriters for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying\nand popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on\nOsteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary\nis taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and\nmotives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading\npromoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be\nwithheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in\nKansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He\nwas at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.During the Civil War\nhe was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the\nwar that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something\nnatural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by\nhis profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the\ndiscovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of\nKirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had\nimplicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious\nmovements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn\ntoward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's\nhealing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,\nwhich from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and\nequipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated\nyearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been\nfounded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number\nof schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the\ncountry.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and\nthis number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians\nthan are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic\nreports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable\nlegal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I\nshall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and\nwomen who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater\nimportance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide\nwhich system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their\nlives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one\ninjustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the\ncause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents\nthe sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of\ntelling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this \"new science\" of\nhealing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes\nbold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of\npractitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy\nfor disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of\nOsteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that\nsince the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are\nso blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the\npractice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic\ncollege that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim\nmyself as an exponent of a \"complete and well-rounded system of healing,\nadequate for every emergency,\" as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the\njournals published for \"Osteopathic physicians\" to scatter broadcast among\nthe people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an\nOsteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility\nfor human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the\ncase as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy\nwould cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been\ncalled a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not\npractice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and \"subluxated,\" and tell\npeople that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five\ndollars per month, to have one or two \"subluxations\" corrected.In\nconsequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the\nliterature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to\nall \"Osteopathic physicians\" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies\nof Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with\nsome of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor\nof an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This\neditor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in\nwhich he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,\nas I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as\nhe acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I\nbelieve, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been\ndiscouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am\nwriting.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I\nbelieve, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large\nnumber of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all\nthat makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say\nthat they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing\nnumber.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of\nthe small per cent.It may not be\nknown how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in\nthe meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a\nstore, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic\nphysicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no\nreason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who\nhave quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,\nstarted out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was\npointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath\nfrom the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance\nbill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a\nchain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,\nabout eight hundred of them, of \"mossbacks,\" as we were politely called.I\nsay \"we,\" for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the\nnames of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could\nbe had with them.Just for what, aside\nfrom the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not\nclear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,\nand do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals\nare continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the\n\"Who's Who in Osteopathy\" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is\nnot strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic\njournals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those\nwho choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students\nshould know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational\n    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in Exact Proportion to Advertising\n    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous\n    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine\n    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic\n    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of\n    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The\n    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as \"Professor\"--The Lure of\n    \"Honored Doctor\" with \"Big Income\"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in\npopularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them\nintelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to\nfollow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and\npopularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing\nsystem.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people\nare so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The \"perfect\nadjustment,\" \"perfect functioning\" theory of Osteopathy is especially\nattractive to people made ripe for some \"drugless healing\" system by\ncauses already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of\nall manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative\npowers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such\ngood results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will\nestablish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and\nholds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,\ntaught as \"a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,\"\nhas grown and spread largely as a \"patent medicine\" flourishes, _i.e._,\nin exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not\npresume to make this statement as merely my opinion.The question at issue\nis too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present\nfacts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.Every week I get booklets or \"sample copies\" of journals heralding the\nwonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as\njournals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by\nthe hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution\nby these patients to their friends.The publishers of these \"boosters\"\nsay, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their\npractice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of\nthese journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:\n\n    \"Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me\n    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite\n    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their\n    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter\nopposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it\nbecause \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\"At one time I honestly\nbelieved this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic\nauthority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract\nfrom a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic\nAssociation:\n\n    \"Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at\n    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of\n    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our\n    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which\n    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe\n    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its\n    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized\n    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._\n    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your\n    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your\n    own limitations_?\"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we\nhave boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: \"Curbing our\nlimitations\" and \"sounding your own limitations.\"But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body \"_our\ndeath knell begins to sound_,\" indicate that Osteopathic leaders are\ncontent to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science\ndepends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he\nsaid, \"Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of\nOsteopathy as an independent system\"?If truth always grows under\npersecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when\nit is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where\nthey have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of\ninvalids every day.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic\njournals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends\nupon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was\ndemonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the\nbenefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its\nmerits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly\na _name_, and \"lives, moves, and has its being\" in boosting?It seems to\nhave been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have\npublished again and again the nice things a number of governors said when\nthey signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State\nauthority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a\nchampion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.Mark Twain once went\nup to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to\nresist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed\nMark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned\nhistory of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a\nchampion of the \"under dog in the fight.\"Lately he has gone on the\nwarpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond\ndelusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll\nSouthern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and\nboldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have\ntossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to\nbe promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his \"Heart's Desire.\"There may have been \"method in his madness,\" for that Osteopathic horse\ndoctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam\nsaid, \"There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as\nbetween playing a piano and currying a horse.\"The idea of comparing the\nOsteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the\npianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that\npreachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors\nwhen they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.They can be excused on\nthe ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of \"struggling\ntruth.\"But what shall we say of medical men, some of them of reputation\nand great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such\nconditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or\npolicy?Osteopathic journals have made much of an article written by a famous\n\"orificial surgeon.\"The article appears on the first page of a leading\nOsteopath journal, and is headed, \"An Expert Opinion on Osteopathy.\"Among\nthe many good things he says of the \"new science\" is this: \"The full\nbenefit of a single sitting can be secured in from three to ten minutes\ninstead of an hour or more, as required by massage.\"I shall discuss the\ntime of an average Osteopathic treatment further on, but I should like to\nsee how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath\nand treated from three to ten minutes.He also says that \"Osteopathy is so beneficial to cases of insanity that\nit seems quite probable that this large class of terrible sufferers may be\nalmost emancipated from their hell.\"I shall also say more further on of\nwhat I know of Osteopathy's record as an insanity cure.There is this\nsignificant thing in connection with this noted specialist's boost for\nOsteopathy.The journal printing this article comments on it in another\nnumber; tells what a great man the specialist is, and incidentally lets\nOsteopaths know that if any of them want to add a knowledge of \"orificial\nsurgery\" to their \"complete science,\" this doctor is the man from whom to\nget it, as he is the \"great and only\" in his specialty, and is big and\nbroad enough to appreciate Osteopathy.The most despicable booster of any new system of therapeutics is the\nphysician who becomes its champion to get a job as \"professor\" in one of\nits colleges.Of course it is a strong temptation to a medical man who has\nnever made much of a reputation in his own profession.You may ask, \"Have there been many such medical men?\"Consult the faculty\nrolls of the colleges of these new sciences, and you will be surprised, no\ndoubt, to find how many put M.D.Some of these were honest converts to the system, perhaps.Some wanted\nthe honor of being \"Professor Doctor,\" maybe, and some may have been lured\nby the same bait that attracts so many students into Osteopathic colleges.That is, the positive assurance of \"plenty of easy money\" in it.One who has studied the real situation in an effort to learn why\nOsteopathy has grown so fast as a profession, can hardly miss the\nconclusion that advertising keeps the grist of students pouring into\nOsteopathic mills.There is scarcely a corner of the United States that\ntheir seductive literature does not reach.Practitioners in the field are\ncontinually reminded by the schools from which they graduated that their\nalma mater looks largely to their solicitations to keep up the supply of\nrecruits.Their advertising, the tales of wonderful cures and big money made, appeal\nto all classes.It seems that none are too scholarly and none too ignorant\nto become infatuated with the idea of becoming an \"honored doctor\" with a\n\"big income.\"College professors and preachers have been lured from\ncomfortable positions to become Osteopaths.Shrewd traveling men, seduced\nby the picture of a permanent home, have left the road to become\nOsteopathic physicians and be \"rich and honored.\"To me, when a student of Osteopathy, it was\npathetic and almost tragic to observe the crowds of men and women who had\nbeen seduced from spheres of drudging usefulness, such as clerking,\nteaching, barbering, etc., to become money-making doctors.In their old\ncallings they had lost all hope of gratifying ambition for fame and\nfortune, but were making an honest living.The rosy pictures of honor,\nfame and twenty dollars per day, that the numerous Osteopathic circulars\nand journals painted, were not to be withstood.These circulars told them that the fields into which they might go and\nreap that $20 per day were unlimited.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.They said: \"There are dozens of\nministers ready to occupy each vacant pulpit, and as many applicants for\neach vacancy in the schools.Each hamlet has four or five doctors, where\nit can support but one.The legal profession is filled to the starving\npoint.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.Young licentiates in the older professions all have to pass through\na starving time.The\npicture was a rosy dream of triumphant success!When they had mastered the\ngreat science and become \"Doctors of Osteopathy,\" the world was waiting\nwith open arms and pocketbooks to receive them.THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHY.Infallible, Touch-the-Button System that Always Cured--Indefinite\n    Movements and Manipulations--Wealth of Undeveloped Scientific\n    Facts--Osteopaths Taking M.D.Course--The Standpatter and the\n    Drifter--The \"Lesionist\"--\"Bone Setting\"--\"Inhibiting a\n    Center\"--Chiropractics--\"Finest Anatomists in the World\"--How to Cure\n    Torticollis, Goitre and Enteric Troubles--A Successful\n    Osteopath--Timid Old Maids--Osteopathic Philanthropy.Many of them were men and women\nwith gray heads, who had found themselves stranded at a time of life when\nthey should have been able to retire on a competency.They had staked\ntheir little all on this last venture, and what was before them if they\nshould fail heaven only knew.How eagerly they looked forward to the time\nwhen they should have struggled through the lessons in anatomy, chemistry,\nphysiology, symptomatology and all the rest, and should be ready to\nreceive the wonderful principles of Osteopathy they were to apply in\nperforming the miraculous cures that were to make them wealthy and famous.Need I tell the physician who was a conscientious student of anatomy in\nhis school days, that there was disappointment when the time came to enter\nthe class in \"theory and practice\" of Osteopathy?There had been vague ideas of a systematized, infallible, touch-the-button\nsystem that _always_ cured.Instead, we were instructed in a lot of\nindefinite movements and manipulations that somehow left us speculating as\nto just how much of it all was done for effect.We had heard so often that Osteopathy was a complete satisfying science\n_that did things specifically_!Now it began to dawn upon us that there\nwas indeed a \"wealth of undeveloped scientific facts\" in Osteopathy, as\nthose glittering circulars had said when they thought to attract young men\nambitious for original research.They had said, \"Much yet remains to be\ndiscovered.\"Some of us wondered if the \"undeveloped\" and \"undiscovered\"\nscientific facts were not the main constituents of the \"science.\"The students expected something exact and tangible, and how eagerly they\ngrasped at anything in the way of bringing quick results in curing the\nsick.If Osteopathy is so complete, why did so many students, after they had\nreceived everything the learned (?)professors had to impart, procure\nJuettner's \"Modern Physio-Therapy\" and Ling's \"Manual Therapy\" and Rosse's\n\"Cures Without Drugs\" and Kellogg's work on \"Hydrotherapy\"?They felt that\nthey needed all they could get.It was customary for the students to begin \"treating\" after they had been\nin school a few months, and medical men will hardly be surprised to know\nthat they worked with more faith in their healing powers and performed\nmore wonderful (?)cures in their freshman year than they ever did\nafterward.I have in mind a student, one of the brightest I ever met, who read a\ncheap book on Osteopathic practice, went into a community where he was\nunknown, and practiced as an Osteopathic physician.In a few months he had\nmade enough money to pay his way through an Osteopathic college, which he\nentered professing to believe that Osteopathy would cure all the ills\nflesh is heir to, but which he left two years later to take a medical\ncourse.degree, but I notice that it is his M.D.Can students be blamed for getting a little weak in faith when men who\ntold them that the great principles of Osteopathy were sufficient to cure\n_everything_, have been known to backslide so far as to go and take\nmedical courses themselves?How do you suppose it affects students of an Osteopathic college to read\nin a representative journal that the secretary of their school, and the\ngreatest of all its boosters, calls medical men into his own family when\nthere is sickness in it?There are many men and women practicing to-day who try to be honest and\nconscientious, and by using all the good in Osteopathy, massage, Swedish\nmovements, hydrotherapy, and all the rest of the adjuncts of\nphysio-therapy, do a great deal of good.The practitioner who does use\nthese agencies, however, is denounced by the stand-patters as a \"drifter.\"They say he is not a true Osteopath, but a mongrel who is belittling the\ngreat science.That circular letter from the secretary of the American\nOsteopathic Association said that one of the greatest needs of\norganization was to preserve Osteopathy in its primal purity as it came\nfrom its founder, A. T. Still.If our medical brethren and the laity could read some of the acrimonious\ndiscussions on the question of using adjuncts, they would certainly be\nimpressed with the exactness (?)There is one idea of Osteopathy that even the popular mind has grasped,\nand that is that it is essentially finding \"lesions\" and correcting them.Yet the question has been very prominent and pertinent among Osteopaths:\n\"Are you a lesion Osteopath?\"Think of it, gentlemen, asking an Osteopath\nif he is a \"lesionist\"!Yet there are plenty of Osteopaths who are stupid\nenough (or honest enough) not to be able to find bones \"subluxed\" every\ntime they look at a patient.Practitioners who really want to do their\npatrons good will use adjuncts even if they are denounced by the\nstand-patters.I believe every conscientious Osteopath must sometimes feel that it is\nsafer to use rational remedies than to rely on \"bone setting,\" or\n\"inhibiting a center,\" but for the grafter it is not so spectacular and\ninvolves more hard work.The stand-patters of the American Osteopathic Association have not\neliminated all trouble when they get Osteopaths to stick to the \"bone\nsetting, inhibiting\" idea.The chiropractic man threatens to steal their\nthunder here.The Chiropractor has found that when it comes to using\nmysterious maneuvers and manipulations as bases for mind cure, one thing\nis about as good as another, except that the more mysterious a thing\nlooks the better it works.So the Chiropractor simply gives his healing\n\"thrusts\" or his wonderful \"adjustments,\" touches the buttons along the\nspine as it were, when--presto!disease has flown before his healing touch\nand blessed health has come to reign instead!The Osteopath denounces the Chiropractor as a brazen fraud who has stolen\nall that is good in Chiropractics (if there _is_ anything good) from\nOsteopathy.But Chiropractics follows so closely what the \"old liner\"\ncalls the true theory of Osteopathy that, between him and the drifter who\ngives an hour of crude massage, or uses the forbidden accessories, the\ntrue Osteopath has a hard time maintaining the dignity (?)of Osteopathy\nand keeping its practitioners from drifting.Some of the most ardent supporters of true Osteopathy I have ever known\nhave drifted entirely away from it.After practicing two or three years,\nabusing medicine and medical men all the time, and proclaiming to the\npeople continually that they had in Osteopathy", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "He has\n\"silently folded his tent and stolen away,\" and where has he gone?He has\ngone to a medical college to study that same medicine he has so\nindustriously abused while he was gathering in the shekels as an\nOsteopath.Going to learn and practice the science he has so persistently\ndenounced as a fraud and a curse to humanity.The intelligent, conscientious Osteopath who dares to brave the scorn of\nthe stand-patter and use all the legitimate adjuncts of Osteopathy found\nin physio-therapy, may do a great deal of good as a physician.I have\nfound many physicians willing to acknowledge this, and even recommend the\nservices of such an Osteopath when physio-therapy was indicated.When a physician, however, meets a fellow who claims to have in his\nOsteopathy a wonderful system, complete and all-sufficient to cope with\nany and all diseases, and that his system is founded on a knowledge of the\nrelation and function of the various parts and organs of the body such as\nno other school of therapeutics has ever been able to discover, then he\nknows that he has met a man of the same mental and moral calibre as the\nshyster in his own school.He knows he has met a fellow who is exploiting\na thing, that may be good in its way and place, as a graft.And he knows\nthat this grafter gets his wonderful cures largely as any other quack gets\nhis; the primary effects of his \"scientific manipulations\" are on the\nminds of those treated.The intelligent physician knows that the Osteopath got his boastedly\nsuperior knowledge of anatomy mostly from the same text-books and same\nclass of cadavers that other physicians had to master if they graduated\nfrom a reputable school.All that talk we have heard so much about the\nOsteopaths being the \"finest anatomists in the world\" sounds plausible,\nand is believed by the laity generally.The quotation I gave above has been much used in Osteopathic literature\nas coming from an eminent medical man.What foundation is there for such a\nbelief?The Osteopath _may_ be a good anatomist.He has about the same\nopportunities to learn anatomy the medical student has.If he is a good\nand conscientious student he may consider his anatomy of more importance\nthan does the medical student who is not expecting to do much surgery.If\nhe is a natural shyster and shirk he can get through a course in\nOsteopathy and get his diploma, and this diploma may be about the only\nproof he could ever give that he is a \"superior anatomist.\"Great stress has always been laid by Osteopaths upon the amount of study\nand research done by their students on the cadaver.I want to give you\nsome specimens of the learning of the man (an M.D.)who presided over the\ndissecting-room when I pursued my \"profound research\" on the \"lateral\nhalf.\"This great man, whose superior knowledge of anatomy, I presume,\ninduced by the wise management of the college to employ him as a\ndemonstrator, in an article written for the organ of the school expresses\nhimself thus:\n\n    \"It is needless to say that the first impression of an M. D. would not\n    be favorable to Osteopathy, because he has spent years fixing in his\n    mind that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it, but\n    give a man morphine or something of the same character with an\n    external blister or hot application and in a week or ten days he would\n    be all right.In the meanwhile watch the patient's general health,\n    relieve the induced constipation by suitable means and rearrange what\n    he has disarranged in his treatment.On the other hand, let the\n    Osteopath get hold of this patient, and with his _vast_ and we might\n    say _perfect_ knowledge of anatomy, he at once, with no other tools\n    than his hands, inhibits the nerves supplying the affected parts, and\n    in five minutes the patient can freely move his head and shoulders,\n    entirely relieved from pain.Would\n    he not feel like wiping off the earth with all the Osteopaths?Doctor,\n    with your medical education a course in Osteopathy would teach you\n    that it is not necessary to subject your patients to myxedema by\n    removing the thyroid gland to cure goitre.You would not have to lie\n    awake nights studying means to stop one of those troublesome bowel\n    complaints in children, nor to insist upon the enforced diet in\n    chronic diarrhea, and a thousand other things which are purely\n    physiological and are not done by any magical presto change, but by\n    methods which are perfectly rational if you will only listen long\n    enough to have them explained to you.I will agree that at first\n    impression all methods look alike to the medical man, but when\n    explained by an intelligent teacher they will bring their just\n    reward.\"Gentlemen of the medical profession, study the above\ncarefully--punctuation, composition, profound wisdom and all.Surely you\ndid not read it when it was given to the world a few years ago, or you\nwould all have been converted to Osteopathy then, and the medical\nprofession left desolate.We have heard many bad things of medical men,\nbut never (until we learned it from one who was big-brained enough to\naccept Osteopathy when its great truths dawned upon him) did we know that\nyou are so dull of intellect that it takes you \"years to fix in your minds\nthat if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it but to give a\nman morphine.\"Almost before he knew, he found himself seated\nputting together a little song; a sweet tune offered itself for it;\nand while his heart was strangely full of gentle feelings, the tune\nwent and came till words linked themselves to it and begged to be\nsung, if only for once.He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:\n\n   \"He went in the forest the whole day long,\n    The whole day long;\n    For there he had heard such a wondrous song,\n    A wondrous song.\"He fashioned a flute from a willow spray,\n    A willow spray,\n    To see if within it the sweet tune lay,\n    The sweet tune lay.\"It whispered and told him its name at last,\n    Its name at last;\n    But then, while he listened, away it passed,\n    Away it passed.\"But oft when he slumbered, again it stole,\n    Again it stole,\n    With touches of love upon his soul,\n    Upon his soul.\"Then he tried to catch it, and keep it fast,\n    And keep it fast;\n    But he woke, and away i' the night it passed,\n    I' the night it passed.\"'My Lord, let me pass in the night, I pray,\n    In the night, I pray;\n    For the tune has taken my heart away,\n    My heart away.'\"Then answered the Lord, 'It is thy friend,\n    It is thy friend,\n    Though not for an hour shall thy longing end,\n    Thy longing end;\n\n   \"'And all the others are nothing to thee,\n    Nothing to thee,\n    To this that thou seekest and never shalt see,\n    Never shalt see.'\"\"Good bye,\" said Margit at the Clergyman's door.It was a Sunday\nevening in advancing summer-time; the Clergyman had returned from\nchurch, and Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was\nseven o'clock.\"Good bye, Margit,\" said the Clergyman.She hurried\ndown the door-steps and into the yard; for she had seen Eli Boeen\nplaying there with her brother and the Clergyman's son.\"Good evening,\" said Margit, stopping; \"and God bless you all.\"She blushed crimson and wanted to leave\noff the game; the boys begged her to keep on, but she persuaded them\nto let her go for that evening.\"I almost think I know you,\" said Margit.you're Eli Boeen; yes, now I see you're like your mother.\"Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down over her neck\nand shoulders; she was hot and as red as a cherry, her bosom\nfluttered up and down, and she could scarcely speak, but laughed\nbecause she was so out of breath.\"Well, young folks should be merry,\" said Margit, feeling happy as\nshe looked at her.\"P'r'aps you don't know me?\"If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably have asked her\nname, but now she only said she did not remember having seen her\nbefore.\"No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.But my son, p'r'aps\nyou know a little--Arne Kampen; I'm his mother,\" said Margit, with a\nstolen glance at Eli, who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly.\"I'm pretty sure he worked at Boeen once.\"\"It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning, and got it in\nbefore I came away; it's good weather indeed for everything.\"\"There will be a good hay-harvest this year,\" Eli suggested.\"Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on well at Boeen, I\nsuppose?\"\"Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well, and they have\nplenty of help.\"Couldn't you go a little way with me?I so seldom have anybody to\ntalk to; and it will be all the same to you, I suppose?\"Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on.\"Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time of seeing\nanybody; but one must put up with old folks' ways.\"Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket first.It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened looked like a\ndress with a bodice; but now she fastened only two of the lower\nhooks, because she was so hot.Her fine linen bodice had a little\nturned-down collar, and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape\nof a bird with spread wings.Just such a one, Nils, the tailor, wore\nthe first time Margit danced with him.\"A pretty stud,\" she said, looking at it.\"Ah, I thought so,\" Margit said, helping her with the jacket.The hay was lying in heaps; and\nMargit took up a handful, smelled it, and thought it was very good.She asked about the cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask\nalso about the live stock at Boeen, and then she told how much they\nhad at Kampen.\"The farm has improved very much these last few years,\nand it can still be made twice as large.He keeps twelve milch-cows\nnow, and he could keep several more, but he reads so many books and\nmanages according to them, and so he will have the cows fed in such a\nfirst-rate way.\"Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and Margit then\nasked her age.Not much, I dare say--you look so\nspruce.\"Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late.\"Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything; when\none gets a large house of one's own, there's a great deal to be done.But, of course, when one finds good help already in the house before\nher, why, it doesn't matter so much.\"Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone a long way beyond\nthe grounds of the parsonage.\"It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind it you would\nchat a little longer with me.\"Then Margit began to talk about Arne.\"I don't know if you know much\nof him.He could teach you something about everything, he could; dear\nme, what a deal he has read!\"Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal.\"Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said of him; but\nthe way he has behaved to his mother all his days, that's something\nmore, that is.If the old saying is true, that he who's good to his\nmother is good to his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to\ncomplain of.\"Eli asked why they had painted the house before them with grey paint.\"Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne may sometime be\nrewarded for all his kindness to his mother.When he has a wife, she\nought to be kind-hearted as well as a good scholar.I think of a many things, you may be sure, while I sit\nalone in yonder wood.If ever he takes home a wife who brings\nblessings to house and man, then I know many a poor soul will be glad\nthat day.\"They were both silent, and walked on without looking at each other;\nbut soon Eli stopped.\"One of my shoe-strings has come down.\"Margit waited a long while till at last the string was tied.\"He has such queer ways,\" she began again; \"he got cowed while he was\na child, and so he has got into the way of thinking over everything\nby himself, and those sort of folks haven't courage to come forward.\"Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that\nKampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and that Eli\nmust see it, as too she was so near.But Eli thought it would be late\nthat day.\"There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home.\"\"No, no,\" Eli answered quickly, and would go back.\"Arne's not at home, it's true,\" said Margit; \"but there's sure to be\nsomebody else about;\" and Eli had now less objection to it.\"If only I shall not be too late,\" she said.\"Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it, it may be too\nlate, I dare say.\"\"Being brought up at the\nClergyman's, you've read a great deal, I dare say?\"\"It'll be of good use when you have a husband who knows less.\"No; that, Eli thought she would never have.\"Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing; but still\nfolks about here haven't much learning.\"Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight before her.\"No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood; when we come\nfarther up you'll see Kampen.It's a pleasant place to live at, is\nKampen, you may be sure; it seems a little out of the way, it's true;\nbut that doesn't matter much, after all.\"Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the wood.\"It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to Kampen: a man named\nOpplands-Knut lives there.He went about lonely till Arne gave him\nthat piece of land to clear.he knows what it is to be\nlonely.\"Soon they came far enough to see Kampen.\"Yes, it is,\" said the mother; and she, too, stood still.The sun\nshone full in their faces, and they shaded their eyes as they looked\ndown over the plain.In the middle of it stood the red-painted house\nwith its white window-frames; rich green cornfields lay between the\npale new-mown meadows, where some of the hay was already set in\nstacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the cows, sheep\nand goats were coming home; their bells tinkled, the dogs barked, and\nthe milkmaids called; while high above all, rose the grand tune of\nthe waterfall from the ravine.The farther Eli went, the more this\nfilled her ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it\nwhizzed and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,\nand she became bewildered and dizzy, and then felt so subdued that\nshe unconsciously began to walk with such small timid steps that\nMargit begged her to come on a little faster.\"I never\nheard anything like that fall,\" she said; \"I'm quite frightened.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.\"You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even miss it.\"\"Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle,\" she said, turning\ndownwards from the road, into the path.\"Those trees on each side,\nNils planted; he wanted to have everything nice, did Nils; and so\ndoes Arne; look, there's the garden he has laid out.\"exclaimed Eli, going quickly towards the garden\nfence.\"We'll look at that by-and-by,\" said Margit; \"now we must go over to\nlook at the creatures before they're locked in--\" But Eli did not\nhear, for all her mind was turned to the garden.She stood looking\nat it till Margit called her once more; as she came along, she gave a\nfurtive glance through the windows; but she could see no one inside.They both went upon the barn steps and looked down at the cows, as\nthey passed lowing into the cattle-house.Margit named them one by\none to Eli, and told her how much milk each gave, and which would\ncalve in the summer, and which would not.The sheep were counted and\npenned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised from two lambs\nwhich Arne had got from the South.\"He aims at all such things,\" said\nMargit, \"though one wouldn't think it of him.\"Then they went into\nthe barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in, and Eli\nhad to smell it; \"for such hay isn't to be found everywhere,\" Margit\nsaid.She pointed from the barn-hatch to the fields, and told what\nkind of seed was sown on them, and how much of each kind.\"No less\nthan three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year, they're\nset with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground; over there, too,\nthe land's new-cleared, but I suppose that soil's different, for\nthere he has sown barley; but then he has strewed burnt turf over it\nfor manure, for he attends to all such things.Well, she that comes\nhere will find things in good order, I'm sure.\"Now they went out\ntowards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered nothing to all\nthat Margit had told her about other things, when they passed the\ngarden asked if she might go into it; and when she got leave to go,\nshe begged to pick a flower or two.Away in one corner was a little\ngarden-seat; she went over and sat down upon it--perhaps only to try\nit, for she rose directly.\"Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late,\" said Margit, as\nshe stood at the house-door.Margit asked if Eli\nwould not take some refreshment, as this was the first time she had\nbeen at Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused.Then they\nlooked round the room, which was the one Arne and the mother\ngenerally used in the day-time; it was not very large, but cosy and\npleasant, with windows looking out on the road.There were a clock\nand a stove; and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but\nwith new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to Arne, English\nfishing-tackle and other rare things, which the mother took down and\nshowed to Eli, who looked at them and touched them.The room was\nwithout painting, for this Arne did not like; neither was there any\nin the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine, with the\ngreen mountains on the other side, and the blue peaks in the\nbackground.But the two smaller rooms in the wing were both painted;\nfor in them the mother would live when she became old, and Arne\nbrought a wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting, and\nso in these rooms the ceilings were painted with roses, and her name\nwas painted on the cupboards, the bedsteads, and on all reasonable\nand unreasonable places; for it was Arne himself who had done it.They went into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house; and\nnow they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms; \"all the best\nthings were there,\" the mother said.These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with those below, but\nthey were new and not yet taken into use, save one which looked\ntowards the ravine.In them hung and stood all sorts of household\nthings not in every-day use.Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and\nother bedclothes; and the mother took hold of them and lifted them;\nso did Eli, who looked at all of them with pleasure, examined some of\nthem twice, and asked questions about them, growing all the while\nmore interested.\"Now we'll find the key of Arne's room,\" said the mother, taking it\nfrom under a chest where it was hidden.They went into the room; it\nlooked towards the ravine; and once more the awful booming of the\nwaterfall met their ears, for the window was open.They could see the\nspray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself, save in one\nplace farther up, where a huge fragment of rock had fallen into it\njust where the torrent came in full force to take its last leap into\nthe depths below.The upper side of this fragment was covered with\nfresh sod; and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and had\ngrown up to trees, rooted into the crevices.The wind had shaken and\ntwisted them; and the fall had dashed against them, so that they had\nnot a sprig lower than eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled\nand bent; yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.When\nEli looked out from the window, these trees first caught her eye;\nnext, she saw the snowy peaks rising far beyond behind the green\nmountains.Then her eyes passed over the quiet fertile fields back to\nthe room; and the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed the\nClergyman had more.Beneath it was a cupboard, where Arne kept his\nmoney.The mother said money had been left to them twice already, and\nif everything went right they would have some more.\"But, after all,\nmoney's not the best thing in the world; he may get what's better\nstill,\" she added.There were many little things in the cupboard which were amusing to\nsee, and Eli looked at them all, happy as a child.Then the mother\nshowed her a large chest where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too,\nwere taken out and looked at.\"I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so fond of you,\nmy child,\" she said, looking affectionately into her eyes.Eli had\nscarcely time to feel a little bashful, before Margit pulled her by\nthe hand and said in a low voice, \"Look at that little red chest;\nthere's something very choice in that, you may be sure.\"Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square one, which she\nthought she would very much like to have.\"He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest,\" the mother\nwhispered; \"and he always hides the key.\"She went to some clothes\nthat hung on the wall, took down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the\npocket, and there found the key.\"Now come and look,\" she whispered; and they went gently, and knelt\ndown before the chest.As soon as the mother opened it, so sweet an\nodor met them that Eli clapped her hands even before she had seen\nanything.On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother\ntook away.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.\"Here, look,\" she whispered, taking out a fine black\nsilk neckerchief such as men do not wear.\"It looks just as if it\nwas meant for a girl,\" the mother said.Eli spread it upon her lap\nand looked at it, but did not say a word.\"Here's one more,\" the\nmother said.Eli could not help taking it up; and then the mother\ninsisted upon trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her\nhead down.She did not know what she would not have given for such a\nneckerchief; but she thought of something more than that.They\nfolded them up again, but slowly.\"Now, look here,\" the mother said, taking out some handsome ribands.\"Everything seems as if it was for a girl.\"Eli blushed crimson, but\nshe said nothing.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"There's some more things yet,\" said the mother,\ntaking out some fine black cloth for a dress; \"it's fine, I dare\nsay,\" she added, holding it up to the light.Eli's hands trembled,\nher chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to her head, and she\nwould fain have turned away, but that she could not well do.\"He has bought something every time he has been to town,\" continued\nthe mother.Eli could scarcely bear it any longer; she looked from\none thing to another in the chest, and then again at the cloth, and\nher face burned.The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in\npaper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of shoes.Anything\nlike them, they had never seen, and the mother wondered how they\ncould be made.Eli said nothing; but when she touched the shoes her\nfingers left warm marks on them.\"I'm hot, I think,\" she whispered.\"Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all, one after\nanother, for somebody he was afraid to give them to?\"\"He has kept them here in this chest--so long.\"She\nlaid them all in the chest again, just as they were before.\"Now\nwe'll see what's here in the compartment,\" she said, opening the lid\ncarefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something specially\nbeautiful.When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a waistband, next,\ntwo gold rings tied together, and a hymn-book bound in velvet and\nwith silver clasps; but then she saw nothing more, for on the silver\nof the book she had seen graven in small letters, \"Eli Baardsdatter\nBoeen.\"The mother wished her to look at something else; she got no answer,\nbut saw tear after tear dropping down upon the silk neckerchief and\nspreading over it.She put down the _sylgje_[5] which she had in her\nhand, shut the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her.Then the\ndaughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept over her, without\neither of them saying any more.[5] _Sylgje_, a peculiar kind of brooch worn in Norway.--Translators.*       *       *       *       *\n\nA little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden, while the\nmother was in the kitchen preparing something nice for supper; for\nnow Arne would soon be at home.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.Then she came out in the garden to\nEli, who sat tracing names on the sand with a stick.When she saw\nMargit, she smoothed the sand down over them, looked up and smiled;\nbut she had been weeping.\"There's nothing to cry about, my child,\" said Margit, caressing her;\n\"supper's ready now; and here comes Arne,\" she added, as a black\nfigure appeared on the road between the shrubs.Eli stole in, and the mother followed her.The supper-table was\nnicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream porridge; Eli did not\nlook at it, however, but went away to a corner near the clock and sat\ndown on a chair close to the wall, trembling at every sound.Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,\nand a short, light step in the passage, the door was gently opened,\nand Arne came in.The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left hold on the\ndoor and stood still.This made Eli feel yet more confused; she rose,\nbut then felt sorry she had done so, and turned aside towards the\nwall.She held her hand before her face, as one does when the sun shines\ninto the eyes.She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards him, but\nthen bent her head and burst into tears.She did not answer,\nbut wept still more.She leant\nher head upon his breast, and he whispered something down to her; she\ndid not answer, but clasped her hands round his neck.They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was heard, save\nthat of the fall which still gave its eternal warning, though distant\nand subdued.Then some one over against the table was heard weeping;\nArne looked up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till\nthen.\"Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me, Arne,\" she said,\ncoming across the floor to him; and she wept much, but it did her\ngood, she said.*       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, when they had supped and said good-bye to the mother, Eli and\nArne walked together along the road to the parsonage.It was one of\nthose light summer nights when all things seem to whisper and crowd\ntogether, as if in fear.Even he who has from childhood been\naccustomed to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them, and\ngoes about as if expecting something to happen: light is there, but\nnot life.Often the sky is tinged with blood-red, and looks out\nbetween the pale clouds like an eye that has watched.One seems to\nhear a whispering all around, but it comes only from one's own brain,\nwhich is over-excited.Man shrinks, feels his own littleness, and\nthinks of his God.Those two who were walking here also kept close to each other; they\nfelt as if they had too much happiness, and they feared it might be\ntaken from them.\"I can hardly believe it,\" Arne said.\"I feel almost the same,\" said Eli, looking dreamily before her.\"_Yet it's true_,\" he said, laying stress on each word; \"now I am no\nlonger going about only thinking; for once I have done something.\"He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not gladly.\"No, it\nwas not I,\" he said; \"it was mother who did it.\"He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a while he said,\n\"Up to this day I have done nothing; not taken my part in anything.He went on a little farther, and then said warmly, \"God be thanked\nthat I have got through in this way;... now people will not have to\nsee many things which would not have been as they ought....\" Then\nafter a while he added, \"But if some one had not helped me, perhaps I\nshould have gone on alone for ever.\"\"What do you think father will say, dear?\"asked Eli, who had been\nbusy with her own thoughts.\"I am going over to Boeen early to-morrow morning,\" said\nArne;--\"_that_, at any rate, I must do myself,\" he added, determining\nhe would now be cheerful and brave, and never think of sad things\nagain; no, never!\"And, Eli, it was you who found my song in the\nnut-wood?\"\"And the tune I had made it for, you got hold\nof, too.\"\"I took the one which suited it,\" she said, looking down.He smiled\njoyfully and bent his face down to hers.she asked looking up....\n\n\"Eli... you mustn't be angry with me... but one day this spring...\nyes, I couldn't help it, I heard you singing on the parsonage-hill.\"She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed.\"Then, after all,\nyou have been served just right,\" she said.\"Well--it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your mother... well\n... another time....\"\n\n\"Nay; tell it me now.\"She would not;--then he stopped and exclaimed, \"Surely, you haven't\nbeen up-stairs?\"He was so grave that she felt frightened, and looked\ndown.\"Mother has perhaps found the key to that little chest?\"She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as if only to keep\nback her tears; then he laid his arm round her neck and drew her\nstill closer to him.He trembled, lights seemed flickering before his\neyes, his head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers, but\ncould hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his arm, and turned\naside, afraid to look at her.The clouds had taken such strange\nshapes; there was one straight before him which looked like a goat\nwith two great horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was\nthe nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there was the\npicture of a big man, which was set slantwise, and then was suddenly\nrent.... But just over the mountain the sky was blue and clear; the\ncliff stood gloomy, while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to\nmove; pale and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the\nwood went down to it, full of love just as before.Some birds woke\nand twittered half in sleep; answers came over from one copse and\nthen from another, but there was no danger at hand, and they slept\nonce more... there was peace all around.Arne felt its blessedness\nlying over him as it lay over the evening.he said, so that he heard the words\nhimself, and he folded his hands, but went a little before Eli that\nshe might not see it.It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was being carried.It\nwas a bright day; there had been rain in the night and earlier in\nmorning, but now the air was clear and mild as in summer-time.It was\nSaturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water towards\nthe church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves, sat rowing, while\nthe women, with light- kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the\nstern and the forepart.But still more boats were steering towards\nBoeen, in readiness to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard\nBoeen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne Nilsson Kampen.The doors were all open, people went in and out, children with pieces\nof cake in their hands stood in the yard, fidgety about their new\nclo", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "She\nwore a large silver ring, with several small rings fastened to the\nupper plate; and now and then she looked at it: Nils gave it her on\ntheir wedding-day, and she had never worn it since.The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men--the\nClergyman's son and Eli's brother--went about in the rooms offering\nrefreshments to the wedding-guests as they arrived.Up-stairs in\nEli's room, were the Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who\nhad come from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,\nfor this they had promised each other from childhood.Arne was\ndressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black hat, and a collar\nthat Eli had made; and he was in one of the down-stairs rooms,\nstanding at the window where she wrote \"Arne.\"It was open, and he\nleant upon the sill, looking away over the calm water towards the\ndistant bight and the church.Outside in the passage, two met as they came from doing their part in\nthe day's duties.The one came from the stepping-stones on the shore,\nwhere he had been arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black\njacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which the dye\ncame, making his hands blue; his white collar looked well against his\nfair face and long light hair; his high forehead was calm, and a\nquiet smile lay round his lips.She whom he met had\njust come from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church.She was\ntall and upright, and came through the door somewhat hurriedly, but\nwith a firm step; when she met Baard she stopped, and her mouth drew\nto one side.Each had something to say to\nthe other, but neither could find words for it.Baard was even more\nembarrassed than she; he smiled more and more, and at last turned\ntowards the staircase, saying as he began to step up, \"Perhaps you'll\ncome too.\"Here, up-stairs, was no one but\nthemselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he was a long\nwhile about it.When at last he turned round, Birgit stood looking\nout from the window, perhaps to avoid looking in the room.Baard took\nfrom his breast-pocket a little silver cup, and a little bottle of\nwine, and poured out some for her.But she would not take any, though\nhe told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent them.Then he drank\nsome himself, but offered it to her several times while he was\ndrinking.He corked the bottle, put it again into his pocket with the\ncup, and sat down on a chest.He breathed deeply several times, looked down and said, \"I'm so\nhappy-to-day; and I thought I must speak freely with you; it's a long\nwhile since I did so.\"Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.Baard went\non, \"I've been thinking about Nils, the tailor, to-day; he separated\nus two; I thought it wouldn't go beyond our wedding, but it has gone\nfarther.To-day, a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken\ninto our family, and we have given him our only daughter.What now,\nif we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again, and keep it so\nthat we can never more be separated?\"His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough.Birgit laid her head\ndown upon her arm, but said nothing.Baard waited long, but he got no\nanswer, and he had himself nothing more to say.He looked up and grew\nvery pale, for she did not even turn her head.At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door, and a soft voice\nasked, \"Are you coming now, mother?\"Birgit raised her\nhead, and, looking towards the door, she saw Baard's pale face.\"Yes, now I am coming,\" said Birgit in a broken voice, while she gave\nher hand to Baard, and burst into a violent flood of tears.The two hands pressed each other; they were both toilworn now, but\nthey clasped as firmly as if they had sought each other for twenty\nyears.They were still locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to\nthe door; and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the\nstepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to Eli, Baard\nlooked at them, and, against all custom, took Birgit by the hand and\nfollowed them with a bright smile.But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.Baard was quite overjoyed that day.While he was talking with the\nrowers, one of them, who sat looking at the mountains behind, said\nhow strange it was that even such a steep cliff could be clad.\"Ah,\nwhether it wishes to be, or not, it must,\" said Baard, looking all\nalong the train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife.\"Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?\"Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by John Wilson & Son.THE\nCHILDREN'S GARLAND\n\nFROM THE BEST POETS\n\nSELECTED AND ARRANGED\nBY COVENTRY PATMORE\n\n16mo.\"It includes specimens of all the great masters in the art of Poetry,\nselected with the matured judgment of a man concentrated on obtaining\ninsight into the feelings and tastes of childhood, and desirous to\nawaken its finest impulses, to cultivate its keenest sensibilities.\"CINCINNATI GAZETTE.\"The University Press at Cambridge has turned out many wonderful\nspecimens of the art, but in exquisite finish it has never equalled\nthe evidence of its skill which now lies before us.The text,\ncompared with the average specimens of modern books, shines out with\nas bright a contrast as an Elzevir by the side of one of its dingy\nand bleared contemporaries.In the quality of its paper, in its\nvignettes and head-pieces, the size of its pages, in every feature\nthat can gratify the eye, indeed, the 'Garland' could hardly bear\nimprovement.Similar in its general getting up to the much-admired\nGolden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics, issued by the same\npublishers a few months since, it excels, we think, in the perfection\nof various minor details.\"\"It is a beautiful book,--the most beautiful in some respects that\nhas been published for years;

but he soon broke off\nnegotiations.'Papineau,' wrote Robert Nelson, 'has abandoned us, and\nthis through selfish and family motives regarding the seigniories, and\ninveterate love of the old French bad laws.'There is reason to\nbelieve, however, that Papineau had been in communication with the\nauthorities at Washington, and that his desertion of Robert Nelson and\nCote was in reality due to his discovery that President Van Buren was\nnot ready to depart from his attitude of neutrality.On February 28, 1838, Robert Nelson and Cote had crossed the border\nwith an armed force of French-Canadian refugees and three small\nfield-pieces.Their plan had contemplated the capture of Montreal and\na junction with another invading force at Three Rivers.But on finding\ntheir way barred by the Missisquoi militia, they had beat a hasty\nretreat to the border, without fighting; and had there been disarmed by\nthe American {119} troops under General Wool, a brave and able officer\nwho had fought with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of Queenston\nHeights in 1812.During the summer months, however, the refugees had continued to lay\nplans for an insurrection in Lower Canada.Emissaries had been\nconstantly moving among the parishes north of the New York and Vermont\nfrontiers, promising the _Patriotes_ arms and supplies and men from the\nUnited States.And when November\ncame large bodies of disaffected habitants gathered at St Ours, St\nCharles, St Michel, L'Acadie, Chateauguay, and Beauharnois.They had\napparently been led to expect that they would be met at some of these\nplaces by American sympathizers with arms and supplies.No such aid\nbeing found at the rendezvous, many returned to their homes.But some\npersevered in the movement, and made their way with packs on their\nbacks to Napierville, a town fifteen miles north of the boundary-line,\nwhich had been designated as the rebel headquarters.Meanwhile, Robert Nelson had moved northward to Napierville from the\nAmerican side of the border with a small band of refugees.{120} Among\nthese were two French officers, named Hindenlang and Touvrey, who had\nbeen inveigled into joining the expedition.Hindenlang, who afterwards\npaid for his folly with his life, has left an interesting account of\nwhat happened.He and Touvrey joined Nelson at St Albans, on the west\nside of Lake Champlain.With two hundred and fifty muskets, which had\nbeen placed in a boat by an American sympathizer, they dropped down the\nriver to the Canadian border.There were five in the party--Nelson and\nthe two French officers, the guide, and the boatman.Nelson had given\nHindenlang to understand that the habitants had risen and that he would\nbe greeted at the Canadian border by a large force of enthusiastic\nrecruits.'There was not a\nsingle man to receive the famous President of the _Provisional\nGovernment_; and it was only after a full hour's search, and much\ntrouble, [that] the guide returned with five or six men to land the\narms.'On the morning of November 4 the party arrived at Napierville.Here Hindenlang found Dr Cote already at the head of two or three\nhundred men.A crowd speedily gathered, and Robert Nelson was\nproclaimed 'President of the Republic of {121} Lower Canada.'Hindenlang and Touvrey were presented to the crowd; and to his great\nastonishment Hindenlang was informed that his rank in the rebel force\nwas that of brigadier-general.The first two or three days were spent in hastening the arrival of\nreinforcements and in gathering arms.By the 7th Nelson had collected\na force of about twenty-five hundred men, whom Hindenlang told off in\ncompanies and divisions.Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks\nand pikes.An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to\nobtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of\nCaughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow\nhad discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result\nthat the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the\nattack and taken seventy prisoners.On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men\nsouth to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and\nammunition from the American sympathizers.On his way south Cote\nencountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at\nLacolle, and drove it {122} in.On his return journey, however, he met\nwith greater opposition.The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in\nthe meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford.As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a\nbrisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove\nthem from the field.Without further ado the rebels fled across the\nborder, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as\nwell as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used\nin the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of\nball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.Of the provincial troops two\nwere killed and one was severely wounded.The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of\ncommunications with his base on the American frontier was cut.At the\nsame time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on\nNapierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and\nvolunteers.Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on\nOdelltown, just north of the border.He had with him about a thousand\nmen, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets.{123} He arrived\nat Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about\ntwo hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting\nfield-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor.He had no\ndifficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself\nproved a harder nut to crack.Taylor had concentrated his little force\nat the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by\nmeans of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three\ndays before at Lacolle.The insurgents extended through the fields to\nthe right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from\nbehind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range.'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang;\n'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow,\npraying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many\nsaints, hewn in stone.Many remained in that posture as long as the\nfighting lasted.'The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men\nhad been intimidated into joining the rebel force.The engagement\nlasted in all about two hours and a half.The defenders of the church\nmade several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were\nbeginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the\nRichelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture.The\nrebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang.Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch\nand rode for the American border.The losses of the rebels were\nserious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many\nwounded.Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and\none officer and eight men wounded.Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable\nforce, entered Napierville.On his approach those rebels who were\nstill in the village dispersed and fled to their homes.Detachments of\ntroops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported\nto be still under arms.The only encounter took place at Beauharnois,\nwhere a large body of insurgents had assembled.After a slight\nresistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry\nvolunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of\nRoyal Engineers.In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers,\ndid a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}\nBeauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,\nincluding the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the\nintimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected\nby the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in\nthese regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But\nno excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'\nburned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's\nsecond-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old\nFirebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for\nincendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear\nthat he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the\noffenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.It was a venture\ncriminally hopeless.Failing important aid from the United States, the\nrebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year\nbefore, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had\nbeen considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for\nthe rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}\nthe critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to\nextricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which\nhe had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the\nrebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the\nhands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred\nwere brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them\nbeing Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the\nprisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of\ntrial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their\nfunctions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially\nconvened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer\nHindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the\nothers were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is\nworthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been\npersons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it\nmust be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord\nDurham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some\n{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And\nthe execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in\nthe revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on\nthe part of the government.{128}\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA POSTSCRIPT\n\nThe rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_\nand the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present\ngeneration has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which\ninspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an\nimpartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to\nrecognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend\nthat many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal\nin their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their\nmethods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_\nleaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and\nduring it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants\nthey had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be\nproud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only\npersons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the\nFrench-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to\nliberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like\nRobert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote\nBouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for\nwhich some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an\norganized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are\ninherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be\ndenied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however\nremote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and\nliberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget\nthat in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of\nCanada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they\nhave been made free.[Illustration: Denis Benjamin Viger.From a print in M'Gill University\nLibrary.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this\nlittle book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying\nfortunes.Robert Nelson took\nup his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his\ndeath in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there\nemployed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of\nvolumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents\nrelating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes\nwhich are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on\nCanadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him\nfor his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual\namnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin\nadministration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many\nof the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion\nand who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and\nprominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte\nLaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and\nafter having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the\nparliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the\nadministration which ushered in full responsible government, and was\nknighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}\nof the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in\nhiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin\nadministration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at\nSt Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was\nmade a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his\npractice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of\nparliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an\ninspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,\ntook up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by\nCanadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a\nhalfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at\nMoore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs\nat Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of\nexile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red\nrepublicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.He entered\nthe Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he\nproved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things\nunder responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,\nwho had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The\ntruth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself\nrealized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when\nexplaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an\nopposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay\nnot in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave\nto those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the\nfoundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti\nRouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the\n_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and\ndignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at\nMontebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old\nantagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare\noccasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came\nto Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver\nan address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which\nmay be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe\nme, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside\nmay differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I\nfeel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And\ncharity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nThe story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of\nthe general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of\nCanada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias\nagainst the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and\ninteresting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents\nthe history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with\nsympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is\nRobert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_\n(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the\npre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of\noriginal material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of\nmention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its\ncomplete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,\n_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion\nwritten by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion\nde 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in\nthe loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord\nCharles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada\nunder Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the\nvalue of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the\nintroduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in\nCanada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military\noperations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point\nof view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_\n(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the\nrebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North\nAmerica_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,\n_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;\nas does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_\n(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'\nseries; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of\nDurham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be\nfound to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the\nrebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local\nhistorical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state\ntrials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;\nexhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_\n(1839).{136}\n\nINDEX\n\nAssembly, the language question in the, 8-12; racial conflict over form\nof taxation, 13-14; the struggle with Executive for full control of\nrevenue leads to deadlock, 22-5, 27, 29-30, 53-4, 57; seeks redress in\nImperial parliament, 28-32; the Ninety-Two Resolutions, 38-42; the\ngrievance commission, 45-6, 52, 55-6; the Russell Resolutions, 57-61.Aylmer, Lord, governor of Canada, 29, 33-4, 44, 45.Beauharnois, Patriotes defeated at, 124-5.Bedard, Elzear, introduces the Ninety-Two Resolutions, 38, 42;\nsuspended as a judge, 126.Bedard, Pierre, and French-Canadian nationalism, 11, 15, 16; his arrest\nand release, 17-19, 20.Bidwell, M.

Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE\n\n\nThe \"Aeroplane Glide\" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed\nto represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its\nname from that fact.The sole difference between the \"Dip\" and \"Aeroplane\" consists in the\nsix running steps which make up the first two measures.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Of these running\nsteps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before\nand behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure\nrequires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is\nnoticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the \"Dip\".[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TANGO\n\n\nThe Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the\npeculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends\nlargely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the\nmusic as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,\nand the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend\nthemselves most readily to verbal description.1\n\nThe partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes\nthe lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full\nextent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand\nupon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration\nopposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and\nsteps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows\nforward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing\none foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same\ndirection.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the\nwhole is repeated at will.2\n\nThis variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman\ntakes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two\nsteps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two\nsteps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as\nthe feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the\nwhole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE \"BOSTON\"\n\n\nPIANO SOLO\n\n(_Also to be had for Full or Small Orchestra_)\n\nLOVE'S AWAKENING           _J.Danglas_       .60\nON THE WINGS OF DREAM      _J.Danglas_       .60\nFRISSON (Thrill!)Sinibaldi_     .50\nLOVE'S TRIUMPH             _A.Daniele_       .60\nDOUCEMENT                  _G.Robert_        .60\nVIENNOISE                  _A.Duval_         .60\n\nThese selected numbers have attained success, not alone for their\nattractions of melody and rich harmony, but for their rhythmical\nflexibility and perfect adaptedness to the \"Boston.\"FOR THE TURKEY TROT\n\nEspecially recommended\n\nTHE GOBBLER                _J.Monroe_        .50\n\n\nAny of the foregoing compositions will be supplied on receipt of\none-half the list price.PUBLISHED BY\n\nTHE BOSTON MUSIC COMPANY 26 & 28 WEST ST., BOSTON, MASS.TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\n\n\n  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.Let the\nprotection of a closed gate be of value to cities when besieged;

her tongue was restrained\nby timid apprehensions.But still her silent features pronounced my\ncensure; by her tears _and_ by her silent lips did she convict me.First could I wish that my arms had fallen from off my shoulders; to\nbetter purpose could I have parted with a portion of myself.To my own\ndisadvantage had I the strength of a madman; and for my own punishment\ndid I stoutly exert my strength.What do I want with you, ye ministers\nof death and criminality?Impious hands, submit to the chains, your due.Should I not have been punished had I struck the humblest Roman [085]\nof the multitude?_And_ shall I have a greater privilege against my\nmistress?The son of Tydeus has left the worst instance of crime: he was\nthe first to strike a Goddess, [086] I, the second.But less guilty\nwas he; by me, she, whom I asserted to be loved _by me_, was injured;\nagainst an enemy the son of Tydeus was infuriate.Come now, conqueror, prepare your boastful triumphs; bind your locks\nwith laurel, and pay your vows to Jove, and let the multitude, the\ntrain, that escorts your chariot, shout aloud, \"Io _triumphe!_ by\n_this_ valiant man has the fair been conquered!\"Let the captive, in her\nsadness, go before with dishevelled locks, pale all over, if her hurt\ncheeks [087] may allow.In short, if, after the manner of a swelling torrent, I was impelled,\nand if impetuous anger did make me its prey;

just as when the breeze waves the foliage of the\npoplars; just as the slender reed quivers with the gentle Zephyr; or,\nas when the surface of the waves is skimmed by the warm South wind.Her\ntears, too, so long repressed, flowed down her face, just as the water\nflows from the snow when heaped up.Then, for the first time, did I begin to be sensible that I was guilty;\nthe tears which she was shedding were _as_ my own blood.Yet, thrice\nwas I ready, suppliantly to throw myself before her feet; thrice did\nshe repel my dreaded hands.But, _dearest,_ do not you hesitate, (_for_\nrevenge will lessen your grief) at once to attack my face with your\nnails.Spare not my eyes, nor _yet_ my hair; let anger nerve your hands,\nweak though they may be.And that tokens so shocking of my criminality may no longer exist, put\nyour locks, arranged anew, in their proper order._He curses a certain procuress, whom he overhears instructing his\nmistress in the arts of a courtesan._\n\n|There is a certain--(whoever wishes to make acquaintance with a\nprocuress, let him listen.)--There is a certain old hag, Dipsas by name.From fact does she derive [094] her name;

when she wills it, the day is bright\nwith a clear atmosphere.I have beheld (if I may be believed) the stars dripping with blood:\nthe face of the moon was empurpled [099] with gore.I believe that she,\ntransformed, [101] was flying amid the shades of night, and that her\nhag's carcase was covered with feathers._This_ I believe, and such is\nthe report.A double pupil, too, [102] sparkles in her eyes, and light\nproceeds from a twofold eyeball.Forth from the ancient sepulchres she\ncalls our great grandsires, and their grandsires [103] as well; and with\nher long incantations she cleaves the solid ground.She has made it her\noccupation to violate the chaste bed; and besides, her tongue is not\n\"wanting in guilty advocacy.Chance made me the witness of her language;\nin such words was she giving her advice;

let him\nfancy he is loved; but have you a care that this affection is not all\nfor nothing.Often refuse your favours; sometimes pretend a head-ache;\nand sometimes there will be Isis [121] to afford a pretext._But_ soon\nadmit him again; that he may acquire no habits of endurance, and that\nhis love, so often repulsed, may not begin to flag.Let your door be\ndeaf to him who entreats, open to him who brings.Let the lover that is\nadmitted, hear the remarks of him who is excluded.And, as though you\nwere the first injured, sometimes get in a passion with him when injured\n_by you_.His censure, when counterbalanced by your censure, [127] may\nwear away.But do you never afford a long duration for anger; prolonged\nanger frequently produces hatred.Moreover, let your eyes learn, at\ndiscretion, to shed tears; and let this cause or that cause your cheeks\nto be wet.And do not, if you deceive any one, hesitate to be guilty of\nperjury;

love is not very lasting if you remove _all_ rivalry.Let him perceive the traces of _another_ person on the couch; all your\nneck, too, discoloured by the marks of toying.Especially let him see\nthe presents, which another has sent.If he gives you nothing, the\nSacred Street [133] must be talked about.When you have received many\nthings, but yet he has not given you every thing, be continually asking\nhim to lend you something, for you never to return.Let your tongue aid\nyou, and let it conceal your thoughts;

believe me,\nAtticus, [138] every lover is a soldier.The age which is fitted for\nwar, is suited to love as well.For an old man to be a soldier, is\nshocking; amorousness in an old man is shocking.The years which [139]\ngenerals require in the valiant soldier, the same does the charming fair\nrequire in her husband.Both _soldier and lover_ pass sleepless nights;\nboth rest upon the ground.The one watches at the door of his mistress;\nbut the other _at that_ of his general.[140] Long marches are the duty\nof the soldier; send the fair _far_ away, _and_ the lover will boldly\nfollow her, without a limit _to his endurance_.Over opposing mountains\nwill he go, and rivers swollen with rains; the accumulating snows will\nhe pace.About to plough the waves, he will not reproach the stormy East winds;\nnor will he watch for Constellations favourable for scudding over the\nwaves.Who, except either the soldier or the lover, will submit to both\nthe chill of the night, and the snows mingled with the heavy showers?The one is sent as a spy against the hostile foe; the other keeps\nhis eye on his rival, as though upon an enemy.The one lays siege to\nstubborn cities, the other to the threshold of his obdurate mistress:\nthe one bursts open gates, and the other, doors.[142] Full oft has it\nanswered to attack the enemy when buried in sleep; and to slaughter an\nunarmed multitude with armed hand.Thus did the fierce troops of the\nThracian Rhesus [143] fall; and you, captured steeds, forsook your lord.Full oft do lovers take advantage of the sleep of husbands, and brandish\ntheir arms against the slumbering foe.To escape the troops of the\nsentinels, and the bands of the patrol, is the part _both_ of the\nsoldier, and of the lover always in misery.Mars is wayward, and Venus\nis uncertain; both the conquered rise again, and those fall whom you\nwould say could never possibly be prostrate.Whoever, then, has pronounced Love _mere_ slothfulness, let him cease\n_to love_: [144] to the discerning mind does Love belong.The mighty\nAchilles is inflamed by the captive Briseis.Trojans, while you may,\ndestroy the Argive resources.Hector used to go to battle _fresh_ from\nthe embraces of Andromache; and it was his wife who placed his helmet on\nhis head.The son of Atreus, the first of _all_ the chiefs, on beholding\nthe daughter of Priam, is said to have been smitten with the dishevelled\nlocks of the raving _prophetess_.[146] Mars, too, when caught, was\nsensible of the chains wrought at the forge; [147] there was no story\nbetter known than his, in all the heavens.I myself was of slothful habit, and born for a lazy inactivity; [148]\nthe couch and the shade [149] had enervated my mind.Attentions to the\ncharming fair gave a fillip to me, in my indolence; and _Love_ commanded\nme to serve [150] in his camp.Hence it is that thou seest me active,\nand waging the warfare by night.Let him who wishes not to become\nslothful, fall in love._He tells his mistress that she ought not to require presents as a\nreturn for her love._\n\n|Such as she, who, borne away from the Eurotas, [151] in the Phrygian\nships, was the cause of warfare to her two husbands; such as Leda was,\nwhom her crafty paramour, concealed in his white feathers, deceived\nunder _the form of_ a fictitious bird; such as Amymone [152] used to\nwander in the parched _fields of_ Argos, when the urn was pressing the\nlocks on the top of her head; such were you; and I was in dread of both\nthe eagle and the bull with respect to you, and whatever _form besides_\nLove has created of the mighty Jove.Now, all fears are gone, and the disease of my mind is cured; and now no\nlonger does that form _of yours_ rivet my eyes.This reason does not\nallow of your pleasing me.So long as you were disinterested, I was in\nlove with your mind together with your person; now, _in my estimation_\nyour appearance is affected by this blemish on your disposition.Love is\nboth a child and naked; he has years without sordidness, and _he wears_\nno clothes, that he may be without concealment.Why do you require the\nson of Venus to be prostituted at a price?He has no fold in his dress,\n[153] in which to conceal that price.Neither Venus is suited for cruel\narms, nor yet the son of Venus; it befits not such unwarlike Divinities\nto serve for pay.The courtesan stands for hire to any one at a certain\nprice; and with her submissive body, she seeks for wretched pelf.Still,\nshe curses the tyranny of the avaricious procurer; [154] and she does by\ncompulsion [155] what you are doing of your own free will.Take, as an example, the cattle, devoid of reason; it were a shocking\nthing for there to be a finer feeling in the brutes.The mare asks no\ngift of the horse, nor the cow of the bull; the ram does not woo the\newe, induced by presents.Woman alone takes pleasure in spoils torn\nfrom the man; she alone lets out her nights; alone is she on sale, to be\nhired at a price.She sells, too, _joys_ that delight them both, _and_\nwhich both covet; and she makes it a _matter_ of pay, at what price she\nherself is to be gratified.Those joys, which are so equally sweet to\nboth, why does the one sell, and _why_ the other buy them?Why must that\ndelight prove a loss to me, to you a gain, for which the female and the\nmale combine with kindred impulse?Witnesses hired dishonestly, [156]\nsell their perjuries; the chest [157] of the commissioned judge [158] is\ndisgracefully open _for the bribe_.'Tis a dishonourable thing to defend the wretched criminals with a\ntongue that is purchased; [159] 'tis a disgrace for a tribunal to\nmake great acquisitions.'Tis a disgrace for a woman to increase\nher patrimonial possessions by the profits of her embraces, and to\nprostitute her beauty for lucre.Thanks are _justly_ due for things\nobtained without purchase; there are no thanks for an intercourse\ndisgracefully bartered.He who hires, [160] pays all _his due_; the\nprice _once_ paid, he no longer remains a debtor for your acquiescence.Cease, ye beauties, to bargain for pay for your favours.Sordid gains\nbring no good results.It was not worth her while to bargain for the\nSabine bracelets, [161] in order that the arms should crush the head of\nthe sacred maiden.The son pierced [163] with the sword those entrails\nfrom which he had sprung, and a simple necklace [164] was the cause of\nthe punishment.But yet it is not unbecoming for a present to be asked of the wealthy\nman; he has something to give to her who does ask for a present.Pluck\nthe grapes that hang from the loaded vines; let the fruitful soil of\nAlcinous [165] afford the apples.Let the needy man proffer duty, zeal,\nand fidelity; what each one possesses, let him bestow it all upon his\nmistress.My endowments, too, are in my lines to shig the praises of\nthose fair who deserve them; she, whom I choose, becomes celebrated\nthrough my skill.Vestments will rend, gems and gold will spoil; the\nfame which poesy confers is everlasting._Still_ I do not detest giving and revolt at it, but at being asked for\na price.Cease to demand it, _and_ I will give you that which I refuse\nyou while you ask._He begs Nape to deliver his letter to her mistress, and commences by\npraising her neatness and dexterity, and the interest she has hitherto\nmanifested in his behalf._\n\n|Nape, skilled at binding the straggling locks [166] and arranging\nthem in order, and not deserving to be reckoned [167] among the\nfemale slaves; _known_, too, _by experience_ to be successful in the\ncontrivances of the stealthy night, and clever in giving the signals;\n[168] you who have so oft entreated Corinna, when hesitating, to come to\nme; who have been found so often faithful by me in my difficulties; take\nand carry these tablets, [169] so well-filled, [170] this morning\nto your mistress; and by your diligence dispel _all_ impeding delay.Neither veins of flint, nor hard iron is in your breast, nor have you a\nsimplicity greater than that of your _clever_ class.There is no doubt\nthat you, too, have experienced the bow of Cupid; in my behalf defend\nthe banner of your service.If _Corinna_ asks what I am doing, you will\nsay that I am living in expectation of the night.The wax inscribed with\nmy persuasive hand is carrying the rest.While I am speaking, time is flying; opportunely give her my tablets,\nwhen she is at leisure; but still, make her read them at once.I bid you\nwatch her eyes and her forehead as she reads; from the silent features\nwe may know the future.And _be there_ no delay;

\"and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute\nI'll have a look at my boys.\"exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in\nfront of the bedroom door.Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air.\"I'll not WAKE them,\" persisted Alfred, \"I just wish to have a LOOK at\nthem,\" and with that he again made a move toward the door.\"But Alfred,\" protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, \"you're not\ngoing to leave me again--so soon.\"Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of\ntheir persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way\nof over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively.\"I'll bring the boys in here and you can\nboth have a look at them.\"\"But Aggie,\" argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, \"would\nit be wise to wake them?\"\"Now you stay here and I'll get them.\"Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door\nhad closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished\nhis temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room\nwith a new air of proprietorship.\"This is certainly a great night, Zoie,\" he said.\"It certainly is,\" acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made\nAlfred turn to her with new concern.\"I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear,\" he said.Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that\nmoment, there came a sharp ring at the door.Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had\nadvanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on\nhis breast.\"You ARE jumpy,\" said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud\nvoices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall.asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's\nfrantic embrace.Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert\near caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute\nin the hallway.cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about\nhim.CHAPTER XXVII\n\nPropelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted\ncollar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer\ndoor.\"Let go of me,\" shouted the hapless Jimmy.The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a\nlarge burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the\nreluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him.\"I got him for you, sir,\" announced the officer proudly, to the\nastonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to\nstruggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to\nthe bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer\nand pressed him jealously to his breast.\"I don't understand,\" he said,\ngazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate\nJimmy.\"I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.\"\"I KNEW it,\" exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at\nJimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred\nturned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing\ndefiance into the officer's threatening eyes.This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out\ninto the night.\"\"Then you've had trouble with him before?\"He\nstudied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought\na confirmed \"baby-snatcher\" to justice.\"I've had a little trouble myself,\" declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved\nto make a clean breast of it.\"I'm not asking about your troubles,\" interrupted the officer savagely,\nand Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on\nhis collar.\"Go ahead, sir,\" said the officer to Alfred.\"Well,\" began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, \"he was out\nwith my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him\na second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the\nfire-escape.I don't know what to say,\" he finished weakly.\"_I_ do,\" exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,\n\"and I'll say it.\"And before Jimmy could get further,\nAlfred resumed with fresh vehemence.\"He's supposed to be a friend of mine,\" he explained to the officer, as\nhe nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy.\"He was all right when I left him\na few months ago.\"\"You'll think I'm all right again,\" shouted Jimmy, trying to get free\nfrom the officer, \"before I've finished telling all I----\"\n\n\"That won't help any,\" interrupted the officer firmly, and with another\ntwist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most\ncivil manner, \"What shall I do with him, sir?\"\"I don't know,\" said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject\nfor a straight jacket.\"It's absurd,\" cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter\ndespair of ever disentangling the present complication without\nultimately losing Alfred, \"you're all absurd,\" she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, \"what do you\nmean?\"\"It's a joke,\" said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke\nlay.\"If you had any sense you could see it.\"\"I DON'T see it,\" said Alfred, with hurt dignity.\"Neither do I,\" said Jimmy, with boiling resentment.\"Can you call it a joke,\" asked Alfred, incredulously, \"to have our\nboy----\" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion\npiece to this youngster.he exclaimed, \"our other\nboy----\" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified\nface to Zoie.\"Now, Alfred,\" pleaded Zoie, \"don't get excited; he's all right.\"Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as\nusual he was the source of an inspiration for her.\"Jimmy never cared for the other one,\" she said, \"did you, Jimmy?\"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command.\"Wait,\" he said,\nthen he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other\nboy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair\nstraight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's\nreturn with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to\nappear on the threshold with one babe on each arm.\"Here they are,\" she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight\nof the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied\nhand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,\n\"THOSE aren't MINE,\" he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better\nto say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,\nwhose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and\nshe proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her.\"OURS, dear,\" she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and\nfeeling sure that his mind was about to give way.\"Why--why--why,\" stuttered Zoie, \"THAT'S the JOKE.\"echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but\nsuch.\"Yes,\" added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their\ntemporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, \"what IS there to tell?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.\"Why, you see,\" said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each\nelaboration of Zoie's lie, \"we didn't dare to break it to you too\nsuddenly.\"gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on\nhis face.\"So,\" concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, \"we\nasked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT.\"Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible\nthat she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?\"Yes,\" confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, \"we wanted you to get used\nto the idea gradually.\"He was afraid to allow his mind to accept\ntoo suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy\nover-power him.\"You--you--do--don't mean----\" he stuttered.\"Yes, dear,\" sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a\nlanguid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight.\"Give\nthem to me,\" he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants\nsavagely from her arms.\"Give me ALL of them, ALL of them.\"He clasped\nthe three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the\nunsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to\nhers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her\nunmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his\nheart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind\nin general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated\nthat bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which\nJimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled\nJimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a\nloud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young\nfriend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred\nveered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in\ntime to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young\nfather.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred\nsuddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other.\"Well,\" said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,\nand feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his\nshort-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, \"if this is all a\njoke, I'll let the woman go.\"\"The woman,\" repeated Alfred; \"what woman?\"\"I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape,\" explained the\nofficer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly.\"I thought\nshe might be an accomplice.\"His manner was\nbecoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of\neach new infant.\"Don't be silly, Alfred,\" snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was\nmaking such an idiot of himself.\"Oh, that's it,\" said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; \"the\nnurse, then she's in the joke too?\"\"You're all in it,\" he exclaimed, flattered to think\nthat they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many\nof them to deceive him.\"Yes,\" assented Jimmy sadly, \"we are all 'in it.'\"\"Well, she's a great actress,\" decided Alfred, with the air of a\nconnoisseur.\"She sure is,\" admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt\nhis reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him.\"She put up a\nphoney story about the kid being hers,\" he added.\"But I could tell she\nwasn't on the level.Good-night, sir,\" he called to Alfred, and ignoring\nJimmy, he passed quickly from the room.I'll\nbe down later and fix things up with you.\"Again Alfred gave his whole\nattention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed\necstatically into the three small faces below his.\"Much too much,\" agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the\ncouch in his customary attitude of gloom.\"You were right not to break it to me too suddenly,\" said Alfred, and\nwith his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch\nby Jimmy's side.\"You're a cute one,\" he continued to Jimmy, who was\nedging away from the three mites with aversion.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.In the absence of any\nanswer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, \"Isn't he a cute one, dear?\"\"Oh, yes, VERY,\" answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at\nself restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.\"If you women are done with me,\" he said, \"I'll clear out.\"exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "\"What a chance,\" and he laughed\nboisterously.\"You're not going to get out of my sight this night,\" he\ndeclared.\"I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.\"\"So am I,\" assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot\nwhere his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted.\"A man needs someone around,\" he declared, \"when he's going through a\nthing like this.I need all of you, all of you,\" and with his eyes he\nembraced the weary circle of faces about him.\"I feel as though I could\ngo out of my head,\" he explained and with that he began tucking the\nthree small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'\n\n\"You act as though you WERE out of your head,\" she commented, but Alfred\ndid not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing\nthree babies to sleep with one lullaby.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show\nsome resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again\nsimultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII\n\nAnnoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,\nAlfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into\nthe room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly\nfor the side of Zoie's bed.\"If you plaze, mum,\" she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her\nhands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.\"'Scuse me for comin' right in\"--Maggie was breathing hard--\"but me\nmother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from\nwork, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum.\"cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward\nAlfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing\ninterest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, \"your father is mad about babies?\"\"It's all right, dear,\" interrupted Zoie nervously; \"you see,\" she\nwent on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, \"this is our\nwasherwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it\nmade the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.\"\"Oh,\" said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so\neasily disposed of.\"If you please, mum,\" she objected, \"it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that\nall his heirs were boys, \"No wonder your pa's angry.Come now,\" he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and\nregarding her indulgently, \"you go straight home and tell your father\nthat what HE needs is BOYS.\"\"Well, of course, sir,\" answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that\nAlfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her\nparents, \"if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money\nback,\" and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel\npetticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, \"what money?\"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly.\"The money for the wash, dear,\" she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, \"who talks\nof money at such a time as this?\"And taking a ten dollar bill from his\npocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying\nto return to him the original purchase money.\"Here,\" he said to the\nastonished girl, \"you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to\nhim for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it.\"This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,\nor at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was\nadding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,\nbut she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such\na \"grand 'hoigh\" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no\ndoubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred\nundecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand.\"I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir,\" she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her\nred little fingers over the bill, \"he's GOT to like it.Now you run along,\" he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her\ntoward the door, \"and tell him what I say.\"\"Yes, sir,\" murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly\nunder Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high\nbacked chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's\nbeing able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,\nJimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their\nway with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into\nspace.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing\nbecame laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of\nMaggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the\nside of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his\near.\"Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,\nsir.\"He studied the young person at his\nelbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had\nhappened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently\nMaggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy\nthought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand\nfall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy\nbegan to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the\nharder.\"Go away,\" whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he\nsaid, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,\nAlfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the\nprompt answer that came from her direction.\"The wash, dear,\" said Zoie to Alfred; \"Jimmy had to go after the wash,\"\nand then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to\nstop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, \"You needn't wait, Maggie; we\nunderstand.\"\"Sure, an' it's more 'an I do,\" answered Maggie, and shaking her head\nsadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of\nMaggie's inhuman parent.\"Just fancy,\" he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, \"fancy\nany man not liking to be the father of twins,\" and with that he again\nbent over the cradle and surveyed its contents.\"Think, Jimmy,\" he said,\nwhen he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, \"just think\nof the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.\"\"And then think of the way _I_ feel,\" grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; \"what have you to feel about?\"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a\ncrash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; \"nonsense!Here,\" he said, turning to Jimmy, \"you hold the boys and I'll go\nsee----\" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust\nupon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his\narms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,\nstrained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had\nstrode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked\nat Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining\nroom.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy\nbegan to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could\nscarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the\nbedroom door.\"She's come up the fire-escape,\" cried Aggie; \"she's beating Alfred to\ndeath.\"shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets.\"She's locking him in the bathroom,\" declared Aggie, and with that she\ndisappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of\nAggie.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.\"Wait a minute,\" called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find\na satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and\nhumanity.\"Eat 'em,\" was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her\nnegligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX\n\nNow, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this\ncommotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which\nhad been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly\nunprepared for the flying advent of Maggie.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.\"Oh, plaze, sir,\" she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward\nthe babes in Jimmy's arms, \"me fadder's coming right behind me.He's\na-lookin' for you sir.\"\"For me,\" murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth\nseemed to be looking for HIM.\"Put 'em down, sir,\" cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,\n\"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to\nturn.\"There,\" said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very\neyes.\"Of course,\" said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to\nlet the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that\ndisconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the\ncradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He\nlooked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made\na determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head\nthrough the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between\nO'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided\nto take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he\nstreaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that\nhe met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of\nthe Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,\nwavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself\non the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the\nrailing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's\nadvice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted\ninto the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,\ntrembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room.\"Lave go of me,\" cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a\nvain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for\nthe bed.\"Ah,\" he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object\nbeneath the covers, \"there you are, mum,\" and he shook his fist above\nwhat he believed to be the cowardly Mrs.\"'Tis well ye may cover\nup your head,\" said he, \"for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,\nbut when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'\n'em too.Then getting no response from the\nagitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in\nastonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but\nthree \"barren.\"\"They're child stalers, that's what they are,\" he declared to Maggie,\nas he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast.\"Me\nlittle Biddy,\" he crooned over his much coveted possession.\"Me little\nNorah,\" he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his\nnarrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled\nhis wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now\nsemi-quiet comforter.\"The black heart of ye, mum,\" he roared, then ordering Maggie to give\nback \"every penny of that shameless creetur's money\" he turned toward\nthe door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in\nhis denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman\nrushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,\nshe laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced\nher.she asked, then peering into\nthe face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed\nmoan.She scanned the face of the second\ninfant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother\nof the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the\ncradle.\"I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there,\" he said.Then\nbidding Maggie to \"git along out o' this\" and shrugging his shoulders\nto convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept\nquickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,\nthe Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when\nZoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother.\"How dare\nyou lock my husband in the bathroom?\"She pointed to the key, which the\nwoman still unconsciously clasped in her hand.\"Give me that key,\" she\ndemanded, \"give it to me this instant.\"\"Take your horrid old key,\" said the mother, and she threw it on the\nfloor.\"If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in\nJAIL,\" and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took\nher welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had\njust returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go\nto the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the\nbathroom door and demanding his instant release.\"I'll let him out,\" said Aggie.\"You get into bed,\" and she slipped\nquickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet\nand slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something\nrough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing\nagainst which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited\nbed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room\nemitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that\ndirection seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped\nin the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague\nfeeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all\nknowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion\nwas thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,\nand swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the\nupper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,\nawaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal\nhad transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and\nhe had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the\ntime he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a\nbabel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his\nshell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie\nbefore her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that\nthe pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,\nAggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend.\"You imagined it, Zoie,\" she declared, \"look for yourself.\"Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway.\"Well, perhaps I did,\" she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the\nroom, \"my nerves are jumping like fizzy water.\"They were soon to \"jump\" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with\nanger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered\nthe room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who\nhad dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly\nabout the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly\nacquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib.\"All,\" insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy\nrecollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,\nbut what had become of the other two?\"I don't know,\" said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that\nnight, \"I left them with Jimmy.\"shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, \"then he's at it again.And\nwith that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on\nhis face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and\npatted her shoulder condescendingly.\"Control yourself, my dear,\" he said.\"Control yourself; I'll get\nyour babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then,\" he added with\nparting emphasis from the doorway, \"I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!\"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie\nwere engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By\nuncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action\nfor him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for\nthe details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was\nwell covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the\nbedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly\nbeheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws\nwriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful\ncreature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting\ninto Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX\n\nHaving dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie\nwas bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred\nreturned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were\nthree infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical\nItalian woman, and last of all, Maggie.\"Bring them all in here, officer,\" called Alfred over his shoulder.\"I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are.\"Then turning to Aggie,\nwho stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,\n\"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.\"\"She's fainted,\" said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young\nwife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie\nand began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within\nhim, \"You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over\nZoie.\"Rouse yourself, my dear,\" he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up\nindignation.\"I'll let you know when I want to hear from you,\" snarled the officer to\nO'Flarety.\"But they're NOT her babies,\" protested the Italian woman desperately.\"Cut it,\" shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged\nparents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she\nregained her senses.\"Your babies are all right,\" he assured her.\"I've\nbrought them all back to you.\"gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been\nintervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking.\"Yes, dear,\" said Alfred, \"every one,\" and he pointed toward the three\ninfants in the officer's arms.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.\"I told you she'd be afraid to face us,\" shouted the now triumphant\nO'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, \"how dare you\npersecute this poor demented mother?\"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful\nItalian woman.\"She didn't persecute me, oh no!\"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and\nbegged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers.\"Let's hear her SAY it,\" demanded O'Flarety.\"You SHALL hear her,\" answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned\nto the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak.\"Sure,\" said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of\nZoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite\nher own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, \"take them\naway!\"This hateful reminder brought\nAlfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife.\"The excitement has unnerved her,\" he said to the officer.\"Ain't you about done with my kids?\"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any\nman with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a\n\"good payin' job.\"But Alfred's\nfaith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily\nshaken.\"My wife is in no condition to be questioned,\" he declared.\"She's out\nof her head, and if you don't----\"\n\nHe stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a\nsecond officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant\nJimmy.\"I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,\"\nhe called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a\nferocious expression.\"I caught him slipping down the fire-escape,\" explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach.\"Jimmy,\" said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes\nupon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast\nfailing faculties, \"you know the truth of this thing.You are the one\nwho sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a\nfather.\"asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected\nspouse.\"Of course I am,\" replied Alfred, with every confidence, \"but I have to\nprove it to the officer.Then turning to\nthe uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, \"Tell the\nofficer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am\nI not?\"\"If you're depending on ME for your future offspring,\" answered Jimmy,\nwagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, \"you\nare NOT a father.\"gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in\nbewilderment.\"Ask them,\" answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie.\"My darling,\"\nhe entreated, \"rouse yourself.\"\"Now,\" said\nAlfred, with enforced self-control, \"you must look the officer squarely\nin the eye and tell him whose babies those are,\" and he nodded toward\nthe officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the\nsubject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead.\"I only borrowed them,\" said Zoie, \"to get you home,\" and with that she\nsank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety.\"I guess they're your'n all right,\" admitted the officer doggedly, and\nhe grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents.\"I guess they'd better be,\" shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian\nwoman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist.\"If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.\"On your way,\" commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together\nwith Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy\nhousehold.he exclaimed; then he turned to\nJimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: \"If I'm not a\nfather, what am I?\"\"I'd hate to tell you,\" was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter\ndejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his\nhands.\"What shall I do with this one, sir?\"asked the officer, undecided as to\nJimmy's exact standing in the household.\"Shoot him, for all I care,\" groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to\ngo.\"No more of your funny business,\" said the officer with a parting nod at\nJimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises\nthat Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face\nagainst his round apoplectic cheek.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.And after all you\nhave done for us!\"\"Yes,\" sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to\nher feet, \"he's done a lot, hasn't he?\"And then forgetting that her\noriginal adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous\nresults was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,\n\"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his\nhorrid old luncheon.\"This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be\nwell out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was\nnow beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make\na clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most\ningratiating manner.\"Now, Alfred,\" she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about\nhis unsuspecting neck, \"if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL\nTRUTH.\"A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and\na determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily\ninterrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred\nthe real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another\nday, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment\nwas evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,\nup and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter\nof golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his\nample, well kept grounds.But if the same thing is far distant, the hand\nmust also be far removed from the body, and the face of the figure\npointing, must be turned towards those to whom he is pointing it out.CLXI./--_Of the Attitudes of the By-standers at some remarkable\nEvent._\n\n\n/All/ those who are present at some event deserving notice, express\ntheir admiration, but in various manners.As when the hand of justice\npunishes some malefactor.If the subject be an act of devotion, the\neyes of all present should be directed towards the object of their\nadoration, aided by a variety of pious actions with the other members;\nas at the elevation of the host at mass, and other similar ceremonies.If it be a laughable subject, or one exciting compassion and moving to\ntears, in those cases it will not be necessary for all to have their\neyes turned towards the object, but they will express their feelings\nby different actions; and let there be several assembled in groups, to\nrejoice or lament together.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.If the event be terrific, let the faces of\nthose who run away from the fight, be strongly expressive of fright,\nwith various motions; as shall be described in the tract on Motion.CLXII./--_How to represent Night._\n\n\n/Those/ objects which are entirely deprived of light, are lost to the\nsight, as in the night; therefore if you mean to paint a history under\nthose circumstances, you must suppose a large fire, and those objects\nthat are near it to be tinged with its colour, and the nearer they are\nthe more they will partake of it.The fire being red, all those objects\nwhich receive light from it will appear of a reddish colour, and\nthose that are most distant from it will partake of the darkness that\nsurrounds them.The figures which are represented before the fire will\nappear dark in proportion to the brightness of the fire, because those\nparts of them which we see, are tinged by that darkness of the night,\nand not by the light of the fire, which they intercept.Those that are\non either side of the fire, will be half in the shade of night, and\nhalf in the red light.Those seen beyond the extent of the flames,\nwill be all of a reddish light upon a black ground.In regard to their\nattitudes, let those who are nearest the fire, make screens of their\nhands and cloaks, against the scorching heat, with their faces turned\non the contrary side, as if ready to run away from it.The most remote\nwill only be shading their eyes with their hands, as if hurt by the too\ngreat glare.CLXIII./--_The Method of awakening the Mind to a Variety of\nInventions._\n\n\n/I will/ not omit to introduce among these precepts a new kind of\nspeculative invention, which though apparently trifling, and almost\nlaughable, is nevertheless of great utility in assisting the genius to\nfind variety for composition.By looking attentively at old and smeared walls, or stones and veined\nmarble of various colours, you may fancy that you see in them several\ncompositions, landscapes, battles, figures in quick motion, strange\ncountenances, and dresses, with an infinity of other objects.By these\nconfused lines the inventive genius is excited to new exertions.CLXIV./--_Of Composition in History._\n\n\n/When/ the painter has only a single figure to represent, he must avoid\nany shortening whatever, as well of any particular member, as of the\nwhole figure, because he would have to contend with the prejudices of\nthose who have no knowledge in that branch of the art.But in subjects\nof history, composed of many figures, shortenings may be introduced\nwith great propriety, nay, they are indispensable, and ought to be used\nwithout reserve, as the subject may require; particularly in battles,\nwhere of course many shortenings and contortions of figures happen,\namongst such an enraged multitude of actors, possessed, as it were, of\na brutal madness.CLXV./--_Of expressive Motions._\n\n\n/Let/ your figures have actions appropriated to what they are intended\nto think or say, and these will be well learnt by imitating the deaf,\nwho by the motion of their hands, eyes, eyebrows, and the whole body,\nendeavour to express the sentiments of their mind.Do not ridicule the\nthought of a master without a tongue teaching you an art he does not\nunderstand; he will do it better by his expressive motions, than all\nthe rest by their words and examples.Let then the painter, of whatever\nschool, attend well to this maxim, and apply it to the different\nqualities of the figures he represents, and to the nature of the\nsubject in which they are actors.CLXVI./--_How to paint Children._\n\n\n/Children/ are to be represented with quick and contorted motions,\nwhen they are sitting; but when standing, with fearful and timid\nmotions.CLXVII./--_How to represent old Men._\n\n\n/Old/ men must have slow and heavy motions; their legs and knees must\nbe bent when they are standing, and their feet placed parallel and wide\nasunder.Let them be bowed downwards, the head leaning much forward,\nand their arms very little extended.CLXVIII./--_How to paint old Women._\n\n\n/Old/ women, on the contrary, are to be represented bold and quick,\nwith passionate motions, like furies[33].But the motions are to appear\na great deal quicker in their arms than in their legs.CLXIX./--_How to paint Women._\n\n\n/Women/ are to be represented in modest and reserved attitudes, with\ntheir knees rather close, their arms drawing near each other, or folded\nabout the body; their heads looking downwards, and leaning a little on\none side.", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "CLXX./--_Of the Variety of Faces._\n\n\n/The/ countenances of your figures should be expressive of their\ndifferent situations: men at work, at rest, weeping, laughing, crying\nout, in fear, or joy, and the like.The attitudes also, and all the\nmembers, ought to correspond with the sentiment expressed in the faces.CLXXI./--_The Parts of the Face, and their Motions._\n\n\n/The/ motions of the different parts of the face, occasioned by sudden\nagitations of the mind, are many.The principal of these are, Laughter,\nWeeping, Calling out, Singing, either in a high or low pitch,\nAdmiration, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Pain, and others, of which\nI propose to treat.First, of Laughing and Weeping, which are very\nsimilar in the motion of the mouth, the cheeks, the shutting of the\neyebrows, and the space between them; as we shall explain in its place,\nin treating of the changes which happen in the face, hands, fingers,\nand all the other parts of the body, as they are affected by the\ndifferent emotions of the soul; the knowledge of which is absolutely\nnecessary to a painter, or else his figures may be said to be twice\ndead.But it is very necessary also that he be careful not to fall into\nthe contrary extreme; giving extraordinary motions to his figures, so\nthat in a quiet and peaceable subject, he does not seem to represent a\nbattle, or the revellings of drunken men: but, above all, the actors in\nany point of history must be attentive to what they are about, or to\nwhat is going forward; with actions that denote admiration, respect,\npain, suspicion, fear, and joy, according as the occasion, for which\nthey are brought together, may require.Endeavour that different points\nof history be not placed one above the other on the same canvass, nor\nwalls with different horizons[34], as if it were a jeweller's shop,\nshewing the goods in different square caskets.CLXXII./--_Laughing and Weeping._\n\n\n/Between/ the expression of laughter and that of weeping there is no\ndifference in the motion of the features either in the eyes, mouth,\nor cheeks; only in the ruffling of the brows, which is added when\nweeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing.One may represent\nthe figure weeping as tearing his clothes, or some other expression,\nas various as the cause of his feeling may be; because some weep\nfor anger, some through fear, others for tenderness and joy, or for\nsuspicion; some for real pain and torment; whilst others weep through\ncompassion, or regret at the loss of some friend and near relation.These different feelings will be expressed by some with marks of\ndespair, by others with moderation; some only shed tears, others cry\naloud, while another has his face turned towards heaven, with his\nhand depressed, and his fingers twisted.Some again will be full of\napprehension, with their shoulders raised up to their ears, and so on,\naccording to the above causes.Those who weep, raise the brows, and bring them close together above\nthe nose, forming many wrinkles on the forehead, and the corners of the\nmouth are turned downwards.Those who laugh have them turned upwards,\nand the brows open and extended.CLXXIII./--_Of Anger._\n\n\n/If/ you represent a man in a violent fit of anger, make him seize\nanother by the hair, holding his head writhed down against the ground,\nwith his knee fixed upon the ribs of his antagonist; his right arm up,\nand his fist ready to strike; his hair standing on end, his eyebrows\nlow and straight; his teeth close, and seen at the corner of the mouth;\nhis neck swelled, and his body covered in the Abdomen with creases,\noccasioned by his bending over his enemy, and the excess of his passion.CLXXIV./--_Despair._\n\n\n/The/ last act of despondency is, when a man is in the act of putting a\nperiod to his own existence.He should be represented with a knife in\none hand, with which he has already inflicted the wound, and tearing it\nopen with the other.He\nwill be standing with his feet asunder, his knees a little bent, and\nhis body leaning forward, as if ready to fall to the ground.CLXXV./--_The Course of Study to be pursued._\n\n\n/The/ student who is desirous of making great proficiency in the art\nof imitating the works of Nature, should not only learn the shape of\nfigures or other objects, and be able to delineate them with truth and\nprecision, but he must also accompany them with their proper lights and\nshadows, according to the situation in which those objects appear.CLXXVI./--_Which of the two is the most useful Knowledge, the\nOutlines of Figures, or that of Light and Shadow._\n\n\n/The/ knowledge of the outline is of most consequence, and yet may be\nacquired to great certainty by dint of study; as the outlines of the\ndifferent parts of the human figure, particularly those which do not\nbend, are invariably the same.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.But the knowledge of the situation,\nquality, and quantity of shadows, being infinite, requires the most\nextensive study.CLXXVII./--_Which is the most important, the Shadows or Outlines\nin Painting._\n\n\n/It/ requires much more observation and study to arrive at perfection\nin the shadowing of a picture, than in merely drawing the lines of it.The proof of this is, that the lines may be traced upon a veil or a\nflat glass placed between the eye and the object to be imitated.But\nthat cannot be of any use in shadowing, on account of the infinite\ngradation of shades, and the blending of them, which does not allow of\nany precise termination; and most frequently they are confused, as will\nbe demonstrated in another place[35].CLXXVIII./--_What is a Painter's first Aim, and Object._\n\n\n/The/ first object of a painter is to make a simple flat surface appear\nlike a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the ground; he\nwho excels all others in that part of the art, deserves the greatest\npraise.This perfection of the art depends on the correct distribution\nof lights and shades, called _Chiaro-scuro_.If the painter then avoids\nshadows, he may be said to avoid the glory of the art, and to render\nhis work despicable to real connoisseurs, for the sake of acquiring the\nesteem of vulgar and ignorant admirers of fine colours, who never have\nany knowledge of relievo.CLXXIX./--_The Difference of Superficies, in regard to Painting._\n\n\n/Solid/ bodies are of two sorts: the one has the surface curvilinear,\noval, or spherical; the other has several surfaces, or sides producing\nangles, either regular or irregular.Spherical, or oval bodies, will\nalways appear detached from their ground, though they are exactly of\nthe same colour.Bodies also of different sides and angles will always\ndetach, because they are always disposed so as to produce shades on\nsome of their sides, which cannot happen to a plain superficies[36].CLXXX./--_How a Painter may become universal._\n\n\n/The/ painter who wishes to be universal, and please a variety of\njudges, must unite in the same composition, objects susceptible of\ngreat force in the shadows, and great sweetness in the management of\nthem; accounting, however, in every instance, for such boldness and\nsoftenings.CLXXXI./--_Accuracy ought to be learnt before Dispatch in the\nExecution._\n\n\n/If/ you wish to make good and useful studies, use great deliberation\nin your drawings, observe well among the lights which, and how many,\nhold the first rank in point of brightness; and so among the shadows,\nwhich are darker than others, and in what manner they blend together;\ncompare the quality and quantity of one with the other, and observe\nto what part they are directed.Be careful also in your outlines, or\ndivisions of the members.Remark well what quantity of parts are to be\non one side, and what on the other; and where they are more or less\napparent, or broad, or slender.Lastly, take care that the shadows and\nlights be united, or lost in each other; without any hard strokes, or\nlines: as smoke loses itself in the air, so are your lights and shadows\nto pass from the one to the other, without any apparent separation.When you have acquired the habit, and formed your hand to accuracy,\nquickness of execution will come of itself[37].CLXXXII./--_How the Painter is to place himself in regard to the\nLight, and his Model._\n\n\n/Let/ A B be the window, M the centre of it, C the model.The best\nsituation for the painter will be a little sideways, between the window\nand his model, as D, so that he may see his object partly in the light\nand partly in the shadow.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CLXXXIII./--_Of the best Light._\n\n\n/The/ light from on high, and not too powerful, will be found the best\ncalculated to shew the parts to advantage.CLXXXIV./--_Of Drawing by Candle-light._\n\n\n/To/ this artificial light apply a paper blind, and you will see the\nshadows undetermined and soft.CLXXXV./--_Of those Painters who draw at Home from one Light,\nand afterwards adapt their Studies to another Situation in the Country,\nand a different Light._\n\n\n/It/ is a great error in some painters who draw a figure from Nature at\nhome, by any particular light, and afterwards make use of that drawing\nin a picture representing an open country, which receives the general\nlight of the sky, where the surrounding air gives light on all sides.This painter would put dark shadows, where Nature would either produce\nnone, or, if any, so very faint as to be almost imperceptible; and he\nwould throw reflected lights where it is impossible there should be any.CLXXXVI./--_How high the Light should be in drawing from Nature._\n\n\n/To/ paint well from Nature, your window should be to the North, that\nthe lights may not vary.If it be to the South, you must have paper\nblinds, that the sun, in going round, may not alter the shadows.The\nsituation of the light should be such as to produce upon the ground a\nshadow from your model as long as that is high.CLXXXVII./--_What Light the Painter must make use of to give\nmost Relief to his Figures._\n\n\n/The/ figures which receive a particular light shew more relief than\nthose which receive an universal one; because the particular light\noccasions some reflexes, which proceed from the light of one object\nupon the shadows of another, and helps to detach it from the dark\nground.But a figure placed in front of a dark and large space, and\nreceiving a particular light, can receive no reflexion from any other\nobjects, and nothing is seen of the figure but what the light strikes\non, the rest being blended and lost in the darkness of the back ground.This is to be applied only to the imitation of night subjects with very\nlittle light.CLXXXVIII./--_Advice to Painters._\n\n\n/Be/ very careful, in painting, to observe, that between the shadows\nthere are other shadows, almost imperceptible, both for darkness and\nshape; and this is proved by the third proposition[38], which says,\nthat the surfaces of globular or convex bodies have as great a variety\nof lights and shadows as the bodies that surround them have.CLXXXIX./--_Of Shadows._\n\n\n/Those/ shadows which in Nature are undetermined, and the extremities of\nwhich can hardly be perceived, are to be copied in your painting in\nthe same manner, never to be precisely finished, but left confused and\nblended.This apparent neglect will shew great judgment, and be the\ningenious result of your observation of Nature.CXC./--_Of the Kind of Light proper for drawing from Relievos,\nor from Nature._\n\n\n/Lights/ separated from the shadows with too much precision, have a\nvery bad effect.In order, therefore, to avoid this inconvenience,\nif the object be in the open country, you need not let your figures\nbe illumined by the sun; but may suppose some transparent clouds\ninterposed, so that the sun not being visible, the termination of the\nshadows will be also imperceptible and soft.CXCI./--_Whether the Light should be admitted in Front or\nsideways; and which is most pleasing and graceful._\n\n\n/The/ light admitted in front of heads situated opposite to side walls\nthat are dark, will cause them to have great relievo, particularly if\nthe light be placed high; and the reason is, that the most prominent\nparts of those faces are illumined by the general light striking them\nin front, which light produces very faint shadows on the part where it\nstrikes; but as it turns towards the sides, it begins to participate\nof the dark shadows of the room, which grow darker in proportion as\nit sinks into them.Besides, when the light comes from on high, it\ndoes not strike on every part of the face alike, but one part produces\ngreat shadows upon another; as the eyebrows, which deprive the whole\nsockets of the eyes of light.The nose keeps it off from great part of\nthe mouth, and the chin from the neck, and such other parts.This, by\nconcentrating the light upon the most projecting parts, produces a very\ngreat relief.CXCII./--_Of the Difference of Lights according to the\nSituation._\n\n\n/A small/ light will cast large and determined shadows upon the\nsurrounding bodies.A large light, on the contrary, will cast small\nshadows on them, and they will be much confused in their termination.When a small but strong light is surrounded by a broad but weaker\nlight, the latter will appear like a demi-tint to the other, as the sky\nround the sun.And the bodies which receive the light from the one,\nwill serve as demi-tints to those which receive the light from the\nother.CXCIII./--_How to distribute the Light on Figures._\n\n\n/The/ lights are to be distributed according to the natural situation\nyou mean your figures should occupy.If you suppose them in sunshine,\nthe shades must be dark, the lights broad and extended, and the shadows\nof all the surrounding objects distinctly marked upon the ground.If\nseen in a gloomy day, there will be very little difference between\nthe lights and shades, and no shadows at the feet.If the figures\nbe represented within doors, the lights and shadows will again be\ndistinctly divided, and produce shadows on the ground.But if you\nsuppose a paper blind at the window, and the walls painted white,\nthe effect will be the same as in a gloomy day, when the lights and\nshadows have little difference.If the figures are enlightened by the\nfire, the lights must be red and powerful, the shadows dark, and the\nshadows upon the ground and upon the walls must be precise; observing\nthat they spread wider as they go off from the body.If the figures\nbe enlightened, partly by the sky and partly by the fire, that side\nwhich receives the light from the sky will be the brightest, and on\nthe other side it will be reddish, somewhat of the colour of the fire.Above all, contrive, that your figures receive a broad light, and that\nfrom above; particularly in portraits, because the people we see in the\nstreet receive all the light from above; and it is curious to observe,\nthat there is not a face ever so well known amongst your acquaintance,\nbut would be recognised with difficulty, if it were enlightened from\nbeneath.CXCIV./--_Of the Beauty of Faces._\n\n\n/You/ must not mark any muscles with hardness of line, but let the\nsoft light glide upon them, and terminate imperceptibly in delightful\nshadows: from this will arise grace and beauty to the face.CXCV./--_How, in drawing a Face, to give it Grace, by the\nManagement of Light and Shade._\n\n\n/A face/ placed in the dark part of a room, acquires great additional\ngrace by means of light and shadow.The shadowed part of the face\nblends with the darkness of the ground, and the light part receives\nan increase of brightness from the open air, the shadows on this side\nbecoming almost insensible; and from this augmentation of light and\nshadow, the face has much relief, and acquires great beauty.CXCVI./--_How to give Grace and Relief to Faces._\n\n\n/In/ streets running towards the west, when the sun is in the meridian,\nand the walls on each side so high that they cast no reflexions on that\nside of the bodies which is in shade, and the sky is not too bright,\nwe find the most advantageous situation for giving relief and grace to\nfigures, particularly to faces; because both sides of the face will\nparticipate of the shadows of the walls.The sides of the nose and\nthe face towards the west, will be light, and the man whom we suppose\nplaced at the entrance, and in the middle of the street, will see all\nthe parts of that face, which are before him, perfectly illumined,\nwhile both sides of it, towards the walls, will be in shadow.What\ngives additional grace is, that these shades do not appear cutting,\nhard, or dry, but softly blended and lost in each other.The reason of\nit is, that the light which is spread all over in the air, strikes also\nthe pavement of the street, and reflecting upon the shady part of the\nface, it tinges that slightly with the same hue: while the great light\nwhich comes from above being confined by the tops of houses, strikes\non the face from different points, almost to the very beginning of\nthe shadows under the projecting parts of the face.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.It diminishes by\ndegrees the strength of them, increasing the light till it comes upon\nthe chin, where it terminates, and loses itself, blending softly into\nthe shades on all sides.For instance, if such light were A E, the line\nF E would give light even to the bottom of the nose.The line C F will\ngive light only to the under lip; but the line A H would extend the\nshadow to all the under parts of the face, and under the chin.In this situation the nose receives a very strong light from all the\npoints A B C D E.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CXCVII./--_Of the Termination of Bodies upon each other._\n\n\n/When/ a body, of a cylindrical or convex surface, terminates upon\nanother body of the same colour, it will appear darker on the edge,\nthan the body upon which it terminates.And any flat body, adjacent to\na white surface, will appear very dark; but upon a dark ground it will\nappear lighter than any other part, though the lights be equal.CXCVIII./--_Of the Back-grounds of painted Objects._\n\n\n/The/ ground which surrounds the figures in any painting, ought to\nbe darker than the light part of those figures, and lighter than the\nshadowed part.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.CXCIX./--_How to detach and bring forward Figures out of their\nBack-ground._\n\n\n/If/ your figure be dark, place it on a light ground; if it be light,\nupon a dark ground; and if it be partly light and partly dark, as is\ngenerally the case, contrive that the dark part of the figure be upon\nthe light part of the ground, and the light side of it against the\ndark[39].CC./--_Of proper Back-grounds._\n\n\n/It/ is of the greatest importance to consider well the nature of\nback-grounds, upon which any opake body is to be placed.In order to\ndetach it properly, you should place the light part of such opake body\nagainst the dark part of the back-ground, and the dark parts on a light\nground[40]; as in the cut[41].[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CCI./--_Of the general Light diffused over Figures._\n\n\n/In/ compositions of many figures and animals, observe, that the parts\nof these different objects ought to be darker in proportion as they are\nlower, and as they are nearer the middle of the groups, though they\nare all of an uniform colour.This is necessary, because a smaller\nportion of the sky (from which all bodies are illuminated) can give\nlight to the lower spaces between these different figures, than to the\nupper parts of the spaces.It is proved thus: A B C D is that portion\nof the sky which gives light to all the objects beneath; M and N are\nthe bodies which occupy the space S T R H, in which it is evidently\nperceived, that the point F, receiving the light only from the portion\nof the sky C D, has a smaller quantity of it than the point E which\nreceives it from the whole space A B (a larger portion than C D);\ntherefore it will be lighter in E than in F.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CCII./--_Of those Parts in Shadows which appear the darkest at a\nDistance._\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n/The/ neck, or any other part which is raised straight upwards, and\nhas a projection over it, will be darker than the perpendicular\nfront of that projection; and this projecting part will be lighter,\nin proportion as it presents a larger surface to the light.For\ninstance, the recess A receives no light from any part of the sky G\nK, but B begins to receive the light from the part of the sky H K,\nand C from G K; and the point D receives the whole of F K. Therefore\nthe chest will be as light as the forehead, nose, and chin.But what\nI have particularly to recommend, in regard to faces, is, that you\nobserve well those different qualities of shades which are lost at\ndifferent distances (while there remain only the first and principal\nspots or strokes of shades, such as those of the sockets of the eyes,\nand other similar recesses, which are always dark), and at last the\nwhole face becomes obscured; because the greatest lights (being small\nin proportion to the demi-tints) are lost.The quality, therefore,\nand quantity of the principal lights and shades are by means of great\ndistance blended together into a general half-tint; and this is the\nreason why trees and other objects are found to be in appearance darker\nat some distance than they are in reality, when nearer to the eye.But then the air, which interposes between the objects and the eye,\nwill render them light again by tinging them with azure, rather in the\nshades than in the lights; for the lights will preserve the truth of\nthe different colours much longer.CCIII./--_Of the Eye viewing the Folds of Draperies surrounding\na Figure._\n\n\n/The/ shadows between the folds of a drapery surrounding the parts of\nthe human body will be darker as the deep hollows where the shadows are\ngenerated are more directly opposite the eye.This is to be observed\nonly when the eye is placed between the light and the shady part of the\nfigure.CCIV./--_Of the Relief of Figures remote from the Eye._\n\n\n/Any/ opake body appears less relieved in proportion as it is farther\ndistant from the eye; because the air, interposed between the eye\nand such body, being lighter than the shadow of it, it tarnishes and\nweakens that shadow, lessens its power, and consequently lessens also\nits relief.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.CCV./--_Of Outlines of Objects on the Side towards the Light._\n\n\n/The/ extremities of any object on the side which receives the light,\nwill appear darker if upon a lighter ground, and lighter if seen upon a\ndarker ground.But if such body be flat, and seen upon a ground equal\nin point of light with itself, and of the same colour, such boundaries,\nor outlines, will be entirely lost to the sight[42].CCVI./--_How to make Objects detach from their Ground, that is\nto say, from the Surface on which they are painted._\n\n\n/Objects/ contrasted with a light ground will appear much more detached\nthan those which are placed against a dark one.The reason is, that\nif you wish to give relief to your figures, you will make those parts\nwhich are the farthest from the light, participate the least of it;\ntherefore they will remain the darkest, and every distinction of\noutline would be lost in the general mass of shadows.But to give it\ngrace, roundness, and effect, those dark shades are always attended by\nreflexes, or else they would either cut too hard upon the ground, or\nstick to it, by the similarity of shade, and relieve the less as the\nground is darker; for at some distance nothing would be seen but the\nlight parts, therefore your figures would appear mutilated of all that\nremains lost in the back-ground.CCVII./--_A Precept._\n\n\n/Figures/ will have more grace, placed in the open and general light,\nthan in any particular or small one; because the powerful and\nextended light will surround and embrace the objects: and works done\nin that kind of light appear pleasant and graceful when placed at a\ndistance[43], while those which are drawn in a narrow light, will\nreceive great force of shadow, but will never appear at a great\ndistance, but as painted objects.CCVIII./--_Of the Interposition of transparent Bodies between\nthe Eye and the Object._\n\n\n/The/ greater the transparent interposition is between the eye and the\nobject, the more the colour of that object will participate of, or be\nchanged into that of the transparent medium[44].When an opake body is situated between the eye and the luminary, so\nthat the central line of the one passes also through the centre of the\nother, that object will be entirely deprived of light.CCIX./--_Of proper Back-grounds for Figures._\n\n\n/As/ we find by experience, that all bodies are surrounded by lights\nand shadows, I would have the painter to accommodate that part which is\nenlightened, so as to terminate upon something dark; and to manage the\ndark parts so that they may terminate on a light ground.This will be\nof great assistance in detaching and bringing out his figures[45].CCX./--_Of Back-grounds._\n\n\n/To/ give a great effect to figures, you must oppose to a light one a\ndark ground, and to a dark figure a light ground, contrasting white\nwith black, and black with white.In general, all contraries give a\nparticular force and brilliancy of effect by their opposition[46].CCXI./--_Of Objects placed on a light Ground, and why such a\nPractice is useful in Painting._\n\n\n/When/ a darkish body terminates upon a light ground, it will appear\ndetached from that ground; because all opake bodies of a curved\nsurface are not only dark on that side which receives no light, and\nconsequently very different from the ground; but even that side of the\ncurved surface which is enlightened, will not carry its principal light\nto the extremities, but have between the ground and the principal light\na certain demi-tint, darker than either the ground or that light.CCXII./--_Of the different Effects of White, according to the\nDifference of Back-grounds._\n\n\n/Any/ thing white will appear whiter, by being opposed to a dark\nground; and, on the contrary, darker upon a light ground.This we learn\nfrom observing snow as it falls; while it is descending it appears\ndarker against the sky, than when we see it against an open window,\nwhich (owing to the darkness of the inside of the house) makes it\nappear very white.Observe also, that snow appears to fall very quick\nand in a great quantity when near the eye; but when at some distance,\nit seems to come down slowly, and in a smaller quantity[47].CCXIII./--_Of Reverberation._\n\n\n/Reverberations/ are produced by all bodies of a bright nature, that\nhave a smooth and tolerably hard surface, which, repelling the light it\nreceives, makes it rebound like a foot-ball against the first object\nopposed to it.CCXIV./--_Where there cannot be any Reverberation of Light._\n\n\n/The/ surfaces of hard bodies are surrounded by various qualities of\nlight and shadow.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.The lights are of two sorts; one is called original,\nthe other derivative.The original light is that which comes from the\nsun, or the brightness of fire, or else from the air.But to return to our definition, I say, there can\nbe no reflexion on that side which is turned towards any dark body;\nsuch as roofs, either high or low, shrubs, grass, wood, either dry\nor green; because, though every individual part of those objects be\nturned towards the original light, and struck by it; yet the quantity\nof shadow which every one of these parts produces upon the others, is\nso great, that, upon the whole, the light, not forming a compact mass,\nloses its effect, so that those objects cannot reflect any light upon\nthe opposite bodies.CCXV./--_In what Part the Reflexes have more or less Brightness._\n\n\n/The/ reflected lights will be more or less apparent or bright, in\nproportion as they are seen against a darker or fainter ground; because\nif the ground be darker than the reflex, then this reflex will appear\nstronger on account of the great difference of colour.But, on the\ncontrary, if this reflexion has behind it a ground lighter than itself,\nit will appear dark, in comparison to the brightness which is close to\nit, and therefore it will be hardly perceptible[48].CCXVI./--_Of the reflected Lights which surround the Shadows._\n\n\n/The/ reflected lights which strike upon the midst of shadows, will\nbrighten up or lessen their obscurity in proportion to the strength\nof those lights, and their proximity to those shadows.Many painters\nneglect this observation, while others attend to and deduce their\npractice from it.This difference of opinion and practice divides the\nsentiments of artists, so that they blame each other for not thinking\nand acting as they themselves do.The best way is to steer a middle\ncourse, and not to admit of any reflected light, but when the cause of\nit is evident to every eye; and _vice versa_, if you introduce none\nat all, let it appear evident that there was no reasonable cause for\nit.In doing so, you will neither be totally blamed nor praised by the\nvariety of opinion, which, if not proceeding from entire ignorance,\nwill ensure to you the approbation of both parties.CCXVII./--_Where Reflexes are to be most apparent._\n\n\n/Of/ all reflected lights, that is to be the most apparent, bold, and\nprecise, which detaches from the darkest ground; and, on the contrary,\nthat which is upon a lighter ground will be less apparent.And this\nproceeds from the contraste of shades, by which the faintest makes the\ndark ones appear still darker; so in contrasted lights, the brightest\ncause the others to appear less bright than they really are[49].CCXVIII./--_What Part of a Reflex is to be the lightest._\n\n\n/That/ part will be the brightest which receives the reflected light\nbetween angles the most nearly equal.For example, let N be the\nluminary, and A B the illuminated part of the object, reflecting the\nlight over all the shady part of the concavity opposite to it.The\nlight which reflects upon F will be placed between equal angles.But\nE at the base will not be reflected by equal angles, as it is evident\nthat the angle E A B is more obtuse than the angle E B A. The angle\nA F B however, though it is between angles of less quality than the\nangle E, and has a common base B A, is between angles more nearly equal\nthan E, therefore it will be lighter in F than in E; and it will also\nbe brighter, because it is nearer to the part which gives them light.According to the 6th rule[50], which says, that part of the body is to\nbe the lightest, which is nearest to the luminary.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CCXIX./--_Of the Termination of Reflexes on their Grounds._\n\n\n/The/ termination of a reflected light on a ground lighter than that\nreflex, will not be perceivable; but if such a reflex terminates upon a\nground darker than itself, it will be plainly seen; and the more so in\nproportion as that ground is darker, and _vice versa_[51].CCXX./--_Of double and treble Reflexions of Light._\n\n\n/Double/ reflexes are stronger than single ones, and the shadows which\ninterpose between the common light and these reflexes are very faint.For instance, let A be the luminous body, A N, A S, are the direct\nrays, and S N the parts which receive the light from them.O and E are\nthe places enlightened by the reflexion of that light in those parts.A N E is a single reflex, but A N O, A S O is the double reflex.The\nsingle reflex is that which proceeds from a single light, but the\ndouble reflexion is produced by two different lights.The single one\nE is produced by the light striking on B D, while the double one O\nproceeds from the enlightened bodies B D and D R co-operating together;\nand the shadows which are between N O and S O will be very faint.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CCXXI./--_Reflexes in the Water, and particularly those of the\nAir._\n\n\n/The/ only portion of air that will be seen reflected in the water,\nwill be that which is reflected by the surface of the water to the eye\nbetween equal angles; that is to say, the angle of incidence must be\nequal to the angle of reflexion.COLOURS /and/ COLOURING.CCXXII./--_What Surface is best calculated to receive most\nColours._\n\n\n/White/ is more capable of receiving all sorts of colours, than the\nsurface of any body whatever, that is not transparent.To prove it, we\nshall say, that any void space is capable of receiving what another\nspace, not void, cannot receive.In the same manner, a white surface,\nlike a void space, being destitute of any colour, will be fittest to\nreceive such as are conveyed to it from any other enlightened body, and\nwill participate more of the colour than black can do; which latter,\nlike a broken vessel, is not able to contain any thing.CCXXIII./--_What Surface will<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "CCXXIV./--_On what Surfaces the true Colour is least apparent._\n\n\n/Polished/ and glossy surfaces shew least of their genuine colour.This\nis exemplified in the grass of the fields, and the leaves of trees,\nwhich, being smooth and glossy, will reflect the colour of the sun, and\nthe air, where they strike, so that the parts which receive the light\ndo not shew their natural colour.CCXXV./--_What Surfaces shew most of their true and genuine\nColour._\n\n\n/Those/ objects that are the least smooth and polished shew their\nnatural colours best; as we see in cloth, and in the leaves of such\ngrass or trees as are of a woolly nature; which, having no lustre,\nare exhibited to the eye in their true natural colour; unless that\ncolour happen to be confused by that of another body casting on them\nreflexions of an opposite colour, such as the redness of the setting\nsun, when all the clouds are tinged with its colour.CCXXVI./--_Of the Mixture of Colours._\n\n\n/Although/ the mixture of colours may be extended to an infinite\nvariety, almost impossible to be described, I will not omit touching\nslightly upon it, setting down at first a certain number of simple\ncolours to serve as a foundation, and with each of these mixing one\nof the others; one with one, then two with two, and three with three,\nproceeding in this manner to the full mixture of all the colors\ntogether: then I would begin again, mixing two of these colours with\ntwo others, and three with three, four with four, and so on to the end.To these two colours we shall put three; to these three add three more,\nand then six, increasing always in the same proportion.I call those simple colours, which are not composed, and cannot be made\nor supplied by any mixture of other colours.Black and White are not\nreckoned among colours; the one is the representative of darkness, the\nother of light: that is, one is a simple privation of light, the other\nis light itself.Yet I will not omit mentioning them, because there is\nnothing in painting more useful and necessary; since painting is but an\neffect produced by lights and shadows, viz.After Black\nand White come Blue and Yellow, then Green, and Tawny or Umber, and\nthen Purple and Red.With these I begin my mixtures, first Black and White, Black and\nYellow, Black and Red; then Yellow and Red: but I shall treat more at\nlength of these mixtures in a separate work[52], which will be of great\nutility, nay very necessary.I shall place this subject between theory\nand practice.CCXXVII./--_Of the Colours produced by the Mixture of other\nColours, called secondary Colours._\n\n\n/The/ first of all simple colours is White, though philosophers will\nnot acknowledge either White or Black to be colours; because the first\nis the cause, or the receiver of colours, the other totally deprived\nof them.But as painters cannot do without either, we shall place them\namong the others; and according to this order of things, White will\nbe the first, Yellow the second, Green the third, Blue the fourth,\nRed the fifth, and Black the sixth.We shall set down White for the\nrepresentative of light, without which no colour can be seen; Yellow\nfor the earth; Green for water; Blue for air; Red for fire; and Black\nfor total darkness.If you wish to see by a short process the variety of all the mixed, or\ncomposed colours, take some  glasses, and, through them, look\nat all the country round: you will find that the colour of each object\nwill be altered and mixed with the colour of the glass through which it\nis seen; observe which colour is made better, and which is hurt by the\nmixture.If the glass be yellow, the colour of the objects may either\nbe improved, or greatly impaired by it.Black and White will be most\naltered, while Green and Yellow will be meliorated.In the same manner\nyou may go through all the mixtures of colours, which are infinite.Select those which are new and agreeable to the sight; and following\nthe same method you may go on with two glasses, or three, till you have\nfound what will best answer your purpose.CCXXVIII./--_Of Verdegris._\n\n\n/This/ green, which is made of copper, though it be mixed with oil,\nwill lose its beauty, if it be not varnished immediately.It not only\nfades, but, if washed with a sponge and pure water only, it will detach\nfrom the ground upon which it is painted, particularly in damp weather;\nbecause verdegris is produced by the strength of salts, which easily\ndissolve in rainy weather, but still more if washed with a wet sponge.CCXXIX./--_How to increase the Beauty of Verdegris._\n\n\n/If/ you mix with the Verdegris some Caballine Aloe, it will add to it\na great degree of beauty.It would acquire still more from Saffron, if\nit did not fade.The quality and goodness of this Aloe will be proved\nby dissolving it in warm Brandy.Supposing the Verdegris has already\nbeen used, and the part finished, you may then glaze it thinly with\nthis dissolved Aloe, and it will produce a very fine colour.This Aloe\nmay be ground also in oil by itself, or with the Verdegris, or any\nother colour, at pleasure.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.CCXXX./--_How to paint a Picture that will last almost for ever._\n\n\n/After/ you have made a drawing of your intended picture, prepare a\ngood and thick priming with pitch and brickdust well pounded; after\nwhich give it a second coat of white lead and Naples yellow; then,\nhaving traced your drawing upon it, and painted your picture, varnish\nit with clear and thick old oil, and stick it to a flat glass, or\ncrystal, with a clear varnish.Another method, which may be better,\nis, instead of the priming of pitch and brickdust, take a flat tile\nwell vitrified, then apply the coat of white and Naples yellow, and all\nthe rest as before.But before the glass is applied to it, the painting\nmust be perfectly dried in a stove, and varnished with nut oil and\namber, or else with purified nut oil alone, thickened in the sun[53].CCXXXI./--_The Mode of painting on Canvass, or Linen Cloth_[54]./Stretch/ your canvass upon a frame, then give it a coat of weak size,\nlet it dry, and draw your outlines upon it.Paint the flesh colours\nfirst; and while it is still fresh or moist, paint also the shadows,\nwell softened and blended together.The flesh colour may be made with\nwhite, lake, and Naples yellow.The shades with black, umber, and\na little lake; you may, if you please, use black chalk.After you\nhave softened this first coat, or dead colour, and let it dry, you\nmay retouch over it with lake and other colours, and gum water that\nhas been a long while made and kept liquid, because in that state it\nbecomes better, and does not leave any gloss.Again, to make the shades\ndarker, take the lake and gum as above, and ink[55]; and with this you\nmay shade or glaze many colours, because it is transparent; such as\nazure, lake, and several others.As for the lights, you may retouch\nor glaze them slightly with gum water and pure lake, particularly\nvermilion.CCXXXII./--_Of lively and beautiful Colours._\n\n\n/For/ those colours which you mean should appear beautiful, prepare a\nground of pure white.This is meant only for transparent colours: as\nfor those that have a body, and are opake, it matters not what ground\nthey have, and a white one is of no use.This is exemplified by painted\nglasses; when placed between the eye and clear air, they exhibit most\nexcellent and beautiful colours, which is not the case, when they have\nthick air, or some opake body behind them.CCXXXIII./--_Of transparent Colours._\n\n\n/When/ a transparent colour is laid upon another of a different\nnature, it produces a mixed colour, different from either of the\nsimple ones which compose it.This is observed in the smoke coming\nout of a chimney, which, when passing before the black soot, appears\nblueish, but as it ascends against the blue of the sky, it changes its\nappearance into a reddish brown.So the colour lake laid on blue will\nturn it to a violet colour; yellow upon blue turns to green; saffron\nupon white becomes yellow; white scumbled upon a dark ground appears\nblue, and is more or less beautiful, as the white and the ground are\nmore or less pure.CCXXXIV./--_In what Part a Colour will appear in its greatest\nBeauty._\n\n\n/We/ are to consider here in what part any colour will shew itself in\nits most perfect purity; whether in the strongest light or deepest\nshadow, in the demi-tint, or in the reflex.It would be necessary to\ndetermine first, of what colour we mean to treat, because different\ncolours differ materially in that respect.Black is most beautiful\nin the shades; white in the strongest light; blue and green in the\nhalf-tint; yellow and red in the principal light; gold in the reflexes;\nand lake in the half-tint.CCXXXV./--_How any Colour without Gloss, is more beautiful in\nthe Lights than in the Shades._\n\n\n/All/ objects which have no gloss, shew their colours better in the\nlight than in the shadow, because the light vivifies and gives a true\nknowledge of the nature of the colour, while the shadows lower, and\ndestroy its beauty, preventing the discovery of its nature.If, on the\ncontrary, black be more beautiful in the shadows, it is because black\nis not a colour.CCXXXVI./--_Of the Appearance of Colours._\n\n\n/The/ lighter a colour is in its nature, the more so it will appear when\nremoved to some distance; but with dark colours it is quite the reverse.CCXXXVII./--_What Part of a Colour is to be the most beautiful._\n\n\n/If/ A be the light, and B the object receiving it in a direct line,\nE cannot receive that light, but only the reflexion from B, which we\nshall suppose to be red.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.In that case, the light it produces being red,\nit will tinge with red the object E; and if E happen to be also red\nbefore, you will see that colour increase in beauty, and appear redder\nthan B; but if E were yellow, you will see a new colour, participating\nof the red and the yellow.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CCXXXVIII./--_That the Beauty of a Colour is to be found\nin the Lights._\n\n\n/As/ the quality of colours is discovered to the eye by the light, it\nis natural to conclude, that where there is most light, there also\nthe true quality of the colour is to be seen; and where there is most\nshadow the colour will participate of, and be tinged with the colour of\nthat shadow.Remember then to shew the true quality of the colour in\nthe light parts only[56].CCXXXIX./--_Of Colours._\n\n\n/The/ colour which is between the light and the shadow will not be so\nbeautiful as that which is in the full light.Therefore the chief beauty\nof colours will be found in the principal lights[57].CCXL./--_No Object appears in its true Colour, unless the\nLight which strikes upon it be of the same Colour._\n\n\n/This/ is very observable in draperies, where the light folds casting a\nreflexion, and throwing a light on other folds opposite to them, make\nthem appear in their natural colour.The same effect is produced by gold\nleaves casting their light reciprocally on each other.The effect is\nquite contrary if the light be received from an object of a different\ncolour[58].CCXLI./--_Of the Colour of Shadows._\n\n\n/The/ colour of the shadows of an object can never be pure if the body\nwhich is opposed to these shadows be not of the same colour as that on\nwhich they are produced.For instance, if in a room, the walls of which\nare green, I place a figure clothed in blue, and receiving the light\nfrom another blue object, the light part of that figure will be of a\nbeautiful blue, but the shadows of it will become dingy, and not like a\ntrue shade of that beautiful blue, because it will be corrupted by the\nreflexions from the green wall; and it would be still worse if the walls\nwere of a darkish brown.CCXLII./--_Of Colours._\n\n\n/Colours/ placed in shadow will preserve more or less of their original\nbeauty, as they are more or less immersed in the shade.But colours\nsituated in a light space will shew their natural beauty in proportion\nto the brightness of that light.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.Some say, that there is as great\nvariety in the colours of shadows, as in the colours of objects shaded\nby them.It may be answered, that colours placed in shadow will shew\nless variety amongst themselves as the shadows are darker.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.We shall\nsoon convince ourselves of this truth, if, from a large square, we look\nthrough the open door of a church, where pictures, though enriched with\na variety of colours, appear all clothed in darkness.CCXLIII./--_Whether it be possible for all Colours to\nappear alike by means of the same Shadow._\n\n\n/It/ is very possible that all the different colours may be changed\ninto that of a general shadow; as is manifest in the darkness of a\ncloudy night, in which neither the shape nor colour of bodies is\ndistinguished.Total darkness being nothing but a privation of the\nprimitive and reflected lights, by which the form and colour of bodies\nare seen; it is evident, that the cause being removed the effect\nceases, and the objects are entirely lost to the sight.CCXLIV./--_Why White is not reckoned among the Colours._\n\n\n/White/ is not a colour, but has the power of receiving all the other\ncolours.When it is placed in a high situation in the country, all its\nshades are azure; according to the fourth proposition[59], which says,\nthat the surface of any opake body participates of the colour of any\nother body sending the light to it.Therefore white being deprived of\nthe light of the sun by the interposition of any other body, will remain\nwhite; if exposed to the sun on one side, and to the open air on the\nother, it will participate both of the colour of the sun and of the air.That side which is not opposed to the sun, will be shaded of the colour\nof the air.And if this white were not surrounded by green fields all\nthe way to the horizon, nor could receive any light from that horizon,\nwithout doubt it would appear of one simple and uniform colour, viz.CCXLV./--_Of Colours._\n\n\n/The/ light of the fire tinges every thing of a reddish yellow; but\nthis will hardly appear evident, if we do not make the comparison with\nthe daylight.Towards the close of the evening this is easily done; but\nmore certainly after the morning twilight; and the difference will be\nclearly distinguished in a dark room, when a little glimpse of daylight\nstrikes upon any part of the room, and there still remains a candle\nburning.Without such a trial the difference is hardly perceivable,\nparticularly in those colours which have most similarity; such as white\nand yellow, light green and light blue; because the light which strikes\nthe blue, being yellow, will naturally turn it green; as we have said\nin another place[60], that a mixture of blue and yellow produces green.And if to a green colour you add some yellow, it will make it of a more\nbeautiful green.CCXLVI./--_Of the Colouring of remote Objects._\n\n\n/The/ painter, who is to represent objects at some distance from the\neye, ought merely to convey the idea of general undetermined masses,\nmaking choice, for that purpose, of cloudy weather, or towards the\nevening, and avoiding, as was said before, to mark the lights and\nshadows too strong on the extremities; because they would in that\ncase appear like spots of difficult execution, and without grace.He\nought to remember, that the shadows are never to be of such a quality,\nas to obliterate the proper colour, in which they originated; if the\nsituation of the <DW52> body be not in total darkness.He ought to\nmark no outline, not to make the hair stringy, and not to touch with\npure white, any but those things which in themselves are white; in\nshort, the lightest touch upon any particular object ought to denote\nthe beauty of its proper and natural colour.CCXLVII./--_The Surface of all opake Bodies participates\nof the Colour of the surrounding Objects._\n\n\n/The/ painter ought to know, that if any white object is placed between\ntwo walls, one of which is also white, and the other black, there will\nbe found between the shady side of that object and the light side, a\nsimilar proportion to that of the two walls; and if that object be\nblue, the effect will be the same.Having therefore to paint this\nobject, take some black, similar to that of the wall from which the\nreflexes come; and to proceed by a certain and scientific method, do as\nfollows.When you paint the wall, take a small spoon to measure exactly\nthe quantity of colour you mean to employ in mixing your tints; for\ninstance, if you have put in the shading of this wall three spoonfuls\nof pure black, and one of white, you have, without any doubt, a mixture\nof a certain and precise quality.Now having painted one of the walls\nwhite, and the other dark, if you mean to place a blue object between\nthem with shades suitable to that colour, place first on your pallet\nthe light blue, such as you mean it to be, without any mixture of\nshade, and it will do for the lightest part of your object.After which\ntake three spoonfuls of black, and one of this light blue, for your\ndarkest shades.Then observe whether your object be round or square:\nif it be square, these two extreme tints of light and shade will be\nclose to each other, cutting sharply at the angle; but if it be round,\ndraw lines from the extremities of the walls to the centre of the\nobject, and put the darkest shade between equal angles, where the lines\nintersect upon the superficies of it; then begin to make them lighter\nand lighter gradually to the point N O, lessening the strength of the\nshadows as much as that place participates of the light A D, and mixing\nthat colour with the darkest shade A B, in the same proportion.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CCXLVIII./--_General Remarks on Colours._\n\n\n/Blue/ and green are not simple colours in their nature, for blue is\ncomposed of light and darkness; such is the azure of the sky, viz.Green is composed of a simple and a\nmixed colour, being produced by blue and yellow.Any object seen in a mirror, will participate of the colour of that\nbody which serves as a mirror; and the mirror in its turn is tinged in\npart by the colour of the object it represents; they partake more or\nless of each other as the colour of the object seen is more or less\nstrong than the colour of the mirror.That object will appear of the\nstrongest and most lively colour in the mirror, which has the most\naffinity to the colour of the mirror itself.Of  bodies, the purest white will be seen at the greatest\ndistance, therefore the darker the colour, the less it will bear\ndistance.Of different bodies equal in whiteness, and in distance from the eye,\nthat which is surrounded by the greatest darkness will appear the\nwhitest; and on the contrary, that shadow will appear the darkest that\nhas the brightest white round it.Of different colours, equally perfect, that will appear most excellent,\nwhich is seen near its direct contrary.A pale colour against red, a\nblack upon white (though neither the one nor the other are colours),\nblue near a yellow; green near red; because each colour is more\ndistinctly seen, when opposed to its contrary, than to any other\nsimilar to it.Any thing white seen in a dense air full of vapours, will appear larger\nthan it is in reality.The air, between the eye and the object seen, will change the colour\nof that object into its own; so will the azure of the air change the\ndistant mountains into blue masses.Through a red glass every thing\nappears red; the light round the stars is dimmed by the darkness of the\nair, which fills the space between the eye and the planets.The true colour of any object whatever will be seen in those parts\nwhich are not occupied by any kind of shade, and have not any gloss (if\nit be a polished surface).I say, that white terminating abruptly upon a dark ground, will cause\nthat part where it terminates to appear darker, and the white whiter.COLOURS IN REGARD TO LIGHT AND SHADOW.CCXLIX./--_Of the Light proper for painting Flesh Colour from\nNature._\n\n\n/Your/ window must be open to the sky, and the walls painted of a\nreddish colour.The summertime is the best, when the clouds conceal the\nsun, or else your walls on the south side of the room must be so high,\nas that the sun-beams cannot strike on the opposite side, in order\nthat the reflexion of those beams may not destroy the shadows.CCL./--_Of the Painter's Window._\n\n\n/The/ window which gives light to a painting-room, ought to be made of\noiled paper, without any cross bar, or projecting edge at the opening,\nor any sharp angle in the inside of the wall, but should be slanting by\ndegrees the whole thickness of it; and the sides be painted black.CCLI./--_The Shadows of Colours._\n\n\n/The/ shadows of any colour whatever must participate of that colour\nmore or less, as it is nearer to, or more remote from the mass of\nshadows; and also in proportion to its distance from, or proximity to\nthe mass of light.CCLII./--_Of the Shadows of White._\n\n\n/To/ any white body receiving the light from the sun, or the air, the\nshadows should be of a blueish cast; because white is no colour, but a\nreceiver of all colours; and as by the fourth proposition[61] we learn,\nthat the surface of any object participates of the colours of other\nobjects near it, it is evident that a white surface will participate of\nthe colour of the air by which it is surrounded.CCLIII./--_Which of the Colours will produce the darkest Shade._\n\n\n/That/ shade will be the darkest which is produced by the whitest\nsurface; this also will have a greater propensity to variety than any\nother surface; because white is not properly a colour, but a receiver\nof colours, and its surface will participate strongly of the colour of\nsurrounding objects, but principally of black or any other dark colour,\nwhich being the most opposite to its nature, produces the most sensible\ndifference between the shadows and the lights.CCLIV./--_How to manage, when a White terminates upon another\nWhite._\n\n\n/When/ one white body terminates on another of the same colour, the\nwhite of these two bodies will be either alike or not.If they be\nalike, that object which of the two is nearest to the eye, should be\nmade a little darker than the other, upon the rounding of the outline;\nbut if the object which serves as a ground to the other be not quite so\nwhite, the latter will detach of itself, without the help of any darker\ntermination.CCLV./--_On the Back-grounds of Figures._\n\n\n/Of/ two objects equally light, one will appear less so if seen upon\na whiter ground; and, on the contrary, it will appear a great deal\nlighter if upon a space of a darker shade.So flesh colour will appear\npale upon a red ground, and a pale colour will appear redder upon\na yellow ground.In short, colours will appear what they are not,\naccording to the ground which surrounds them.CCLVI./--_The Mode of composing History._\n\n\n/Amongst/ the figures which compose an historical picture, those which\nare meant to appear the nearest to the eye, must have the greatest\nforce; according to the second proposition[62] of the third book, which\nsays, that colour will be seen in the greatest perfection which has\nless air interposed between it and the eye of the beholder; and for\nthat reason the shadows (by which we express the relievo of bodies)\nappear darker when near than when at a distance, being then deadened by\nthe air which interposes.This does not happen to those shadows which\nare near the eye, where they will produce the greatest relievo when\nthey are darkest.CCLVII./--_Remarks concerning Lights and Shadows._\n\n\n/Observe/, that where the shadows end, there be always a kind of\nhalf-shadow to blend them with the lights.The shadow derived from any\nobject will mix more with the light at its termination, in proportion\nas it is more distant from that object.But the colour of the shadow\nwill never be simple: this is proved by the ninth proposition[63],\nwhich says, that the superficies of any object participates of the\ncolours of other bodies, by which it is surrounded, although it were\ntransparent, such as water, air, and the like: because the air receives\nits light from the sun, and darkness is produced by the privation of\nit.But as the air has no colour in itself any more than water, it\nreceives all the colours that are between the object and the eye.The\nvapours mixing with the air in the lower regions near the earth, render\nit thick, and apt to reflect the sun's rays on all sides, while the air\nabove remains dark; and because light (that is, white) and darkness\n(that is, black), mixed together, compose the azure that becomes the\ncolour of the sky, which is lighter or darker in proportion as the air\nis more or less mixed with damp vapours.CCLVIII./--_Why the Shadows of Bodies upon a white Wall are\nblueish towards Evening._\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n/The/ shadows of bodies produced by the redness of the setting\nsun, will always be blueish.This is accounted for by the eleventh\nproposition[64], which says, that the superficies of any opake body\nparticipates of the colour of the object from which it receives the\nlight; therefore the white wall being deprived entirely of colour, is\ntinged by the colour of those bodies from which it receives the light,\nwhich in this case are the sun and the sky.But because the sun is red\ntowards the evening, and the sky is blue, the shadow on the wall not\nbeing enlightened by the sun, receives only the reflexion of the sky,\nand therefore will appear blue; and the rest of the wall, receiving\nlight immediately from the sun, will participate of its red colour.CCLIX./--_Of the Colour of Faces._\n\n\n/The/ colour of any object will appear more or less distinct in\nproportion to the extent of its surface.This proportion is proved, by\nobserving that a face appears dark at a small distance, because, being\ncomposed of many small parts, it produces a great number of shadows;\nand the lights being the smallest part of it, are soonest lost to the\nsight, leaving only the shadows, which being in a greater quantity, the\nwhole of the face appears dark, and the more so if that face has on the\nhead, or at the back, something whiter.CCLX./--_A Precept relating to Painting._\n\n\n/Where/ the shadows terminate upon the lights, observe well what parts\nof them are lighter than the others, and where they are more or less\nsoftened and blended; but above all remember, that young people have\nno sharp shadings: their flesh is transparent, something like what\nwe observe when we put our hand between the sun and eyes; it appears\nreddish, and of a transparent brightness.If you wish to know what\nkind of shadow will suit the flesh colour you are painting, place one\nof your fingers close to your picture, so as to cast a shadow upon it,\nand according as you wish it either lighter or darker, put it nearer or\nfarther from it, and imitate it.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.CCLXI./--_Of Colours in Shadow._\n\n\n/It/ happens very often that the shadows of an opake body do not retain\nthe same colour as the lights.Sometimes they will be greenish, while\nthe lights are reddish, although this opake body be all over of one\nuniform colour.This happens when the light falls upon the object (we\nwill suppose from the East), and tinges that side with its own colour.In the West we will suppose another opake body of a colour different\nfrom the first, but receiving the same light.This last will reflect\nits colour towards the East, and strike the first with its rays on the\nopposite side, where they will be stopped, and remain with their full\ncolour and brightness.We often see a white object with red lights, and\nthe shades of a blueish cast; this we observe particularly in mountains\ncovered with snow, at sun-set, when the effulgence of its rays makes\nthe horizon appear all on fire.CCLXII./--_Of the Choice of Lights._\n\n\n/Whatever/ object you intend to represent is to be supposed situated\nin a particular light, and that entirely of your own choosing.If you\nimagine such objects to be in the country, and the sun be overcast,\nthey will be surrounded by a great quantity of general light.If the\nsun strikes upon those objects, then the shadows will be very dark,\nin proportion to the lights, and will be determined and sharp; the\nprimitive as well as the secondary ones.These shadows will vary from\nthe lights in colour, because on that side the object receives a\nreflected light hue from the azure of the air, which tinges that part;\nand this is particularly observable in white objects.That side which\nreceives the light from the sun, participates also of the colour of\nthat.This may be particularly observed in the evening, when the sun\nis setting between the clouds, which it reddens; those clouds being\ntinged with the colour of the body illuminating them, the red colour\nof the clouds, with that of the sun, casts a hue on those parts which\nreceive the light from them.On the contrary, those parts which are not\nturned towards that side of the sky, remain of the colour of the air,\nso that the former and the latter are of two different colours.This\nwe must not lose sight of, that, knowing the cause of those lights and\nshades, it be made apparent in the effect, or else the work will be\nfalse and absurd.But if a figure be situated within a house, and seen\nfrom without, such figure will have its shadows very soft; and if the\nbeholder stands in the line of the light, it will acquire grace, and do\ncredit to the painter, as it will have great relief in the lights, and\nsoft and well-blended shadows, particularly in those parts where the\ninside of the room appears less obscure, because there the shadows are\nalmost imperceptible: the cause of which we shall explain in its proper\nplace.COLOURS IN REGARD TO BACK-GROUNDS.CCLXIII./--_Of avoiding hard Outlines._\n\n\n/Do/ not make the boundaries of your figures with any other colour\nthan that of the back-ground, on which they are placed; that is, avoid\nmaking dark outlines.CCLXIV./--_Of Outlines._\n\n\n/The/ extremities of objects which are at some distance, are not seen\nso distinctly as if they were nearer.Therefore the painter ought to\nregulate the strength of his outlines, or extremities, according to the\ndistance.The boundaries which separate one body from another, are of the nature\nof mathematical lines, but not of real lines.The end of any colour\nis only the beginning of another, and it ought not to be called a\nline, for nothing interposes between them, except the termination of\nthe one against the other, which being nothing in itself, cannot be\nperceivable; therefore the painter ought not to pronounce it in distant\nobjects.CCLXV./--_Of Back-grounds._\n\n\n/One/ of the principal parts of painting is the nature and quality of\nback-grounds, upon which the extremities of any convex or solid body\nwill always detach and be distinguished in nature, though the colour\nof such objects, and that of the ground, be exactly the same.This\nhappens, because the convex sides of solid bodies do not receive the\nlight in the same manner with the ground, for such sides or extremities\nare often lighter or darker than the ground.But if such extremities\nwere to be of the same colour as the ground, and in the same degree\nof light, they certainly could not be distinguished.Therefore such a\nchoice in painting ought to be avoided by all intelligent and judicious\npainters; since the intention is to make the objects appear as it were\nout of the ground.The above case would produce the contrary effect,\nnot only in painting, but also in objects of real relievo.CCLXVI./--_How to detach Figures from the Ground._\n\n\n/All/ solid bodies will appear to have a greater relief, and to come\nmore out of the canvass, on a ground of an undetermined colour, with\nthe greatest variety of lights and shades against the confines of\nsuch bodies (as will be demonstrated in its place), provided a proper\ndiminution of lights in the white tints, and of darkness in the shades,\nbe judiciously observed.CCLXVII./--_Of Uniformity and Variety of Colours upon plain\nSurfaces._\n\n\n/The/ back-grounds of any flat surfaces which are uniform in colour and\nquantity of light, will never appear separated from each other; _vice\nversa_, they will appear separated if they are of different colours or\nlights.CCLXVIII./--_Of Back-grounds suitable both to Shadows and\nLights._\n\n\n/The/ shadows or lights which surround figures, or any other objects,\nwill help the more to detach them the more they", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "CCLXIX./--_The apparent Variation of Colours, occasioned by the\nContraste of the Ground upon which they are placed._\n\n\n/No/ colour appears uniform and equal in all its parts unless it\nterminate on a ground of the same colour.This is very apparent when a\nblack terminates on a white ground, where the contraste of colour gives\nmore strength and richness to the extremities than to the middle.CONTRASTE, HARMONY, AND REFLEXES, IN REGARD TO COLOURS.CCLXX./--_Gradation in Painting._\n\n\n/What/ is fine is not always beautiful and good: I address this to\nsuch painters as are so attached to the beauty of colours, that they\nregret being obliged to give them almost imperceptible shadows, not\nconsidering the beautiful relief which figures acquire by a proper\ngradation and strength of shadows.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Such persons may be compared to\nthose speakers who in conversation make use of many fine words without\nmeaning, which altogether scarcely form one good sentence.CCLXXI./--_How to assort Colours in such a Manner as that they\nmay add Beauty to each other._\n\n\n/If/ you mean that the proximity of one colour should give beauty to\nanother that terminates near it, observe the rays of the sun in the\ncomposition of the rainbow, the colours of which are generated by the\nfalling rain, when each drop in its descent takes every colour of that\nbow, as is demonstrated in its place[65].If you mean to represent great darkness, it must be done by contrasting\nit with great light; on the contrary, if you want to produce great\nbrightness, you must oppose to it a very dark shade: so a pale yellow\nwill cause red to appear more beautiful than if opposed to a purple\ncolour.There is another rule, by observing which, though you do not increase\nthe natural beauty of the colours, yet by bringing them together they\nmay give additional grace to each other, as green placed near red,\nwhile the effect would be quite the reverse, if placed near blue.Harmony and grace are also produced by a judicious arrangement of\ncolours, such as blue with pale yellow or white, and the like; as will\nbe noticed in its place.CCLXXII./--_Of detaching the Figures._\n\n\n/Let/ the colours of which the draperies of your figures are composed,\nbe such as to form a pleasing variety, to distinguish one from the\nother; and although, for the sake of harmony, they should be of the\nsame nature[66], they must not stick together, but vary in point of\nlight, according to the distance and interposition of the air between\nthem.By the same rule, the outlines are to be more precise, or lost,\nin proportion to their distance or proximity.CCLXXIII./--_Of the Colour of Reflexes._\n\n\n/All/ reflected colours are less brilliant and strong, than those which\nreceive a direct light, in the same proportion as there is between the\nlight of a body and the cause of that light.CCLXXIV./--_What Body will be the most strongly tinged with the\nColour of any other Object._\n\n\n/An/ opake surface will partake most of the genuine colour of the body\nnearest to it, because a great quantity of the species of colour will\nbe conveyed to it;

he was, however, far from being\nfierce.At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the\nblessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who\nhad been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully\nenlightened and convinced by her intercession.He importuned me to come\nand visit him often.Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of\nNorthamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and\nsurveyor, now building the Cathedral of St.Paul, and the column in\nmemory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of\nfifty parish churches.Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose\na match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.I excused myself all I was able; for the\ntruth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a\nyouth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render\nhim a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me\napprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like\na friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to\nreceive a large share of her father's opulence.Lord Sunderland was much\nsunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no\nlonger Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King\nfor siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am\nassured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the\npreservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of\nthe party to carry it.However, so earnest and importunate was the\nCountess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too\ngreat an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,\nand he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual\nliking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the\nhonor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he\nwould do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable\nof expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of\nage, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as\ncivilly as I could.Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet\nsomewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in\ntime will wear off.There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John\nElowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related\nto my wife, and other company.There had scarce fallen any rain since\nChristmas.I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen\npresented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,\nintroduced by the Duke of Albemarle.Being at the Privy Council, I took\nanother occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter\nand to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in\ncase the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first\ndesiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could\ntransmit it to him privately, he would make her portion L14,000, though\nto all appearance he might likely make it L50,000 as easily, his eldest\nson having no child and growing very corpulent.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.It still continued so great a drought as had never been\nknown in England, and it was said to be universal.No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not\nhappen twice in this parish these thirty years;

as venison,\nrabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all\nsorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts\nof fresh fish.After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I\nnever saw so many herons.The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and\nexceedingly improved since Mr.Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,\nwho spent a fair estate.The house is timber, but commodious, and with\none ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and\nhuntings, etc., the work of Mr.Barlow, who is excellent in this kind\nfrom the life.Hussey (at Sutton in\nShere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's.He\nis the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field\naccommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,\nas to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,\nstables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him;

and so, on the 2d of September,\nI once more returned to my home.Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the\n8th [at Deptford].Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the\npurchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since\ngiven to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a\nhospital;

showing me a letter of Mr.Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his\nLordship.He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate\nlady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,\nand Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of\nthe Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular\nof the jointure which Mr.Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,\nyet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent\nmatch for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the\ngreatest prince in Christendom;

a wise and\nlearned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister\nof state than to have been laid aside.I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador\nbefore both their Majesties in the Banqueting House.The presents were\ncarried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the\nKing's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was\ndoubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador\nhaving passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large\nPersian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so\nsplendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's\nrestoration.This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his\ncoach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no\nKing's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of\nit under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the\nCeremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he\nomitted the least punctilio.It was reported he condemned his son to\nlose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the\nFrench mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the\nFrench King interceded--but qy.Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal\nSociety], Mr.Plot, the ingenious author of\nthe \"History of Oxfordshire.\"11th January, 1681-82.I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,\nhis retinue not numerous.He was received in the Banqueting House, both\ntheir Majesties being present.He came up to the throne without making\nany sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body.He spoke by a\nrenegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise.They\nwere all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of  cloth, or silk,\nwith buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,\nso large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,\nnaked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich\nscymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts.The Ambassador had a string\nof pearls oddly woven in his turban.I fancy the old Roman habit was\nlittle different as to the mantle and naked limbs.He was a handsome\nperson, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at\nTangier.But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so\nas the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were\nastonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and\nperformed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of\ntheir country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it\nbeing his marriage day, after twenty-four years.He related to me how he\nhad been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a\ndelegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy\nupon her marriage with Mr.Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of\nDanby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere\nadvice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and\npartialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being\nPaymaster of the Army.The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's\ncredit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could\nprocure none but by his means, \"for that reason,\" replied the Bishop, \"I\nwould have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest\nand of credit.\"He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty\nof access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him\nhated.To the Royal Society, where at the Council we\npassed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as\nwhether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary\nmembers, that none should be admitted but by diploma.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\nThis evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the\nDuchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a\ngreat banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador\nand his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and\nmodesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and\namong these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and\nSussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle\nof that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make\nthem; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,\nfurniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of\nthe banquet.They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;\nthey also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or\nstare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly\nnegligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to\nsuch questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and\nso gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the\nDuchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of\nRichmond.The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was\ngoing away.In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)\nentertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park\non horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary\nactivity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full\nspeed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,\nmanaging their spears with incredible agility.He went sometimes to the\ntheaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not\nforbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary\nmodesty and gravity.In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court\nbehaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.[Footnote 45: Sherbet and chocolate.]This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again\nwith his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal\nHospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal\nSociety had sold to his Majesty for L1,300, and that he would settle\nL5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of L20,000 for the relief\nand reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,\nor monastery.I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only\nthe whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a\ngrand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate\nby the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,\nas to the government.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.So, in his study we arranged the governor,\nchaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,\nporter, and other officers, with their several salaries and\nentertainments.I would needs have a library, and mentioned several\nbooks, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at\nleisure to recollect.Thus we made the first calculations, and set down\nour thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty\nand the Archbishop.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.He also engaged me to consider of what laws and\norders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as\nstrict as in any religious convent.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr.Abel, newly returned from\nItaly; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had\nbeen a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,\nbeing accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed\nme a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building\nroyal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate\na piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,\nmanning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so\nastonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in\nperspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can\nshow the like.My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor\nBartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing\nmy legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and\nsitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and\ndrinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only\nmissed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I\ncould not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I\nthink, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and\nmethodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the\ngoods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best\norder I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might\nhave none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it\nshould please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.With\nthis, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of\nsickness.The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in\nthat day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!My second grandchild was born, and christened the next\nday by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.[46] I beseech God\nto bless him![Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in\n    1713.]I went to church: our vicar preached on\nProverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping\nof the heart upright.The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God\nthanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and\naffording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the\ncongregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious\nresolutions.Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr.Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr.This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his\naccomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr.Thynn, set on by the\nprincipal Koningsmark.He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as\none that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count\nKoningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and\nwas acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away.Vrats told a friend of\nmine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that\nhe did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal\nwith him like a gentleman.Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad\nfate.I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,\nColonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported\nto his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first\nembalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a\ncoffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to\nappearance using any bituminous matter.The flesh was florid, soft, and\nfull, as if the person were only sleeping.He had now been dead near\nfifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too\nmagnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\nAt the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber\nsent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in\nanother a gnat, both very entire.There was a discourse of the tingeing\nof glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red\ncolor effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the\nmost diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance\nof what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless\nincorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all\nbeyond the superfices.To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated\nwhat collections should be published monthly, as formerly the\ntransactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much\ncalled for by the curious abroad and at home.I went this afternoon with several of the Royal\nSociety to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in\nMonsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,\nand mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,\nand with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible\nquantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of\nbeef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious\nthat I had ever seen, or tasted.We ate pike and other fish, bones and\nall, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted\njust as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,\nwithout any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in\nbalneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser\nsubstances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best\ndescanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and\nstewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr.Papin's book, published and\ndedicated to our Society of which he is a member.He is since gone to\nVenice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),\nwho carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set\nup a philosophical meeting in that city.This philosophical supper\ncaused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company.I\nsent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the\nladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]\n\n    [Footnote 47: Denys Papin, a French physician and mathematician, who\n    possessed so remarkable a knowledge of mathematics, that he very\n    nearly brought the invention of the steam engine into working order.Boyle in his pneumatic experiments, and was\n    afterward mathematical professor at Marburg.The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox and Sir Christopher\nWren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the\ncollege to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation.It\nwas a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger\nquadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the accommodation of 440\npersons, with governor and officers.The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come to London, after his\nescape and shipwreck, as he went by sea for Scotland.At the Rolls' chapel preached the famous Dr.10, describing excellently well what was meant by election;\nviz, not the effect of any irreversible decree, but so called because\nthey embraced the Gospel readily, by which they became elect, or\nprecious to God.It would be very needless to make our calling and\nelection sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians\npretend.Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful\npile.I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester of what\nMaimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's\nperversion, in his \"History of Calvinism;\" and did myself write to the\nBishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to\nset forth his vindication.The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member\nof the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I\nwas deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we\nhad in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being\ninvited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the\nentertainment to contemplate the exotic guests.They were both very\nhard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close\nwaistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps\nmade like fruit baskets.They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the\nhafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly\nkeen, and of Damascus metal.The second Ambassador\n(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so\ntedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a\nlittle part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other\ndifference of habit, and was half a <DW64>, bare legged and naked feet,\nand deemed a very holy man.They sat cross-legged like Turks, and\nsometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as\nblack as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of\nperpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much\nraging in their country, is", "question": "Where is John?

the inhabitants are\nstill pagans and idolaters.They seemed of a dull and heavy\nconstitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly\nastonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking\nwe were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects\ncould possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being\nall slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our\nhappiness.They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat\nslaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth\nand loathsome.They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without\nspoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very\ndexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young\nEarl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.Bohun, whose whole\nhouse is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are\ncontrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an\nexcellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule.The landscapes of the screens\nrepresent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.But, above\nall, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and\nchimney-piece, with Mr.There are also some of\nStreeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver\nas growing in the mines.The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole\nplace very agreeable and well watered.Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor\npeople, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the\nadditions which Mr.Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in\nminiature, and collection of insects.With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the\nRoyal Hospital begun at Chelsea.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n9th August, 1682.The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended\nto them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy\nwhich Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription\nof worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to\nlessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into\nFrance to be taught military exercises.We thought to give him all the\nencouragement our recommendation could procure.Rogers, an acquaintance of mine\nlong since at Padua.He was then Consul of the English nation, and\nstudent in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;\npresenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous\nDr.Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very\nbright, but the stream not so long as the former.Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his\nbrother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house\nthe Tuesday following.Being my birthday, and I now entering my great\nclimacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,\ngiving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and\nforbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his\nblessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her\nbuilding, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick;

but women will have their\nwill.I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the\nSwedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the\nbirthday of his King.There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of\nHamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,\nthe son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great\npersons.I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),\nbut the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,\nexcess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the\ncompany as soon as we rose from table.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n28th November, 1682.I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the\nauditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting\nfit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I\nrecovered it after a short repose.I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to\nstand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my\nfriends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,\nI desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one\nof the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,\nwho accordingly was elected.[Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)\nnewly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to\nthe Earl of Ossory.I sold my East India adventure of L250 principal\nfor L750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company\ntwenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing\nof God.23d January, 1682-83.Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord\nChief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of\nNottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him.He is a\nmost knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an\nexcellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful\nin music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a\nselect company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr.Gale (that learned\nschoolmaster of St.The\nconversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable\nquestions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman\nEmperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which\nsignifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_.James's, when I saw the sea\ncharts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to\nshow the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the\nThames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,\nrock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to\nproceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by\nchains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking.He\naffirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so\ntrue as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen\nElizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.This morning I received the news of the death of my\nfather-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt.and Bart., who died at my house\nat Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored\nunder the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his\nage.The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much\ndecency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;\nthere being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,\nand all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been\nMaster, and others of the country.The vicar preached a short but proper\ndiscourse on Psalm xxxix.10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,\nconcluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,\nrelating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in\nGreek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal\nloyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the\nChurch of England in its public worship during its persecution by the\nlate rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers\nBishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in\nhis house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the <DW7>s\n(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its\nvisibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'\nexile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year\n1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect\nhimself, his great age, infirmities, and death.He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are\nbuilt those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen.He was\nborn the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the\nlast [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir.His\ngrandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the\ngreat Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government\nof the Netherland.He was Master of the Household to King James, and\nCofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through\nEngland for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,\nwhich was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that\nhe had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;\nhe died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the\ncompositions in a Parliament of King James.By his mother's side he was\na Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen\nMary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,\nrelated to divers of the English nobility.Thus ended this honorable\nperson, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house\nwhere he was born.\"Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may\napply our hearts unto wisdom!\"[Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the\n    \"Diary.\"The different counties were bound to supply provisions of\n    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called\n    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of\n    Parliament.]By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be\nburied in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,\nadjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of\nEssex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of\nburying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a\nfavor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of\nmaking churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and\nprejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual\ndisturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may\nbe read in his testament.I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in\nplanting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles\nin circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these\nsuddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves.He from a\nmerchant's apprentice, and management of the East India Company's stock,\nbeing arrived to an estate (it is said) of L200,000; and lately married\nhis daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of\nWorcester, with L50,000 portional present, and various expectations.Houblon's, a rich and gentle French merchant, who was\nbuilding a house in the Forest, near Sir J.

Dr.W. the most facetious\nman in nature, and now Censor of the college.I was here consulted where\nthey should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so\nnear Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most\nof our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of\nsome few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his\npower after the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n21st March, 1683.Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor.12; I\nesteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of\nEngland, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and\ningenious.The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear\nhim out, which would be an inexpressible loss.Charleton's lecture on the heart in\nthe Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.To London, in order to my passing the following week,\nfor the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the\nHoly Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other\nplaces.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n6th April, 1683.There was in the afternoon, according to\ncustom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall;

he told me if he\nmight sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely\n(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best.The person who desired\nme to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,\ncontemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of\nPendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity\nHouse; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the\ngrooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and\nunderstanding gentleman in sea affairs.To our Society, where we received the Count de\nZinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we\nshowed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the\nSociety were upon.I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at\nSir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal\npretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for\nthe painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising\nto me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St.George's Hall,\nrepresenting the legend of St.George, and triumph of the Black Prince,\nand his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally\nfinished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the\nAscension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most\nfamous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar.I liked the\ncontrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the\nstupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our\nGibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for\ninvention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor\ndoubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique\nand heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the\nonly doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist\nclimate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the\ngrass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new\npark, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,\nand receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing\nso huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the\ncastle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of\nSir Samuel Morland.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of\nBath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of\nLondon, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendome (a\nyoung wild spark), and Mr.After evening prayer, I\nwalked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse\nof the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc.Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr.Turner, one of the Duke's\nchaplains was made dean.I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who\nbeing hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was\ngoing into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the\nalarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to\nus.By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection\nthat courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their\npleasure.It put me in mind of Horace's \"Mouse,\" and to bless God for my\nown private condition.Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately\nfled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition\nof the Protestants there.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n18th June, 1683.I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission\nand petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the\ncity of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they\ndelivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber.It was delivered\nkneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,\nthe mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a\nspeech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the\nlate election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common\nhall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the\ngovernment, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high\ndispleasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles\nas the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter\njudgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended.The things\nrequired were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,\nsheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor\nsteward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if\nthey presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in\nwonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty\nto nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to\nthis, all former miscarriages should be forgotten.And so they tamely\nparted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been\ntreated by the King.What\nthe consequences will prove, time will show.Divers of the old and most\nlearned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit\ntheir charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;\nbut the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it\notherwise.The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now\nsensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and\ngiddiness of Oates, so as the <DW7>s began to hold up their heads\nhigher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything\nsteady or prudent, for these last seven years.I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of\nClarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but\na few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to\ncertain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach\nhad gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;\nwhich must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp\nwas fallen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as\nthey called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and\nothers should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they\nwere to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and\nespecially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of\nthe Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr.Algernon Sidney, son to the\nold Earl of Leicester, Mr.Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,\nand others.A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of\nMonmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond\nsea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only\nseizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of\nthe danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again\nadmitted to the councils and cabinet secrets.The Lords Essex and\nRussell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention\nagainst the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn\nin by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management\nrelating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,\netc.They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false\nbrethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken\neffect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to\nunknown and dangerous events; which God avert!Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of\nMartha Maria, our Vicar officiating.I pray God bless her, and may she\nchoose the better part![Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n13th July, 1683.As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,\nin Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of\nEssex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in\nthe Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord\nRussell was on his trial, and had sentence of death.This accident\nexceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a\nperson of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and\nso much obliged to the King.It is certain the King and Duke were at the\nTower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when\nmy Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated\nthe horrid act.Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he\nshould do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and\nwide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the\njugulars, it reached to the very vertebrae of the neck, so that the head\nheld to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the\nrazor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that\nhaving passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,\nthat an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax.The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord\nRussell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury\nand all the Bench to his prejudice.Others said that he had himself on\nsome occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his\nlife taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his\nestate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of\nthat Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with\nthemselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent\nconversation that I have no inclination to credit them.What might\ninstigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture.My Lord\nClarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,\nassured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect\nof his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no\nsevere intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to\nLord Russell and some of the rest.For my part, I believe the crafty and\nambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the\npresent carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying\nthe monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable\nreasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and\nfelt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting\nup some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,\nwithout much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for\nwhich he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged\nto rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his\naccomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never\nsuccessful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox\ndied, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered\nor suspected.Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,\nas being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring\nto rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from\nPopery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much\napprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson\nand his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,\nand turn all things topsy-turvy.Of the same tragical principles is\nSydney.[Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot\n    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of\n    high treason in June, 1585.]I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous\nand wise prime President of Bordeaux.This gentleman was owner of that\nexcellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the\nchoicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what\nwas not so truly said of St.Paul, that much learning had made him mad.He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was\nexceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador\n[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant\nEastern Jews.He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome\nperson, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom\nI had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and\ngovernment of his son, since dead at sea.He had now been in Holland at\nthe sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare\nand curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers\nRoman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem.8, the\nnot hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;\nmuch after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short\nand broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the\npulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and\npractical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had\ngreater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to\nanswer for thriving no better on it.The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and\nconspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double\nguards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park\nshut up, few admitted to walk in it.The <DW7>s, in the meantime, very\njocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to\nnothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as\nthey called them.The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost\nmasters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna.On the other\nside, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)\ndisturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost\nall Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and\nall this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from\nour defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,\nambition, and to procure money for our vices.To this add our irreligion\nand atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,\nand the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so\nweak.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;\nevery moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to\nanything.The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not\nprovoke him till he bear it no longer!This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel\ntoward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had\nabandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard\nour coasts, or take cognizance of what they did;

he has\nlost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he\ncontinues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.He is a prudent old\ncourtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,\nthat costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,\nwhere I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:\nhappening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry\nParliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his\ngrandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke\nof York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage\nwith the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.To this they imputed\nmuch of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite\nat his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering\nparty, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.But perhaps\nas many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept\nthe government far steadier than it has proved since.I could name some\nwho I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the\nMISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore.It is true he was of a jolly temper,\nafter the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we\nwere become quite another nation.The Chancellor gone, and dying in\nexile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost L50,000 building, to\nthe young Duke of Albemarle for L25,000, to pay debts which how\ncontracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal.Some\nimagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him.However it\nwere, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious\nwaste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man\ndied.He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich\nbankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, L35,000;\nthey design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza\n[square].It is said they have already materials toward it with what\nthey sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it.See\nthe vicissitudes of earthly things!I was astonished at this demolition,\nnor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the\nground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense\nof L200,000, if they perfect their design.In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's\nworkhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading\nand oily metal.He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was\nold angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of L100\nstamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;\nwhich had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to\nScotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the\ncuriosi in antiquities and medals.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.We had now the welcome tidings of the King of\nPoland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all\nEurope, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in\nthe Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily\nswallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we\nsat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an\naccidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was\nintended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their\nrendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence.This made the King\nmore earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field\ndiversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient\ncastle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,\nair, pleasure, and provisions.The surveyor has already begun the\nfoundation for a palace, estimated to cost L35,000, and his Majesty is\npurchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n4th October, 1683.I went to London, on receiving a note from the\nCountess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might\nobtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of\nhis Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal\nmade me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent\ntransactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put\nupon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence\nwhereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home.At this\ntime, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced.He was held to be\nthe most learned of the judges, and an honest man.Sir George Jeffreys\nwas advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.Sir George\nTreby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure\nlawyer, set in his place.Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were\nremoved and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more\nwearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs\nholding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's\npleasure.The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world\nthus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse\nand thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in.Prudent men were for\nthe old foundations.Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the\nfew who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM\nwithin her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her\nmaids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants\nstanding about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich\nand splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice\npulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,\nwhile her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture\nand accommodation.Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for\ndesign, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best\npaintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with\nhuntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life\nrarely done.Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great\nvases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,\nbranches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides\nsome of her Majesty's best paintings.Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home\nto my poor, but quiet villa.What contentment can there be in the riches\nand splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to\nbed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to\nsee Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had\nmarried the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.It is a stately\nand ample palace.Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the\nfuneral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight\nwith the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or\nreception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room\nabove,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,\ncoloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the\nold masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome.In the rest of the\nchamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.The\ngarden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not\nanswerable to the inside.The court at entry, and wings for offices seem\ntoo near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the\ncorridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being\noverlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they\nplaced the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to\nspare.But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French\npavilion-way, by Mr.Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.There were\nwith us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the\ncelebrated traveler.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest\njudge.A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near\nWorcester, and very curious in gardening.I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord\nArlington his Majesty's High Steward.Came to visit and dine with me, Mr.Brisbane,\nSecretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to\nthe late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had\nseen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home.He had\nrepaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a\nniche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me\nover-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well\npainted _a fresco_.The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,\ncommunicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived.There is a\ncupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which\nbeing covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the\nrest there are too many fir trees in the garden.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n17th November, 1683.I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,\nfor the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the\neducation of my daughters.The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on\nthe pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this\nevening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various\ndiscourses.I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now\nlying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might\nsee it.She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,\nand full of virtue and sweetness.She discoursed with me of many\nparticulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making\nat Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most\nnoble that I had seen.The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of\nPortugal, her Majesty's brother.At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the\nKing sent us two does.I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,\na lieutenant-colonel of the city.He stands now about\nfive feet eight inches and a half.A short time ago, on coming down\nstairs in the morning, he observed to his daughter, with his accustomed\ngood humour, and buoyancy of spirit, \"I wonder what I shall dream next;\nI dreamt last night that I was going to be married again; and who knows\nbut I could find somebody that would have me yet.\"His son-in-law is an\nold grey-headed man, much harder of hearing than himself; and it\nfrequently happens, that when any of the family are endeavouring to\nexplain anything to him, old James will say, \"Stop, and I'll _insense_\nhim;\" and his lungs seldom fail in the undertaking.From this interesting family we learn, that William Horrocks, the father\nof the present James, of whom we have been speaking, was born in 1657,\nfour years after Oliver Cromwell was declared protector, and one year\nbefore his death.He would be two years old when Richard Cromwell, who\nsucceeded his father, resigned; and four years old when Charles II.The exact period of his first marriage we have not been\nable to ascertain; but it is certain that his bride was employed as\nnurse in the well-known family of the Chethams, either at Turton Tower,\nor at Castleton Hall, near Rochdale.By this marriage he had four\nchildren, as appears from the following memorandums, written in an\nexcellent hand in the back of an old black-letter Bible, printed in\n1583:\n\n  \"Mary, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Horrocks, was born\n  the 15th day of September, and baptised the 23d day of the same\n  month, Anno Dom.\"John, the son of William and Elizabeth Horrocks, was born the\n  18th day of January, and baptized the 25th day of the same month,\n  Anno Dom.\"Ann, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Horrocks, was born the\n  14th day of March, and baptized the 23d day of the same month,\n  Anno Dom.\"William, the son of William and Elisabeth Horrocks, was born the\n  9th day of June, and baptised the 17th day of the same month, Anno\n  Dom.At what time his wife died, we are also unable to ascertain; but there\nis no doubt he remained a widower for many years, and at length married\nhis housekeeper, a comely blooming young woman, whose kindness to the\nold man was unremitting, and he married her in 1741, at the age of\neighty-four, she being at the time only twenty-six.This marriage evidently attracted much attention in the neighbourhood,\nand we find that, about two years afterwards, the old man and his\nyouthful partner were sent for to Castleton Hall, the residence of a\nbranch of Humphry Chetham's family, where they were treated with great\nkindness, and a portrait painter engaged to take their likenesses, which\nare now in the possession of their son, and add much to the interest of\na visit to him.These portraits are well executed; and, of course,\nappear rather like those of a grandfather and his grandchild than of\nhusband and wife, although he appears more like sixty than eighty-six.In front of each painting is prominently inscribed the age of each of\nthe parties, and the date when the portrait was taken.Upon that of the\nhusband the inscription is, \"AETA: 86--1743.\"And upon that of the wife,\n\"AETA: 28--1743.\"These, it appears, were taken two years after their\nmarriage, and preserved in the Chetham family, at Castleton Hall, as\ngreat curiosities.In the following year, the present James was born, as appears from the\nfollowing entry on the back of the same old Bible:\n\n  \"James, the son of William and Elizabeth Horrocks of Bradshaw\n  Chapel, was born March 14th, 1744.\"He will therefore complete his hundredth year on the 14th of next March.He was born in a house near Bradshaw Chapel, which has long since been\nremoved.He was about twenty-seven years old when an uncle left him a\nsmall estate in Harwood, called Hill End; and soon after he married, we\nbelieve in 1773, and by that marriage had eight children.William, the\nson of James and Margaret Horrocks, was born February 21, 1776;\nMargaret, March 31, 1778; John, August 11, 1781; Simon, Dec.23, 1783;\nMatty, June 28, 1786; James, Jan.13, 1789; Sarah, Sept.22, 1791; and\nBetty, Jan.Of these, the only survivors are Margaret, aged sixty-five, the wife of\nJohn Haslam, with whom the old man now resides; and Betty, the youngest,\naged forty-nine, who is married, and has four children.The old man was only eleven years old when his father died, and has no\nrecollection of hearing him mention any remarkable event occurring in\nhis lifetime.On asking the old man how he came into possession of the portraits of\nhis father and mother, he stated, that, some years ago, he saw in the\nnewspapers a sale advertised of the property at Castleton Hall, and went\nthere before the day to inquire after the portraits, with the view of\npurchasing them before the sale.The servants at the hall admitted him,\nand he found they were not there.He then went to the house of the\nsteward, and found he was not at home; he, however, left a message,\ndesiring that the steward would send him word if there was any\nprobability of his being able to purchase the portraits.Accordingly,\nthe steward sent him word that they had been removed, with the family\nportraits, to the residence of a lady near Manchester, where he might\nhave the satisfaction of seeing them.The old man cannot remember either\nthe name or the address of the lady.However, he went to the place, in\ncompany with a friend, and saw the lady, who treated him with the\ngreatest kindness.She showed him the portraits, and was so much pleased\nwith the desire he manifested to purchase them, that she said, if she\ncould be certain that he was the heir, she would make him a present of\nthem, as his filial affection did him great honour.His friend assured\nher that he was the only child of his mother by William Horrocks, and\nshe then gave them to him, although she parted with them with regret, as\nshe had no other paintings that attracted so much attention.His\nrecollection of the circumstances are so perfect, that he remembers\noffering a gratuity to the servants for packing the portraits, which the\nlady would not allow them to receive.As an instance of the health and vigour of this remarkable old man, it\nmay be mentioned, that ten years ago, in the winter of 1832-3, he\nattended at Newton, to vote for Lord Molyneux, then a candidate for\nSouth Lancashire.He was then in his ninetieth year.He walked from\nHarwood to Bolton, a distance of three miles.From thence he went to\nNewton by the railway; and, having voted, he by some means missed the\ntrain, and walked to Bolton, a distance of fifteen miles.On arriving\nthere he took some refreshment, and again set out for Harwood, and\naccomplished the distance of twenty-one miles in the day, in the depth\nof winter.--_Manchester Guardian_, Aug._On a Passage in Sedley._--There is a couplet in Sir Charles Sedley's\npoems, which is quoted as follows in a work in my possession:\n\n      \"Let fools the name of loyalty divide:\n      Wise men and Gods are on the strongest side.\"or is it a misprint for\n\"deride?\"Of course, the latter word would completely alter the sense,\nbut it seems to me that it would make it more consistent with truth.The\nword \"divide\" supposes loyalty to be characteristic of fools, and places\nthe Gods in antagonism to that sentiment; while the word \"deride\"\nrestores them to their natural position._On a Passage in Romeo and Juliet._--In the encounter between Mercutio\nand Tybalt (Act III.), in which Mercutio is killed, he addresses\nTybalt tauntingly thus:--\n\n  \"Good king of cats, &c., will you pluck your sword out of his\n  _pilcher_ by the ears?Make haste, lest mine be about your ears\n  ere it be out.\"The first quarto has _scabbard_, all the later editions have _pilcher_,\na word occurring nowhere else.There has been a vain attempt to make\n_pilcher_ signify a _leathern sheath_, because a _pilch_ was a _garment\nof leather_ or _pelt_.To me it is quite evident that _pilcher_ is a\nmere typographical error for _pitcher_, which, in this jocose, bantering\nspeech, Mercutio substitutes for _scabbard_, else why are the _ears_\nmentioned?The poet was familiar with the proverb \"Pitchers have ears,\"\nof which he has elsewhere twice availed himself.The _ears_, as every\none knows, are the _handles_, which have since been called the _lugs_.Shakspeare would hardly have substituted a word of his own creation for\n_scabbard_; but _pitcher_ was suggested by the play upon the word\n_ears_, which is used for _hilts_ in the plural, according to the\nuniversal usage of the poet's time.The _ears_, applied to a _leathern\ncoat_, or even a _sheath_, would be quite unmeaning, but there is a well\nsustained ludicrous image in \"pluck your sword out of his _pitcher by\nthe ears_.\"_Inscription on a Tablet in Limerick Cathedral._--\n\n  \"Mementi Mory.\"Here lieth Littele Samuell Barinton, that great Under Taker, of\n  Famious Cittis Clock and Chime Maker;

Dyce when publishing his edition of Greene's works, your\nreaders may see a notice by Mr.Collier in his _Extracts from the\nRegistry of the Stat.233., apparently from the\npresent copy, no other being known.Besides the copy of the above work mentioned by your correspondent J. H.\nT., several others are known to exist in this country.Among them I may\nmention one in the library of the Baptist College, Bristol.My own copy\nwas supplied by a London bookseller, who has likewise imported several\nother copies from Holland, where it is by no means a scarce work.The second illustrated edition was published twenty years after the\ndecease of Van Braght.The first edition, without engravings, now before\nme, appeared in 1660, which was the edition used by Danvers.But Danvers\ndoes not appear to have known its existence, when the first edition of\nhis treatise came out in 1673.The \"large additions\" of his second\nedition in 1674, are chiefly made from the work of Van Braght.The original portion of Van Braght's work is, however, confined to the\nfirst part.The second part, _The Martyrology_, strictly so called, is\nof much earlier date.Many single narratives appeared at the time, and\ncollections of these were early made.The earliest collection of\nmartyrdoms bears the date of 1542.This was enlarged in 1562, 1578,\n1580, and 1595.This fact I give on the authority of Professor Mueller of\nAmsterdam, from the _Jaarboekje voor de Doopsgezinde Gemeenten in de\nNederlanden, 1838 en 1839_, pp.An edition, dated 1599, of these very rare books is now before me.It\nhas the following curious and affecting title:\n\n  \"Dit Boeck wort genaemt: Het Offer des Heeren, Om het inhout van\n  sommige opgeofferde Kinderen Gods, de welcke voort gebrocht\n  hebben, wt den goeden schat haers herten, Belijdinghen,\n  Sentbrieuen ende Testamenten, de welcke sy met den monde beleden,\n  ende met den bloede bezeghelt hebben, &c.By\n  my Peter Sebastiaenzoon, Int jaer ons Heeren MDXCIX.\"of 229 folios, and contains the martyrdoms of\nthirty-three persons (the first of which is Stephen), which were\nsubsequently embodied in the larger martyrologies.Each narrative is\nfollowed by a versified version of it.A small book of hymns is added,\nsome of them composed by the martyrs; and the letters and confession of\none Joos de Tollenaer, who was put to death at Ghent in 1589.In 1615, a large collection of these narratives appeared at Haarlem in a\nthick 4to.The compilers were Hans de Ries, Jaques Outerman, and\nJoost Govertsoon, all eminent Mennonite ministers.Two editions followed\nfrom the press of Zacharias Cornelis at Hoorn in 1617 and 1626, both in\n4to., but under different editorship.The last edition was offensive to\nthe Haarlem editors, who therefore published a fourth at Haarlem in\n1631.As its title is brief, I will give it from the copy in my library:\n\n  \"Martelaers Spiegel der Werelose Christenen t' zedert A. D.Gedrukt tot Haarlem Bij Hans\n  Passchiers van Wesbusch.In't Jaer onses Heeren, 1631.\"The title-page is from a copperplate,\nand is adorned with eight small engravings, representing scenes of\nsuffering and persecution from scripture.The narratives of martyrs\nextends from 1524 to 1624.It is this work which forms the basis of Van\nBraght's.He added to it the whole of his first part, and also some\nadditional narratives in the second.To the best of his ability he\nverified the whole.These works are frequently referred to by Ottius in his _Annales\nAnabaptistici_ under the titles \"Martyrologium Harlemense\" and\n\"Martyrologium Hornanum.\"From a paper in the _Archivs fuer Kunde oesterreichischer\nGeschichtsquellen_, I learn that a MS.exists in the City library of\nHamburgh, with the following title:\n\n  \"Chronickel oder Denkbueechel darinnen mit kurtzen Begriffen, Was\n  sich vom 1524 Jar, Bis auff gegenwaertige Zeit, in der gemain\n  zuegetragen, vnd wie viel trewer Zeugen Jesu Christij die warheit\n  Gottes so riterlich mit irem bluet bezeugt.The work appears chiefly confined to a history of the Moravian\nAnabaptists: but from passages given by the writer, Herr Gregor Wolny,\nit is evident that it contains many of the narratives given by Van\nBraght.was written previous to 1592,\nwhen its writer or compiler died.Three continuators carried on the\nnarrations to 1654.The last date in it is June 7, 1654; when Daniel\nZwicker, in his own handwriting, records his settlement as pastor over a\nBaptist church.by Ottius, and by Fischer in\nhis _Tauben-kobel_, p.33., &c. For any additional particulars\nrespecting it, I should feel greatly obliged.It does not appear to be known to your correspondent that a translation\nof the second part of Van Braght's work has been commenced in this\ncountry, of which the first volume was issued by the Hanserd Knollys\nSociety last year.A translation of the entire work appeared in 1837, in\nPennsylvania, U. S., for the use of the Mennonite churches, emigrants\nfrom Holland and Germany to whom the language of their native land had\nbecome a strange tongue.).--The corresponding _German_\nword is _Spann-nagel-neu_, which may be translated as \"New from the\nstretching needle;\" and corroborates the meaning given by you.I may\nremark the French have no equivalent phrase.It is evidently a familiar\nallusion of the clothmakers of England and Germany.).--There is an old Club in this\ntown (Birmingham) called the \"Bear Club,\" and established (ut dic.)circa 1738, formerly of some repute.Among other legends of the Club, is\none, that in the centre of the ceiling of their dining-room was once a\ncarved rose, and that the members always drank as a first toast, to \"The\nhealth of the King,\" [under the rose], meaning the Pretender._Handel's Occasional Oratorio_ (Vol.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.).--The \"Occasional\nOratorio\" is a separate composition, containing an overture, 10\nrecitatives, 21 airs, 1 duet, and 15 choruses.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.It was produced in the\nyear 1745.It is reported, I know not on what authority, that the King\nhaving ordered Handel to produce a new oratorio on a given day, and the\nartist having answered that it was impossible to do it in the time\n(which must have been unreasonably short, to extort such a reply from\nthe intellect that produced _The Messiah_ in three weeks, and _Israel in\nEgypt_ in four), his Majesty deigned no other answer than that done it\nmust and should be, whether possible or not, and that the result was the\nputting forward of the \"Occasional Oratorio.\"The structure of the oratorio, which was evidently a very hurried\ncomposition, gives a strong air of probability to the anecdote.Evidently no libretto was written for it; the words tell no tale, are\ntotally unconnected, and not even always tolerable English, a fine\nchorus (p.Arnold) going to the words \"Him or his God we no fear.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.It is rather a collection of sacred pieces, strung together literally\nwithout rhyme or reason in the oratorio form, than one oratorio.The\nexamination of it leads one to the conclusion, that the composer took\nfrom his portfolio such pieces as he happened to have at hand, strung\nthem together as he best could, and made up the necessary quantity by\nselections from his other works.Accordingly we find in it the pieces\n\"The Horse and his Rider,\" \"Thou shalt bring them in,\" \"Who is like unto\nThee?\"\"The Hailstone Chorus,\" \"The Enemy said I will pursue,\" from\n_Israel in Egypt_, written in 1738; the chorus \"May God from whom all\nMercies spring,\" from _Athaliah_ (1733); and the chorus \"God save the\nKing, long live the King,\" from the _Coronation Anthem_ of 1727.Liberty,\" which he afterwards (in 1746) employed in\n_Judas Maccabaeus_.Possibly some other pieces of this oratorio may be\nfound also in some of Handel's other works, not sufficiently stamped on\nmy memory for me to recognise them; but I may remark that the quantity\nof _Israel in Egypt_ found in it may perhaps have so connected it in\nsome minds with that glorious composition as to have led to the practice\nreferred to of prefixing in performance the overture to the latter work,\nto which, although the introductory movement, the fine adagio, and grand\nmarch are fit enough, the light character of the fugue is, it must be\nconfessed, singularly inappropriate.I am not aware of any other \"occasion\" than that of the King's will,\nwhich led to the composition of this oratorio.).--They are found in the ancient\nchurches in Ireland, and some are preserved in the Museum of the Royal\nIrish Academy, and in private collections.A beautiful specimen is\nengraved in Wakeman's _Handbook of Irish Antiquities_, p.).--The charge for a\n\"Thanksgiving Book,\" mentioned by A CHURCHWARDEN, was no doubt for a\nBook of Prayers, &c., on some general thanksgiving day, probably after\nthe battle of Blenheim and the taking of Gibraltar, which would be about\nthe month of November.A similar charge appears in the Churchwardens'\naccounts for the parish of _Eye, Suffolk_, at a much earlier period,\nviz.1684, which you may probably deem worthy of insertion in your\npages:\n\n      \"_Payments._                                      _l._ _s._ _d._\n\n      \"It.To Flegg for sweepinge and dressinge\n      upp the church the nynth\n      of September beeinge A day of\n      _Thanks-givinge_ for his Ma'ties\n      deliv'ance from the Newkett\n      Plot                                               00   03   00\n\n      \"It.For twoe _Bookes_ for the 9th of September\n      aforesaid                                          00   01   00\"\n\n    J.

H. P. as assigned to Plautus, and which he says he cannot\nfind in that author, occurs in one of the interpolated scenes in the\n_Mercator_, which are placed in some of the old editions between the 5th\nand 6th Scenes of Act IV.In the edition by Pareus, printed at Neustadt\n(Neapolis Nemetum) in 1619, 4to., it stands thus:\n\n  \"Verum id dictum est: Feliciter is sapit, qui periculo alieno\n  sapit.\"I was wrong in attributing it to Plautus, and should rather have called\nit _Plautine_.By a strange slip of the pen or the press, pericu_lum_ is\nput instead of pericu_lo_ in my note.Niebuhr has a very interesting\nessay on the interpolated scenes in Plautus, in the first volume of his\n_Kleine Historische und Philologische Schriften_, which will show why\nthese scenes and passages, marked as supposititious in some editions,\nare now omitted.It appears that they were made in the fifteenth century\nby Hermolaus Barbarus.See a letter from him to the Bishop of Segni, in\n_Angeli Politiani Epistolae_, lib.To the parallel thoughts already cited may be added the following:\n\n  \"Ii qui sciunt, quid aliis acciderit, facile ex aliorum eventu,\n  suis rationibus possunt providere.\"\"I' presi esempio de' lor stati rei,\n      Facendomi profitto l' altrui male\n      In consolar i casi e dolor miei.\"Petrarca, _Trionfo della Castita_.\"Ben' e felice quel, donne mie care,\n      Ch' essere accorto all' altrui spese impare.\"Fur._, canto X.\n\n    S.

and yet free egress is\nrequired between them (into balconies) which is obtained by doors in\ntheir lattice glazing.To prevent the inconvenience and ugliness of\ndriving the hinges and fastenings of them into the shafts, and having\nthe play of the doors in the intervals, the entire glazing is thrown\nbehind the pillars, and attached to their abaci and bases with iron.It\nis thus securely sustained by their massy bulk, and leaves their\nsymmetry and shade undisturbed.The depth at which the glass should be placed, in windows\nwithout traceries, will generally be fixed by the forms of their\nbevelling, the glass occupying the narrowest interval; but when its\nposition is not thus fixed, as in many London houses, it is to be\nremembered that the deeper the glass is set (the wall being of given\nthickness), the more light will enter, and the clearer the prospect\nwill be to a person sitting quietly in the centre of the room; on the\ncontrary, the farther out the glass is set, the more convenient the\nwindow will be for a person rising and looking out of it.The one,\ntherefore, is an arrangement for the idle and curious, who care only\nabout what is going on upon the earth: the other for those who are\nwilling to remain at rest, so that they have free admission of the light\nof Heaven.This might be noted as a curious expressional reason for the\nnecessity (of which no man of ordinary feeling would doubt for a moment)\nof a deep recess in the window, on the outside, to all good or\narchitectural effect: still, as there is no reason why people should be\nmade idle by having it in their power to look out of window, and as the\nslight increase of light or clearness of view in the centre of a room is\nmore than balanced by the loss of space, and the greater chill of the\nnearer glass and outside air, we can, I fear, allege no other structural\nreason for the picturesque external recess, than the expediency of a\ncertain degree of protection, for the glass, from the brightest glare of\nsunshine, and heaviest rush of rain.FOOTNOTES:\n\n  [58] \"Seven Lamps,\" p.[59] On the north side of the nave of the cathedral of Lyons, there\n    is an early French window, presenting one of the usual groups of\n    foliated arches and circles, left, as it were, loose, without any\n    enclosing curve.This remarkable window\n    is associated with others of the common form.I. We have hitherto considered the aperture as merely pierced in the\nthickness of the walls; and when its masonry is simple and the fillings\nof the aperture are unimportant, it may well remain so.But when the\nfillings are delicate and of value, as in the case of  glass,\nfinely wrought tracery, or sculpture, such as we shall often find\noccupying the tympanum of doorways, some protection becomes necessary\nagainst the run of the rain down the walls, and back by the bevel of the\naperture to the joints or surface of the fillings.The first and simplest mode of obtaining this is by channelling\nthe jambs and arch head; and this is the chief practical service of\naperture mouldings, which are otherwise entirely decorative.But as this\nvery decorative character renders them unfit to be made channels for\nrain water, it is well to add some external roofing to the aperture,\nwhich may protect it from the run of all the rain, except that which\nnecessarily beats into its own area.This protection, in its most usual\nform, is a mere dripstone moulding carried over or round the head of the\naperture.But this is, in reality, only a contracted form of a true\n_roof_, projecting from the wall over the aperture; and all protections\nof apertures whatsoever are to be conceived as portions of small roofs,\nattached to the wall behind; and supported by it, so long as their scale\nadmits of their being so with safety, and afterwards in such manner as\nmay be most expedient.The proper forms of these, and modes of their\nsupport, are to be the subject of our final enquiry.Respecting their proper form we need not stay long in doubt.A\ndeep gable is evidently the best for throwing off rain; even a low gable\nbeing better than a high arch.Flat roofs, therefore, may only be used\nwhen the nature of the building renders the gable unsightly; as when\nthere is not room for it between the stories; or when the object is\nrather shade than protection from rain, as often in verandahs and\nbalconies.But for general service the gable is the proper and natural\nform, and may be taken as representative of the rest.Then this gable\nmay either project unsupported from the wall, _a_, Fig.XLVIII., or be\ncarried by brackets or spurs, _b_, or by walls or shafts, _c_, which\nshafts or walls may themselves be, in windows, carried on a sill; and\nthis, in its turn, supported by brackets or spurs.We shall glance at\nthe applications of each of these forms in order.There is not much variety in the case of the first, _a_, Fig.In the Cumberland and border cottages the door is generally\nprotected by two pieces of slate arranged in a gable, giving the purest\npossible type of the first form.In elaborate architecture such a\nprojection hardly ever occurs, and in large architecture cannot with\nsafety occur, without brackets; but by cutting away the greater part of\nthe projection, we shall arrive at the idea of a plain gabled cornice,\nof which a perfect example will be found in Plate VII.With this first complete form we may associate the rude, single,\nprojecting, penthouse roof; imperfect, because either it must be level\nand the water lodge lazily upon it, or throw off the drip upon the\npersons entering.This is a most beautiful and natural type,\nand is found in all good architecture, from the highest to the most\nhumble: it is a frequent form of cottage door, more especially when\ncarried on spurs, being of peculiarly easy construction in wood: as\napplied to large architecture, it can evidently be built, in its boldest\nand simplest form, either of wood only, or on a scale which will admit of\nits sides being each a single slab of stone.If so large as to require\njointed masonry, the gabled sides will evidently require support, and an\narch must be thrown across under them, as in Fig.If we cut the projection gradually down, we arrive at the common Gothic\ngable dripstone carried on small brackets, carved into bosses, heads, or\nsome other ornamental form; the sub-arch in such case being useless, is\nremoved or coincides with the arch head of the aperture.Substituting walls or pillars for the\nbrackets, we may carry the projection as far out as we choose, and form\nthe perfect porch, either of the cottage or village church, or of the\ncathedral.As we enlarge the structure, however, certain modifications\nof form become necessary, owing to the increased boldness of the\nrequired supporting arch.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.For, as the lower end of the gabled roof and\nof the arch cannot coincide, we have necessarily above the shafts one of\nthe two forms _a_ or _b_, in Fig.L., of which the latter is clearly the\nbest, requiring less masonry and shorter roofing; and when the arch\nbecomes so large as to cause a heavy lateral thrust, it may become\nnecessary to provide for its farther safety by pinnacles, _c_.This last is the perfect type of aperture protection.None other can\never be invented so good.It is that once employed by Giotto in the\ncathedral of Florence, and torn down by the proveditore, Benedetto\nUguccione, to erect a Renaissance front instead; and another such has\nbeen destroyed, not long since, in Venice, the porch of the church of\nSt.Apollinare, also to put up some Renaissance upholstery: for\nRenaissance, as if it were not nuisance enough in the mere fact of its\nown existence, appears invariably as a beast of prey, and founds itself\non the ruin of all that is best and noblest.Many such porches, however,\nhappily still exist in Italy, and are among its principal glories.When porches of this kind, carried by walls, are placed close\ntogether, as in cases where there are many and large entrances to a\ncathedral front, they would, in their general form, leave deep and\nuncomfortable intervals, in which damp would lodge and grass grow; and\nthere would be a painful feeling in approaching the door in the midst of\na crowd, as if some of them might miss the real doors, and be driven\ninto the intervals, and embayed there.Clearly it will be a natural and\nright expedient, in such cases, to open the walls of the porch wider, so\nthat they may correspond in <DW72>, or nearly so, with the bevel of the\ndoorway, and either meet each other in the intervals, or have the said\nintervals closed up with an intermediate wall, so that nobody may get\nembayed in them.The porches will thus be united, and form one range of\ngreat open gulphs or caverns, ready to receive all comers, and direct\nthe current of the crowd into the narrower entrances.As the lateral\nthrust of the arches is now met by each other, the pinnacles, if there\nwere any, must be removed, and waterspouts placed between each arch to\ndischarge the double drainage of the gables.This is the form of all the\nnoble northern porches, without exception, best represented by that of\nRheims.Contracted conditions of the pinnacle porch are beautifully\nused in the doors of the cathedral of Florence; and the entire\narrangement, in its most perfect form, as adapted to window protection and\ndecoration, is applied by Giotto with inconceivable exquisiteness in the\nwindows of the campanile; those of the cathedral itself being all of the\nsame type.Various singular and delightful conditions of it are applied\nin Italian domestic architecture (in the Broletto of Monza very\nquaintly), being associated with balconies for speaking to the people,\nand passing into pulpits.In the north we glaze the sides of such\nprojections, and they become bow-windows, the shape of roofing being\nthen nearly immaterial and very fantastic, often a conical cap.All\nthese conditions of window protection, being for real service, are\nendlessly delightful (and I believe the beauty of the balcony, protected\nby an open canopy supported by light shafts, never yet to have been\nproperly worked out).But the Renaissance architects destroyed all of\nthem, and introduced the magnificent and witty Roman invention of a\nmodel of a Greek pediment, with its cornices of monstrous thickness,\nbracketed up above the window.The horizontal cornice of the pediment is\nthus useless, and of course, therefore, retained; the protection to the\nhead of the window being constructed on the principle of a hat with its\ncrown sewn up.But the deep and dark triangular cavity thus obtained\naffords farther opportunity for putting ornament out of sight, of which\nthe Renaissance architects are not slow to avail themselves.A more rational condition is the complete pediment with a couple of\nshafts, or pilasters, carried on a bracketed sill; and the windows of\nthis kind, which have been well designed, are perhaps the best things\nwhich the Renaissance schools have produced: those of Whitehall are, in\ntheir way, exceedingly beautiful; and those of the Palazzo Ricardi at\nFlorence, in their simplicity and sublimity, are scarcely unworthy of\ntheir reputed designer, Michael Angelo.I. The reader has now some knowledge of every feature of all possible\narchitecture.Whatever the nature of the building which may be submitted\nto his criticism, if it be an edifice at all, if it be anything else\nthan a mere heap of stones like a pyramid or breakwater, or than a large\nstone hewn into shape, like an obelisk, it will be instantly and easily\nresolvable into some of the parts which we have been hitherto\nconsidering: its pinnacles will separate themselves into their small\nshafts and roofs; its supporting members into shafts and arches, or\nwalls penetrated by apertures of various shape, and supported by various\nkinds of buttresses.Respecting each of these several features I am\ncertain that the reader feels himself prepared, by understanding their\nplain function, to form something like a reasonable and definite\njudgment, whether they be good or bad; and this right judgment of parts\nwill, in most cases, lead him to just reverence or condemnation of the\nwhole.The various modes in which these parts are capable of\ncombination, and the merits of buildings of different form and expression,\nare evidently not reducible into lists, nor to be estimated by general\nlaws.The nobility of each building depends on its special fitness for its\nown purposes; and these purposes vary with every climate, every soil, and\nevery national custom: nay, there were never, probably, two edifices\nerected in which some accidental difference of condition did not require\nsome difference of plan or of structure; so that, respecting plan and\ndistribution of parts, I do not hope to collect any universal law of\nright; but there are a few points necessary to be noticed respecting the\nmeans by which height is attained in buildings of various plans, and\nthe expediency and methods of superimposition of one story or tier of\narchitecture above another.For, in the preceding inquiry, I have always supposed either\nthat a single shaft would reach to the top of the building, or that the\nfarther height required might be added in plain wall above the heads of\nthe arches; whereas it may often be rather expedient to complete the\nentire lower series of arches, or finish the lower wall, with a bold\nstring course or cornice, and build another series of shafts, or another\nwall, on the top of it.This superimposition is seen in its simplest form in the interior\nshafts of a Greek temple; and it has been largely used in nearly all\ncountries where buildings have been meant for real service.Outcry has\noften been raised against it, but the thing is so sternly necessary that\nit has always forced itself into acceptance; and it would, therefore, be\nmerely losing time to refute the arguments of those who have attempted\nits disparagement.Thus far, however, they have reason on their side,\nthat if a building can be kept in one grand mass, without sacrificing\neither its visible or real adaptation to its objects, it is not well to\ndivide it into stories until it has reached proportions too large to be\njustly measured by the eye.It ought then to be divided in order to mark\nits bulk; and decorative divisions are often possible, which rather\nincrease than destroy the expression of general unity.V. Superimposition, wisely practised, is of two kinds, directly\ncontrary to each other, of weight on lightness, and of lightness on\nweight; while the superimposition of weight on weight, or lightness on\nlightness, is nearly always wrong.Weight on lightness: I do not say weight on _weakness_.The\nsuperimposition of the human body on its limbs I call weight on\nlightness: the superimposition of the branches on a tree trunk I call\nlightness on weight: in both cases the support is fully adequate to the\nwork, the form of support being regulated by the differences of\nrequirement.Nothing in architecture is half so painful as the apparent\nwant of sufficient support when the weight above is visibly passive:\nfor all buildings are not passive; some seem to rise by their own\nstrength, or float by their own buoyancy; a dome requires no visibility\nof support, one fancies it supported by the air.But passive\narchitecture without help for its passiveness is unendurable.In a\nlately built house, No.86, in Oxford Street, three huge stone pillars\nin the second story are carried apparently by the edges of three sheets\nof plate glass in the first.I hardly know anything to match the\npainfulness of this and some other of our shop structures, in which the\niron-work is concealed; nor, even when it is apparent, can the eye ever\nfeel satisfied of their security, when built, as at present, with fifty\nor sixty feet of wall above a rod of iron not the width of this page.The proper forms of this superimposition of weight on lightness\nhave arisen, for the most part, from the necessity or desirableness, in\nmany situations, of elevating the inhabited portions of buildings\nconsiderably above the ground level, especially those exposed to damp or\ninundation, and the consequent abandonment of the ground story as\nunserviceable, or else the surrender of it to public purposes.Thus, in\nmany market and town houses, the ground story is left open as a general\nplace of sheltered resort, and the enclosed apartments raised on\npillars.In almost all warm countries the luxury, almost the necessity,\nof arcades to protect the passengers from the sun, and the desirableness\nof large space in the rooms above, lead to the same construction.Throughout the Venetian islet group, the houses seem to have been thus,\nin the first instance, universally built, all the older palaces\nappearing to have had the rez de chaussee perfectly open, the upper\nparts of the palace being sustained on magnificent arches, and the\nsmaller houses sustained in the same manner on wooden piers, still\nretained in many of the cortiles, and exhibited characteristically\nthroughout the main street of Murano.As ground became more valuable and\nhouse-room more scarce, these ground-floors were enclosed with wall\nveils between the original shafts, and so remain; but the type of the\nstructure of the entire city is given in the Ducal Palace.To this kind of superimposition we owe the most picturesque\nstreet effects throughout the world, and the most graceful, as well as\nthe most grotesque, buildings, from the many-shafted fantasy of the\nAlhambra (a building as beautiful in disposition as it is base in\nornamentation) to the four-legged stolidity of the Swiss Chalet:[60] nor\nthese only, but great part of the effect of our cathedrals, in which,\nnecessarily, the close triforium and clerestory walls are superimposed\non the nave piers; perhaps with most majesty where with greatest\nsimplicity, as in the old basilican types, and the noble cathedral of\nPisa.In order to the delightfulness and security of all such\narrangements, this law must be observed:--that in proportion to the\nheight of wall above them, the shafts are to be short.You may take your\ngiven height of wall, and turn any quantity of that wall into shaft that\nyou like; but you must not turn it all into tall shafts, and then put\nmore wall above.Thus, having a house five stories high, you may turn\nthe lower story into shafts, and leave the four stories in wall; or the\ntwo lower stories into shafts, and leave three in wall; but, whatever\nyou add to the shaft, you must take from the wall.Then also, of course,\nthe shorter the shaft the thicker will be its _proportionate_, if not\nits actual, diameter.In the Ducal Palace of Venice the shortest shafts\nare always the thickest.The second kind of superimposition, lightness on weight, is, in\nits most necessary use, of stories of houses one upon another, where, of\ncourse, wall veil is required in the lower ones, and has to support wall\nveil above, aided by as", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "The greatest, if not the only, merit of the Roman and\nRenaissance Venetian architects is their graceful management of this\nkind of superimposition; sometimes of complete courses of external\narches and shafts one above the other; sometimes of apertures with\nintermediate cornices at the levels of the floors, and large shafts from\ntop to bottom of the building; always observing that the upper stories\nshall be at once lighter and richer than the lower ones.The entire\nvalue of such buildings depends upon the perfect and easy expression of\nthe relative strength of the stories, and the unity obtained by the\nvarieties of their proportions, while yet the fact of superimposition\nand separation by floors is frankly told.X. In churches and other buildings in which there is no separation\nby floors, another kind of pure shaft superimposition is often used, in\norder to enable the builder to avail himself of short and slender\nshafts.It has been noted that these are often easily attainable, and of\nprecious materials, when shafts large enough and strong enough to do the\nwork at once, could not be obtained except at unjustifiable expense, and\nof coarse stone.The architect has then no choice but to arrange his\nwork in successive stories; either frankly completing the arch work and\ncornice of each, and beginning a new story above it, which is the\nhonester and nobler way, or else tying the stories together by\nsupplementary shafts from floor to roof,--the general practice of the\nNorthern Gothic, and one which, unless most gracefully managed, gives\nthe look of a scaffolding, with cross-poles tied to its uprights, to the\nwhole clerestory wall.The best method is that which avoids all chance\nof the upright shafts being supposed continuous, by increasing their\nnumber and changing their places in the upper stories, so that the whole\nwork branches from the ground like a tree.This is the superimposition\nof the Byzantine and the Pisan Romanesque; the most beautiful examples\nof it being, I think, the Southern portico of St.Mark's, the church of\nS. Giovanni at Pistoja, and the apse of the cathedral of Pisa.In\nRenaissance work the two principles are equally distinct, though the\nshafts are (I think) always one above the other.The reader may see one\nof the best examples of the separately superimposed story in Whitehall\n(and another far inferior in St.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Paul's), and by turning himself round\nat Whitehall may compare with it the system of connecting shafts in the\nTreasury; though this is a singularly bad example, the window cornices\nof the first floor being like shelves in a cupboard, and cutting the\nmass of the building in two, in spite of the pillars.But this superimposition of lightness on weight is still more\ndistinctly the system of many buildings of the kind which I have above\ncalled Architecture of Position, that is to say, architecture of which\nthe greater part is intended merely to keep something in a peculiar\nposition; as in light-houses, and many towers and belfries.The subject\nof spire and tower architecture, however, is so interesting and\nextensive, that I have thoughts of writing a detached essay upon it,\nand, at all events, cannot enter upon it here: but this much is enough\nfor the reader to note for our present purpose, that, although many\ntowers do in reality stand on piers or shafts, as the central towers of\ncathedrals, yet the expression of all of them, and the real structure of\nthe best and strongest, are the elevation of gradually diminishing\nweight on massy or even solid foundation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Nevertheless, since the tower\nis in its origin a building for strength of defence, and faithfulness of\nwatch, rather than splendor of aspect, its true expression is of just so\nmuch diminution of weight upwards as may be necessary to its fully\nbalanced strength, not a jot more.There must be no light-headedness in\nyour noble tower: impregnable foundation, wrathful crest, with the vizor\ndown, and the dark vigilance seen through the clefts of it; not the\nfiligree crown or embroidered cap.No towers are so grand as the\nsquare-browed ones, with massy cornices and rent battlements: next to\nthese come the fantastic towers, with their various forms of steep roof;\nthe best, not the cone, but the plain gable thrown very high; last of\nall in my mind (of good towers), those with spires or crowns, though\nthese, of course, are fittest for ecclesiastical purposes, and capable\nof the richest ornament.The paltry four or eight pinnacled things we\ncall towers in England (as in York Minster), are mere confectioner's\nGothic, and not worth classing.But, in all of them, this I believe to be a point of chief\nnecessity,--that they shall seem to stand, and shall verily stand, in\ntheir own strength; not by help of buttresses nor artful balancings on\nthis side and on that.Your noble tower must need no help, must be\nsustained by no crutches, must give place to no suspicion of\ndecrepitude.Its office may be to withstand war, look forth for tidings,\nor to point to heaven: but it must have in its own walls the strength to\ndo this; it is to be itself a bulwark, not to be sustained by other\nbulwarks; to rise and look forth, \"the tower of Lebanon that looketh\ntoward Damascus,\" like a stern sentinel, not like a child held up in its\nnurse's arms.A tower may, indeed, have a kind of buttress, a\nprojection, or subordinate tower at each of its angles; but these are to\nits main body like the satellites to a shaft, joined with its strength,\nand associated in its uprightness, part of the tower itself: exactly in\nthe proportion in which they lose their massive unity with its body and\nassume the form of true buttress walls set on its angles, the tower\nloses its dignity.These two characters, then, are common to all noble towers,\nhowever otherwise different in purpose or feature,--the first, that they\nrise from massy foundation to lighter summits, frowning with battlements\nperhaps, but yet evidently more pierced and thinner in wall than\nbeneath, and, in most ecclesiastical examples, divided into rich open\nwork: the second, that whatever the form of the tower, it shall not\nappear to stand by help of buttresses.It follows from the first\ncondition, as indeed it would have followed from ordinary aesthetic\nrequirements, that we shall have continual variation in the arrangements\nof the stories, and the larger number of apertures towards the top,--a\ncondition exquisitely carried out in the old Lombardic towers, in which,\nhowever small they may be, the number of apertures is always regularly\nincreased towards the summit; generally one window in the lowest\nstories, two in the second, then three, five, and six; often, also,\none, two, four, and six, with beautiful symmetries of placing, not at\npresent to our purpose.We may sufficiently exemplify the general laws\nof tower building by placing side by side, drawn to the same scale, a\nmediaeval tower, in which most of them are simply and unaffectedly\nobserved, and one of our own modern towers, in which every one of them\nis violated, in small space, convenient for comparison.Mark's at Venice, not a very\nperfect example, for its top is Renaissance, but as good Renaissance as\nthere is in Venice; and it is fit for our present purpose, because it owes\nnone of its effect to ornament.It is built as simply as it well can be to\nanswer its purpose: no buttresses; no external features whatever, except\nsome huts at the base, and the loggia, afterwards built, which, on\npurpose, I have not drawn; one bold square mass of brickwork; double\nwalls, with an ascending inclined plane between them, with apertures as\nsmall as possible, and these only in necessary places, giving just the\nlight required for ascending the stair or <DW72>, not a ray more; and the\nweight of the whole relieved only by the double pilasters on the sides,\nsustaining small arches at the top of the mass, each decorated with the\nscallop or cockle shell, presently to be noticed as frequent in\nRenaissance ornament, and here, for once, thoroughly well applied.Then,\nwhen the necessary height is reached, the belfry is left open, as in the\nordinary Romanesque campanile, only the shafts more slender, but severe\nand simple, and the whole crowned by as much spire as the tower would\ncarry, to render it more serviceable as a landmark.The arrangement is\nrepeated in numberless campaniles throughout Italy.The one beside it is one of those of the lately built college at\nEdinburgh.I have not taken it as worse than many others (just as I have\nnot taken the St.Mark's tower as better than many others); but it\nhappens to compress our British system of tower building into small\nspace.The Venetian tower rises 350 feet,[62] and has no buttresses,\nthough built of brick; the British tower rises 121 feet, and is built\nof stone, but is supposed to be incapable of standing without two huge\nbuttresses on each angle.Mark's tower has a high sloping roof,\nbut carries it simply, requiring no pinnacles at its angles; the British\ntower has no visible roof, but has four pinnacles for mere ornament.The\nVenetian tower has its lightest part at the top, and is massy at the\nbase; the British tower has its lightest part at the base, and shuts up\nits windows into a mere arrowslit at the top.What the tower was built\nfor at all must therefore, it seems to me, remain a mystery to every\nbeholder; for surely no studious inhabitant of its upper chambers will\nbe conceived to be pursuing his employments by the light of the single\nchink on each side; and, had it been intended for a belfry, the sound of\nits bells would have been as effectually prevented from getting out as\nthe light from getting in.In connexion with the subject of towers and of superimposition,\none other feature, not conveniently to be omitted from our\nhouse-building, requires a moment's notice,--the staircase.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.In modern houses it can hardly be considered an architectural feature,\nand is nearly always an ugly one, from its being apparently without\nsupport.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.And here I may not unfitly note the important distinction,\nwhich perhaps ought to have been dwelt upon in some places before now,\nbetween the _marvellous_ and the _perilous_ in apparent construction.There are many edifices which are awful or admirable in their height,\nand lightness, and boldness of form, respecting which, nevertheless, we\nhave no fear that they should fall.Many a mighty dome and aerial aisle\nand arch may seem to stand, as I said, by miracle, but by steadfast\nmiracle notwithstanding; there is no fear that the miracle should cease.We have a sense of inherent power in them, or, at all events, of\nconcealed and mysterious provision for their safety.But in leaning\ntowers, as of Pisa or Bologna, and in much minor architecture, passive\narchitecture, of modern times, we feel that there is but a chance\nbetween the building and destruction; that there is no miraculous life\nin it, which animates it into security, but an obstinate, perhaps vain,\nresistance to immediate danger.The appearance of this is often as\nstrong in small things as in large; in the sounding-boards of pulpits,\nfor instance, when sustained by a single pillar behind them, so that one\nis in dread, during the whole sermon, of the preacher being crushed if a\nsingle nail should give way; and again, the modern geometrical\nunsupported staircase.There is great disadvantage, also, in the\narrangement of this latter, when room is of value; and excessive\nungracefulness in its awkward divisions of the passage walls, or\nwindows.In mediaeval architecture, where there was need of room, the\nstaircase was spiral, and enclosed generally in an exterior tower, which\nadded infinitely to the picturesque effect of the building; nor was the\nstair itself steeper nor less commodious than the ordinary compressed\nstraight staircase of a modern dwelling-house.Many of the richest\ntowers of domestic architecture owe their origin to this arrangement.In\nItaly the staircase is often in the open air, surrounding the interior\ncourt of the house, and giving access to its various galleries or\nloggias: in this case it is almost always supported by bold shafts and\narches, and forms a most interesting additional feature of the cortile,\nbut presents no peculiarity of construction requiring our present\nexamination.We may here, therefore, close our inquiries into the subject of\nconstruction; nor must the reader be dissatisfied with the simplicity or\napparent barrenness of their present results.He will find, when he\nbegins to apply them, that they are of more value than they now seem;\nbut I have studiously avoided letting myself be drawn into any intricate\nquestion, because I wished to ask from the reader only so much attention\nas it seemed that even the most indifferent would not be unwilling to\npay to a subject which is hourly becoming of greater practical interest.Evidently it would have been altogether beside the purpose of this essay\nto have entered deeply into the abstract science, or closely into the\nmechanical detail, of construction: both have been illustrated by\nwriters far more capable of doing so than I, and may be studied at the\nreader's discretion; all that has been here endeavored was the leading\nhim to appeal to something like definite principle, and refer to the\neasily intelligible laws of convenience and necessity, whenever he found\nhis judgment likely to be overborne by authority on the one hand, or\ndazzled by novelty on the other.If he has time to do more, and to\nfollow out in all their brilliancy the mechanical inventions of the\ngreat engineers and architects of the day, I, in some sort, envy him,\nbut must part company with him: for my way lies not along the viaduct,\nbut down the quiet valley which its arches cross, nor through the\ntunnel, but up the hill-side which its cavern darkens, to see what gifts\nNature will give us, and with what imagery she will fill our thoughts,\nthat the stones we have ranged in rude order may now be touched with\nlife; nor lose for ever, in their hewn nakedness, the voices they had of\nold, when the valley streamlet eddied round them in palpitating light,\nand the winds of the hill-side shook over them the shadows of the fern.FOOTNOTES:\n\n  [60] I have spent much of my life among the Alps; but I never pass,\n    without some feeling of new surprise, the Chalet, standing on its\n    four pegs (each topped with a flat stone), balanced in the fury of\n    Alpine winds.It is not, perhaps, generally known that the chief use\n    of the arrangement is not so much to raise the building above the\n    snow, as to get a draught of wind beneath it, which may prevent the\n    drift from rising against its sides.[61] Appendix 20, \"Shafts of the Ducal Palace.\"[62] I have taken Professor Willis's estimate; there being discrepancy\n    among various statements.I did not take the trouble to measure the\n    height myself, the building being one which does not come within the\n    range of our future inquiries; and its exact dimensions, even here,\n    are of no importance as respects the question at issue.I. We enter now on the second division of our subject.We have no\nmore to do with heavy stones and hard lines; we are going to be happy:\nto look round in the world and discover (in a serious manner always,\nhowever, and under a sense of responsibility) what we like best in it,\nand to enjoy the same at our leisure: to gather it, examine it, fasten\nall we can of it into imperishable forms, and put it where we may see it\nfor ever.There are, therefore, three steps in the process: first, to find\nout in a grave manner what we like best; secondly, to put as much of\nthis as we can (which is little enough) into form; thirdly, to put this\nformed abstraction into a proper place.And we have now, therefore, to make these three inquiries in succession:\nfirst, what we like, or what is the right material of ornament; then how\nwe are to present it, or its right treatment; then, where we are to put\nit, or its right place.I think I can answer that first inquiry in this\nChapter, the second inquiry in the next Chapter, and the third I shall\nanswer in a more diffusive manner, by taking up in succession the\nseveral parts of architecture above distinguished, and rapidly noting\nthe kind of ornament fittest for each.XIV., that all noble ornamentation\nwas the expression of man's delight in God's work.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.This implied that\nthere was an _ig_noble ornamentation, which was the expression of man's\ndelight in his _own_.There is such a school, chiefly degraded classic\nand Renaissance, in which the ornament is composed of imitations of\ntilings made by man.I think, before inquiring what we like best of\nGod's work, we had better get rid of all this imitation of man's, and be\nquite sure we do not like _that_.We shall rapidly glance, then, at the material of decoration\nhence derived.And now I cannot, as I before have done respecting\nconstruction, _convince_ the reader of one thing being wrong, and\nanother right.I have confessed as much again and again; I am now only\nto make appeal to him, and cross-question him, whether he really does\nlike things or not.If he likes the ornament on the base of the column\nof the Place Vendome, composed of Wellington boots and laced frock\ncoats, I cannot help it; I can only say I differ from him, and don't\nlike it.And if, therefore, I speak dictatorially, and say this is base,\nor degraded, or ugly, I mean, only that I believe men of the longest\nexperience in the matter would either think it so, or would be prevented\nfrom thinking it so only by some morbid condition of their minds; and I\nbelieve that the reader, if he examine himself candidly, will usually\nagree in my statements.V. The subjects of ornament found in man's work may properly fall\ninto four heads: 1.Instruments of art, agriculture, and war; armor, and\ndress; 2.The custom of raising trophies on pillars, and of dedicating arms in\ntemples, appears to have first suggested the idea of employing them as\nthe subjects of sculptural ornament: thenceforward, this abuse has been\nchiefly characteristic of classical architecture, whether true or\nRenaissance.Armor is a noble thing in its proper service and\nsubordination to the body; so is an animal's hide on its back; but a\nheap of cast skins, or of shed armor, is alike unworthy of all regard or\nimitation.We owe much true sublimity, and more of delightful\npicturesqueness, to the introduction of armor both in painting and\nsculpture: in poetry it is better still,--Homer's undressed Achilles is\nless grand than his crested and shielded Achilles, though Phidias would\nrather have had him naked; in all mediaeval painting, arms, like all\nother parts of costume, are treated with exquisite care and delight; in\nthe designs of Leonardo, Raffaelle, and Perugino, the armor sometimes\nbecomes almost too conspicuous from the rich and endless invention\nbestowed upon it; while Titian and Rubens seek in its flash what the\nMilanese and Perugian sought in its form, sometimes subordinating\nheroism to the light of the steel, while the great designers wearied\nthemselves in its elaborate fancy.But all this labor was given to the living, not the dead armor; to the\nshell with its animal in it, not the cast shell of the beach; and even\nso, it was introduced more sparingly by the good sculptors than the good\npainters; for the former felt, and with justice, that the painter had\nthe power of conquering the over prominence of costume by the expression\nand color of the countenance, and that by the darkness of the eye, and\nglow of the cheek, he could always conquer the gloom and the flash of\nthe mail; but they could hardly, by any boldness or energy of the marble\nfeatures, conquer the forwardness and conspicuousness of the sharp\narmorial forms.Their armed figures were therefore almost always\nsubordinate, their principal figures draped or naked, and their choice\nof subject was much influenced by this feeling of necessity.But the\nRenaissance sculptors displayed the love of a Camilla for the mere crest\nand plume.Paltry and false alike in every feeling of their narrowed\nminds, they attached themselves, not only to costume without the person,\nbut to the pettiest details of the costume itself.They could not\ndescribe Achilles, but they could describe his shield; a shield like\nthose of dedicated spoil, without a handle, never to be waved in the\nface of war.And then we have helmets and lances, banners and swords,\nsometimes with men to hold them, sometimes without; but always chiselled\nwith a tailor-like love of the chasing or the embroidery,--show helmets\nof the stage, no Vulcan work on them, no heavy hammer strokes, no Etna\nfire in the metal of them, nothing but pasteboard crests and high\nfeathers.And these, cast together in disorderly heaps, or grinning\nvacantly over keystones, form one of the leading decorations of\nRenaissance architecture, and that one of the best; for helmets and\nlances, however loosely laid, are better than violins, and pipes, and\nbooks of music, which were another of the Palladian and Sansovinian\nsources of ornament.Supported by ancient authority, the abuse soon\nbecame a matter of pride, and since it was easy to copy a heap of cast\nclothes, but difficult to manage an arranged design of human figures,\nthe indolence of architects came to the aid of their affectation, until\nby the moderns we find the practice carried out to its most interesting\nresults, and, as above noted, a large pair of boots occupying the\nprincipal place in the bas-reliefs on the base of the Colonne Vendome.A less offensive, because singularly grotesque, example of the\nabuse at its height, occurs in the Hotel des Invalides, where the dormer\nwindows are suits of armor down to the bottom of the corselet, crowned\nby the helmet, and with the window in the middle of the breast.Instruments of agriculture and the arts are of less frequent occurrence,\nexcept in hieroglyphics, and other work, where they are not employed as\nornaments, but represented for the sake of accurate knowledge, or as\nsymbols.Wherever they have purpose of this kind, they are of course\nperfectly right; but they are then part of the building's conversation,\nnot conducive to its beauty.The French have managed, with great\ndexterity, the representation of the machinery for the elevation of\ntheir Luxor obelisk, now sculptured on its base.I have already spoken of the error of introducing\ndrapery, as such, for ornament, in the \"Seven Lamps.\"I may here note a\ncurious instance of the abuse in the church of the Jesuiti at Venice\n(Renaissance).On first entering you suppose that the church, being in a\npoor quarter of the city, has been somewhat meanly decorated by heavy\ngreen and white curtains of an ordinary upholsterer's pattern: on\nlooking closer, they are discovered to be of marble, with the green\npattern inlaid.Another remarkable instance is in a piece of not\naltogether unworthy architecture at Paris (Rue Rivoli), where the\ncolumns are supposed to be decorated with images of handkerchiefs tied\nin a stout knot round the middle of them.This shrewd invention bids\nfair to become a new order.Multitudes of massy curtains and various\nupholstery, more or less in imitation of that of the drawing-room, are\ncarved and gilt, in wood or stone, about the altars and other theatrical\nportions of Romanist churches; but from these coarse and senseless\nvulgarities we may well turn, in all haste, to note, with respect as\nwell as regret, one of the errors of the great school of Niccolo\nPisano,--an error so full of feeling as to be sometimes all but\nredeemed, and altogether forgiven,--the sculpture, namely, of curtains\naround the recumbent statues upon tombs, curtains which angels are\nrepresented as withdrawing, to gaze upon the faces of those who are at\nrest.For some time the idea was simply and slightly expressed, and\nthough there was always a painfulness in finding the shafts of stone,\nwhich were felt to be the real supporters of the canopy, represented as\nof yielding drapery, yet the beauty of the angelic figures, and the\ntenderness of the thought, disarmed all animadversion.But the scholars\nof the Pisani, as usual, caricatured when they were unable to invent;\nand the quiet curtained canopy became a huge marble tent, with a pole in\nthe centre of it.Thus vulgarised, the idea itself soon disappeared, to\nmake room for urns, torches, and weepers, and the other modern\nparaphernalia of the churchyard.I have allowed this kind of subject to form a\nseparate head, owing to the importance of rostra in Roman decoration,\nand to the continual occurrence of naval subjects in modern monumental\nbas-relief.Fergusson says, somewhat doubtfully, that he perceives a\n\"_kind_ of beauty\" in a ship: I say, without any manner of doubt, that a\nship is one of the loveliest things man ever made, and one of the\nnoblest; nor do I know any lines, out of divine work, so lovely as those\nof the head of a ship, or even as the sweep of the timbers of a small\nboat, not a race boat, a mere floating chisel, but a broad, strong, sea\nboat, able to breast a wave and break it: and yet, with all this beauty,\nships cannot be made subjects of sculpture.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.No one pauses in particular\ndelight beneath the pediments of the Admiralty; nor does scenery of\nshipping ever become prominent in bas-relief without destroying it:\nwitness the base of the Nelson pillar.It may be, and must be sometimes,\nintroduced in severe subordination to the figure subject, but just\nenough to indicate the scene; sketched in the lightest lines on the\nbackground; never with any attempt at realisation, never with any\nequality to the force of the figures, unless the whole purpose of the\nsubject be picturesque.I shall explain this exception presently, in\nspeaking of imitative architecture.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.There is one piece of a ship's fittings, however, which may\nbe thought to have obtained acceptance as a constant element of\narchitectural ornament,--the cable: it is not, however, the cable\nitself, but its abstract form, a group of twisted lines (which a cable\nonly exhibits in common with many natural objects), which is indeed\nbeautiful as an ornament.Make the resemblance complete, give to the\nstone the threads and character of the cable, and you may, perhaps,\nregard the sculpture with curiosity, but never more with admiration.Consider the effect of the base of the statue of King William IV.The erroneous use of armor, or dress, or\ninstruments, or shipping, as decorative subject, is almost exclusively\nconfined to bad architecture--Roman or Renaissance.But the false use of\narchitecture itself, as an ornament of architecture, is conspicuous even\nin the mediaeval work of the best times, and is a grievous fault in some\nof its noblest examples.It is, therefore, of great importance to note exactly at what point this\nabuse begins, and in what it consists.In all bas-relief, architecture may be introduced as an\nexplanation of the scene in which the figures act; but with more or less\nprominence in the _inverse ratio of the importance of the figures_.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.The metaphysical reason of this is, that where the figures are of great\nvalue and beauty, the mind is supposed to be engaged wholly with them;\nand it is an impertinence to disturb its contemplation of them by any\nminor features whatever.As the figures become of less value, and are\nregarded with less intensity, accessory subjects may be introduced, such\nas the thoughts may have leisure for.Thus, if the figures be as large as life, and complete statues, it is\ngross vulgarity to carve a temple above them, or distribute them over\nsculptured rocks, or lead them up steps into pyramids: I need hardly\ninstance Canova's works,[63] and the Dutch pulpit groups, with\nfishermen, boats, and nets, in the midst of church naves.If the figures be in bas-relief, though as large as life, the scene may\nbe explained by lightly traced outlines: this is admirably done in the\nNinevite marbles.If the figures be in bas-relief, or even alto-relievo, but less than\nlife, and if their purpose is rather to enrich a space and produce\npicturesque shadows, than to draw the thoughts entirely to themselves,\nthe scenery in which they act may become prominent.The most exquisite\nexamples of this treatment are the gates of Ghiberti.What would that\nMadonna of the Annunciation be, without the little shrine into which she\nshrinks back?But all mediaeval work is full of delightful examples of\nthe same kind of treatment: the gates of hell and of paradise are\nimportant pieces, both of explanation and effect, in all early\nrepresentations of the last judgment, or of the descent into Hades.Peter, and the crushing flat of the devil under his own\ndoor, when it is beaten in, would hardly be understood without the\nrespective gate-ways above.The best of all the later capitals of the\nDucal Palace of Venice depends for great part of its value on the\nrichness of a small campanile, which is pointed to proudly by a small\nemperor in a turned-up hat, who, the legend informs us, is \"Numa\nPompilio, imperador, edifichador di tempi e chiese.\"Shipping may be introduced, or rich fancy of vestments, crowns,\nand ornaments, exactly on the same conditions as architecture; and if\nthe reader will look back to my definition of the picturesque in the\n\"Seven Lamps,\" he will see why I said, above, that they might only be\nprominent when the purpose of the subject was partly picturesque; that\nis to say, when the mind is intended to derive part of its enjoyment\nfrom the parasitical qualities and accidents of the thing, not from the\nheart of the thing itself.And thus, while we must regret the flapping sails in the death of Nelson\nin Trafalgar Square, we may yet most heartily enjoy the sculpture of a\nstorm in one of the bas-reliefs of the tomb of St.Pietro Martire in the\nchurch of St.Eustorgio at Milan, where the grouping of the figures is\nmost fancifully complicated by the undercut cordage of the vessel.In all these instances, however, observe that the permission\nto represent the human work as an ornament, is conditional on its being\nnecessary to the representation of a scene, or explanation of an action.On no terms whatever could any such subject be independently admissible.Observe, therefore, the use of manufacture as ornament is--\n\n  1.With heroic figure sculpture, not admissible at all.With picturesque figure sculpture, admissible in the degree of its\n       picturesqueness.Without figure sculpture, not admissible at all.So also in painting: Michael Angelo, in the Sistine Chapel, would not\nhave willingly painted a dress of figured damask or of watered satin;\nhis was heroic painting, not admitting accessories.Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and Vandyck, would be very sorry to\npart with their figured stuffs and lustrous silks; and sorry, observe,\nexactly in the degree of their picturesque feeling.Should not _we_ also\nbe sorry to have Bishop Ambrose without his vest, in that picture of the\nNational Gallery?But I think Vandyck would not have liked, on the other hand, the vest\nwithout the bishop.I much doubt if Titian or Veronese would have\nenjoyed going into Waterloo House, and making studies of dresses upon\nthe counter.So, therefore, finally, neither architecture nor any other human\nwork is admissible as an ornament, except in subordination to figure\nsubject.And this law is grossly and painfully violated by those curious\nexamples of Gothic, both early and late, in the north, (but late, I\nthink, exclusively, in Italy,) in which the minor features of the\narchitecture were composed of _small models_ of the larger: examples\nwhich led the way to a series of abuses materially affecting the life,\nstrength, and nobleness of the Northern Gothic,--abuses which no\nNinevite, nor Egyptian, nor Greek, nor Byzantine, nor Italian of the\nearlier ages would have endured for an instant, and which strike me with\nrenewed surprise whenever I pass beneath a portal of thirteenth century\nNorthern Gothic, associated as they are with manifestations of exquisite\nfeeling and power in other directions.The porches of Bourges, Amiens,\nNotre Dame of Paris, and Notre Dame of Dijon, may be noted as\nconspicuous in error: small models of feudal towers with diminutive\nwindows and battlements, of cathedral spires with scaly pinnacles, mixed\nwith temple pediments and nondescript edifices of every kind, are\ncrowded together over the recess of the niche into a confused fool's cap\nfor the saint below.Italian Gothic is almost entirely free from the\ntaint of this barbarism until the Renaissance period, when it becomes\nrampant in the cathedral of Como and Certosa of Pavia; and at Venice we\nfind the Renaissance churches decorated with models of fortifications\nlike those in the Repository at Woolwich, or inlaid with mock arcades in\npseudo-perspective, copied from garden", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "I conclude, then, with the reader's leave, that all ornament\nis base which takes for its subject human work, that it is utterly\nbase,--painful to every rightly-toned mind, without perhaps immediate\nsense of the reason, but for a reason palpable enough when we _do_ think\nof it.For to carve our own work, and set it up for admiration, is a\nmiserable self-complacency, a contentment in our own wretched doings,\nwhen we might have been looking at God's doings.And all noble ornament\nis the exact reverse of this.It is the expression of man's delight in\nGod's work.For observe, the function of ornament is to make you happy.Not in thinking of what you have done\nyourself; not in your own pride, not your own birth; not in your own\nbeing, or your own will, but in looking at God; watching what He does,\nwhat He is; and obeying His law, and yielding yourself to His will.You are to be made happy by ornaments; therefore they must be the\nexpression of all this.Not copies of your own handiwork; not boastings\nof your own grandeur; not heraldries; not king's arms, nor any\ncreature's arms, but God's arm, seen in His work.Not manifestation of\nyour delight in your own laws, or your own liberties, or your own\ninventions; but in divine laws, constant, daily, common laws;--not\nComposite laws, nor Doric laws, nor laws of the five orders, but of the\nTen Commandments.Then the proper material of ornament will be whatever God has\ncreated; and its proper treatment, that which seems in accordance with\nor symbolical of His laws.And, for material, we shall therefore have,\nfirst, the abstract lines which are most frequent in nature; and then,\nfrom lower to higher, the whole range of systematised inorganic and\norganic forms.We shall rapidly glance in order at their kinds; and,\nhowever absurd the elemental division of inorganic matter by the\nancients may seem to the modern chemist, it is one so grand and simple\nfor arrangements of external appearances, that I shall here follow it;\nnoticing first, after abstract lines, the imitable forms of the four\nelements, of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, and then those of animal\norganisms.It may be convenient to the reader to have the order stated\nin a clear succession at first, thus:--\n\n   1.It may be objected that clouds are a form of moisture, not of air.They\nare, however, a perfect expression of aerial states and currents, and\nmay sufficiently well stand for the element they move in.And I have put\nvegetation apparently somewhat out of its place, owing to its vast\nimportance as a means of decoration, and its constant association with\nbirds and men.I have not with lines named also shades\nand colors, for this evident reason, that there are no such things as\nabstract shadows, irrespective of the forms which exhibit them, and\ndistinguished in their own nature from each other; and that the\narrangement of shadows, in greater or less quantity, or in certain\nharmonical successions, is an affair of treatment, not of selection.And\nwhen we use abstract colors, we are in fact using a part of nature\nherself,--using a quality of her light, correspondent with that of the\nair, to carry sound; and the arrangement of color in harmonious masses\nis again a matter of treatment, not selection.Yet even in this separate\nart of coloring, as referred to architecture, it is very notable that\nthe best tints are always those of natural stones.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.These can hardly be\nwrong; I think I never yet saw an offensive introduction of the natural\ncolors of marble and precious stones, unless in small mosaics, and in\none or two glaring instances of the resolute determination to produce\nsomething ugly at any cost.On the other hand, I have most assuredly\nnever yet seen a painted building, ancient or modern, which seemed to me\nquite right.Our first constituents of ornament will therefore be abstract\nlines, that is to say, the most frequent contours of natural objects,\ntransferred to architectural forms when it is not right or possible to\nrender such forms distinctly imitative.For instance, the line or curve\nof the edge of a leaf may be accurately given to the edge of a stone,\nwithout rendering the stone in the least _like_ a leaf, or suggestive of\na leaf; and this the more fully, because the lines of nature are alike\nin all her works; simpler or richer in combination, but the same in\ncharacter; and when they are taken out of their combinations it is\nimpossible to say from which of her works they have been borrowed, their\nuniversal property being that of ever-varying curvature in the most\nsubtle and subdued transitions, with peculiar expressions of motion,\nelasticity, or dependence, which I have already insisted upon at some\nlength in the chapters on typical beauty in \"Modern Painters.\"But, that\nthe reader may here be able to compare them for himself as deduced from\ndifferent sources, I have drawn, as accurately as I can, on the opposite\nplate, some ten or eleven lines from natural forms of very different\nsubstances and scale: the first, _a b_, is in the original, I think, the\nmost beautiful simple curve I have ever seen in my life; it is a curve\nabout three quarters of a mile long, formed by the surface of a small\nglacier of the second order, on a spur of the Aiguille de Blaitiere\n(Chamouni).I have merely outlined the crags on the right of it, to show\ntheir sympathy and united action with the curve of the glacier, which is\nof course entirely dependent on their opposition to its descent;\nsoftened, however, into unity by the snow, which rarely melts on this\nhigh glacier surface.The line _d c_ is some mile and a half or two miles long; it is part of\nthe flank of the chain of the Dent d'Oche above the lake of Geneva, one\nor two of the lines of the higher and more distant ranges being given in\ncombination with it._h_ is a line about four feet long, a branch of spruce fir.I have taken\nthis tree because it is commonly supposed to be stiff and ungraceful;\nits outer sprays are, however, more noble in their sweep than almost any\nthat I know: but this fragment is seen at great disadvantage, because\nplaced upside down, in order that the reader may compare its curvatures\nwith _c d_, _e g_, and _i k_, which are all mountain lines; _e g_, about\nfive hundred feet of the southern edge of the Matterhorn; _i k_, the\nentire <DW72> of the Aiguille Bouchard, from its summit into the valley\nof Chamouni, a line some three miles long; _l m_ is the line of the side\nof a willow leaf traced by laying the leaf on the paper; _n o_, one of\nthe innumerable groups of curves at the lip of a paper Nautilus; _p_, a\nspiral, traced on the paper round a Serpula; _q r_, the leaf of the\nAlisma Plantago with its interior ribs, real size; _s t_, the side of a\nbay-leaf; _u w_, of a salvia leaf; and it is to be carefully noted that\nthese last curves, being never intended by nature to be seen singly, are\nmore heavy and less agreeable than any of the others which would be seen\nas independent lines.But all agree in their character of changeful\ncurvature, the mountain and glacier lines only excelling the rest in\ndelicacy and richness of transition.Why lines of this kind are beautiful, I endeavored to show in\nthe \"Modern Painters;\" but one point, there omitted, may be mentioned\nhere,--that almost all these lines are expressive of action of _force_\nof some kind, while the circle is a line of limitation or support.In\nleafage they mark the forces of its growth and expansion, but some among\nthe most beautiful of them are described by bodies variously in motion,\nor subjected to force; as by projectiles in the air, by the particles of\nwater in a gentle current, by planets in motion in an orbit, by their\nsatellites, if the actual path of the satellite in space be considered\ninstead of its relation to the planet; by boats, or birds, turning in\nthe water or air, by clouds in various action upon the wind, by sails in\nthe curvatures they assume under its force, and by thousands of other\nobjects moving or bearing force.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.In the Alisma leaf, _q r_, the lines\nthrough its body, which are of peculiar beauty, mark the different\nexpansions of its fibres, and are, I think, exactly the same as those\nwhich would be traced by the currents of a river entering a lake of the\nshape of the leaf, at the end where the stalk is, and passing out at its\npoint.Circular curves, on the contrary, are always, I think, curves of\nlimitation or support; that is to say, curves of perfect rest.The\ncylindrical curve round the stem of a plant binds its fibres together;\nwhile the _ascent_ of the stem is in lines of various curvature: so the\ncurve of the horizon and of the apparent heaven, of the rainbow, etc.:\nand though the reader might imagine that the circular orbit of any\nmoving body, or the curve described by a sling, was a curve of motion,\nhe should observe that the circular character is given to the curve not\nby the motion, but by the confinement: the circle is the consequence not\nof the energy of the body, but of its being forbidden to leave the\ncentre; and whenever the whirling or circular motion can be fully\nimpressed on it we obtain instant balance and rest with respect to the\ncentre of the circle.Hence the peculiar fitness of the circular curve as a sign of rest, and\nsecurity of support, in arches; while the other curves, belonging\nespecially to action, are to be used in the more active architectural\nfeatures--the hand and foot (the capital and base), and in all minor\nornaments; more freely in proportion to their independence of structural\nconditions.We need not, however, hope to be able to imitate, in general\nwork, any of the subtly combined curvatures of nature's highest\ndesigning: on the contrary, their extreme refinement renders them unfit\nfor coarse service or material.Lines which are lovely in the pearly\nfilm of the Nautilus shell, are lost in the grey roughness of stone; and\nthose which are sublime in the blue of far away hills, are weak in the\nsubstance of incumbent marble.Of all the graceful lines assembled on\nPlate VII., we shall do well to be content with two of the simplest.We\nshall take one mountain line (_e g_) and one leaf line (_u w_), or\nrather fragments of them, for we shall perhaps not want them all.I will\nmark off from _u w_ the little bit _x y_, and from _e g_ the piece _e\nf_; both which appear to me likely to be serviceable: and if hereafter\nwe need the help of any abstract lines, we will see what we can do with\nthese only.It may be asked why I do not\nsay rocks or mountains?Simply, because the nobility of these depends,\nfirst, on their scale, and, secondly, on accident.Their scale cannot be\nrepresented, nor their accident systematised.No sculptor can in the\nleast imitate the peculiar character of accidental fracture: he can obey\nor exhibit the laws of nature, but he cannot copy the felicity of her\nfancies, nor follow the steps of her fury.The very glory of a mountain\nis in the revolutions which raised it into power, and the forces which\nare striking it into ruin.But we want no cold and careful imitation of\ncatastrophe; no calculated mockery of convulsion; no delicate\nrecommendation of ruin.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.We are to follow the labor of Nature, but not\nher disturbance; to imitate what she has deliberately ordained,[64] not\nwhat she has violently suffered, or strangely permitted.The only uses,\ntherefore, of rock form which are wise in the architect, are its actual\nintroduction (by leaving untouched such blocks as are meant for rough\nservice), and that noble use of the general examples of mountain\nstructure of which I have often heretofore spoken.Imitations of rock\nform have, for the most part, been confined to periods of degraded\nfeeling and to architectural toys or pieces of dramatic effect,--the\nCalvaries and holy sepulchres of Romanism, or the grottoes and fountains\nof English gardens.They were, however, not unfrequent in mediaeval\nbas-reliefs; very curiously and elaborately treated by Ghiberti on the\ndoors of Florence, and in religious sculpture necessarily introduced\nwherever the life of the anchorite was to be expressed.They were rarely\nintroduced as of ornamental character, but for particular service and\nexpression; we shall see an interesting example in the Ducal Palace at\nVenice.But against crystalline form, which is the completely\nsystematised natural structure of the earth, none of these objections\nhold good, and, accordingly, it is an endless element of decoration,\nwhere higher conditions of structure cannot be represented.The\nfour-sided pyramid, perhaps the most frequent of all natural crystals,\nis called in architecture a dogtooth; its use is quite limitless, and\nalways beautiful: the cube and rhomb are almost equally frequent in\nchequers and dentils: and all mouldings of the middle Gothic are little\nmore than representations of the canaliculated crystals of the beryl,\nand such other minerals:\n\nSec.I do not suppose a single hint was ever actually\ntaken from mineral form; not even by the Arabs in their stalactite\npendants and vaults: all that I mean to allege is, that beautiful\nornament, wherever found, or however invented, is always either an\nintentional or unintentional copy of some constant natural form; and\nthat in this particular instance, the pleasure we have in these\ngeometrical figures of our own invention, is dependent for all its\nacuteness on the natural tendency impressed on us by our Creator to love\nthe forms into which the earth He gave us to tread, and out of which He\nformed our bodies, knit itself as it was separated from the deep.The reasons which prevent rocks from being used for ornament repress\nstill more forcibly the portraiture of the sea.Yet the constant\nnecessity of introducing some representation of water in order to\nexplain the scene of events, or as a sacred symbol, has forced the\nsculptors of all ages to the invention of some type or letter for it, if\nnot an actual imitation.We find every degree of conventionalism or of\nnaturalism in these types, the earlier being, for the most part,\nthoughtful symbols; the latter, awkward attempts at portraiture.[65] The\nmost conventional of all types is the Egyptian zigzag, preserved in the\nastronomical sign of Aquarius; but every nation, with any capacities of\nthought, has given, in some of its work, the same great definition of\nopen water, as \"an undulatory thing with fish in it.\"I say _open_\nwater, because inland nations have a totally different conception of the\nelement.Imagine for an instant the different feelings of an husbandman\nwhose hut is built by the Rhine or the Po, and who sees, day by day,\nthe same giddy succession of silent power, the same opaque, thick,\nwhirling, irresistible labyrinth of rushing lines and twisted eddies,\ncoiling themselves into serpentine race by the reedy banks, in omne\nvolubilis aevum,--and the image of the sea in the mind of the fisher upon\nthe rocks of Ithaca, or by the Straits of Sicily, who sees how, day by\nday, the morning winds come coursing to the shore, every breath of them\nwith a green wave rearing before it; clear, crisp, ringing, merry-minded\nwaves, that fall over and over each other, laughing like children as\nthey near the beach, and at last clash themselves all into dust of\ncrystal over the dazzling sweeps of sand.Fancy the difference of the\nimage of water in those two minds, and then compare the sculpture of the\ncoiling eddies of the Tigris and its reedy branches in those slabs of\nNineveh, with the crested curls of the Greek sea on the coins of\nCamerina or Tarentum.But both agree in the undulatory lines, either of\nthe currents or the surface, and in the introduction of fish as\nexplanatory of the meaning of those lines (so also the Egyptians in\ntheir frescoes, with most elaborate realisation of the fish).There is a\nvery curious instance on a Greek mirror in the British Museum,\nrepresenting Orion on the Sea; and multitudes of examples with dolphins\non the Greek vases: the type is preserved without alteration in mediaeval\npainting and sculpture.The sea in that Greek mirror (at least 400\nB.C.), in the mosaics of Torcello and St.Frediano at Lucca, on the gate of the fortress of St.Michael's Mount in\nNormandy, on the Bayeux tapestry, and on the capitals of the Ducal\nPalace at Venice (under Arion on his Dolphin), is represented in a\nmanner absolutely identical.Giotto, in the frescoes of Avignon, has,\nwith his usual strong feeling for naturalism, given the best example I\nremember, in painting, of the unity of the conventional system with\ndirect imitation, and that both in sea and river; giving in pure blue\ncolor the coiling whirlpool of the stream, and the curled crest of the\nbreaker.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.But in all early sculptural examples, both imitation and\ndecorative effect are subordinate to easily understood symbolical\nlanguage; the undulatory lines are often valuable as an enrichment of\nsurface, but are rarely of any studied gracefulness.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.One of the best\nexamples I know of their expressive arrangement is around some figures\nin a spandril at Bourges, representing figures sinking in deep sea (the\ndeluge): the waved lines yield beneath the bodies and wildly lave the\nedge of the moulding, two birds, as if to mark the reverse of all order\nof nature, lowest of all sunk in the depth of them.In later times of\ndebasement, water began to be represented with its waves, foam, etc., as\non the Vendramin tomb at Venice, above cited; but even there, without\nany definite ornamental purpose, the sculptor meant partly to explain a\nstory, partly to display dexterity of chiselling, but not to produce\nbeautiful forms pleasant to the eye.The imitation is vapid and joyless,\nand it has often been matter of surprise to me that sculptors, so fond\nof exhibiting their skill, should have suffered this imitation to fall\nso short, and remain so cold,--should not have taken more pains to curl\nthe waves clearly, to edge them sharply, and to express, by drill-holes\nor other artifices, the character of foam.I think in one of the Antwerp\nchurches something of this kind is done in wood, but in general it is\nrare.If neither the sea nor\nthe rock can be imagined, still less the devouring fire.It has been\nsymbolised by radiation both in painting and sculpture, for the most\npart in the latter very unsuccessfully.It was suggested to me, not long\nago,[66] that zigzag decorations of Norman architects were typical of\nlight springing from the half-set orb of the sun; the resemblance to the\nordinary sun type is indeed remarkable, but I believe accidental.I\nshall give you, in my large plates, two curious instances of radiation\nin brick ornament above arches, but I think these also without any very\nluminous intention.The imitations of fire in the torches of Cupids and\ngenii, and burning in tops of urns, which attest and represent the\nmephitic inspirations of the seventeenth century in most London\nchurches, and in monuments all over civilised Europe, together with the\ngilded rays of Romanist altars, may be left to such mercy as the reader\nis inclined to show them.Hardly more manageable than flames,\nand of no ornamental use, their majesty being in scale and color, and\ninimitable in marble.They are lightly traced in much of the cinque\ncento sculpture; very boldly and grandly in the strange Last Judgment in\nthe porch of St.Maclou at Rouen, described in the \"Seven Lamps.\"But\nthe most elaborate imitations are altogether of recent date, arranged in\nconcretions like flattened sacks, forty or fifty feet above the altars\nof continental churches, mixed with the gilded truncheons intended for\nsunbeams above alluded to.I place these lowest in the scale (after inorganic\nforms) as being moulds or coats of organism; not themselves organic.The\nsense of this, and of their being mere emptiness and deserted houses,\nmust always prevent them, however beautiful in their lines, from being\nlargely used in ornamentation.It is better to take the line and leave\nthe shell.One form, indeed, that of the cockle, has been in all ages\nused as the decoration of half domes, which were named conchas from\ntheir shell form: and I believe the wrinkled lip of the cockle, so used,\nto have been the origin, in some parts of Europe at least, of the\nexuberant foliation of the round arch.The scallop also is a pretty\nradiant form, and mingles well with other symbols when it is needed.The\ncrab is always as delightful as a grotesque, for here we suppose the\nbeast inside the shell; and he sustains his part in a lively manner\namong the other signs of the zodiac, with the scorpion; or scattered\nupon sculptured shores, as beside the Bronze Boar of Florence.We shall\nfind him in a basket at Venice, at the base of one of the Piazzetta\nshafts.These, as beautiful in their forms as they are\nfamiliar to our sight, while their interest is increased by their\nsymbolic meaning, are of great value as material of ornament.Love of\nthe picturesque has generally induced a choice of some supple form with\nscaly body and lashing tail, but the simplest fish form is largely\nemployed in mediaeval work.We shall find the plain oval body and sharp\nhead of the Thunny constantly at Venice; and the fish used in the\nexpression of sea-water, or water generally, are always plain bodied\ncreatures in the best mediaeval sculpture.The Greek type of the dolphin,\nhowever, sometimes but slightly exaggerated from the real outline of the\nDelphinus Delphis,[67] is one of the most picturesque of animal forms;\nand the action of its slow revolving plunge is admirably caught upon the\nsurface sea represented in Greek vases.little did he know the torture he was giving\nme--spread before me on the table more than a dozen orders for places of\namusement,--to me, uninitiated, places of exceeding great joy--red\norders, green orders, orange and blue orders, orders for concerts,\norders for gardens, orders for theatres royal, and orders for the opera.Oh, reader, fancy at that moment my state of mind;

I\nhad, in fact, with imaginary surgical instruments, cut myself all into\nlittle pieces, dissected my every nerve, filled all my arteries with red\nwax and my veins with blue, traced out the origin and insertion of every\nmuscle, and thought of what each one could and what each one could not\ndo;

so being\n\"canny\" and a Scot, I adopted a middle course, and commenced to wipe\nimaginary perspiration from my brow, an operation which, of course,\nnecessitated the removal of my head-dress.Probably the cambric\nhandkerchief caught the tail of the eye of a quieter-looking knight of\nthe quill, who sat a little apart from the other drones of the pen; at\nany rate he quickly dismounted, and coming up to me politely asked my\nbusiness.I told him, and he civilly motioned me to a seat to await my\nturn for examination.By-and-bye other candidates dropped in, each of\nwhom I rejoiced to observe looked a little paler, decidedly more blue,\nand infinitely greener than I did myself!This was some relief, so I\nsat by the dusty window which overlooked the Thames, watching the little\nskiffs gliding to and fro, the boats hastening hither and thither, and\nthe big lazy-like barges that floated on the calm unruffled bosom of the\ngreat mysterious river, and thinking and wishing that it could but break\nits everlasting silence and tell its tale, and mention even a tithe of\nthe scenes that had been acted on its breast or by its banks since it\nfirst rolled its infant waters to the sea, through a forest of trees\ninstead of a forest of masts and spires, or tell of the many beings that\nhad sought relief from a world of sin and suffering under its dark\ncurrent.So ran my thoughts, and as the river so did time glide by, and\ntwo hours passed away, then a third; and when at last my name was\ncalled, it was only to inform me that I must come back on the following\nday, there being too many to be examined at once.At the hour appointed I was immediately conducted into the presence of\nthe august assembly of examiners, and this, is what I saw, or rather,\nthis was the picture on my retina, for to see, in the usual acceptation\nof the term, was, under the circumstances, out of the question:--A table\nwith a green cover, laid out for a feast--to me a ghastly feast--of\nreason and flow of soul.My reason was to form the feast, my soul was\nto flow; the five pleasant-looking and gentlemanly men who sat around\nwere to partake of the banquet.I did not walk into the room, I seemed\nto glide as if in a dream, or as if I had been my own ghost.Every\nperson and every thing in the room appeared strangely contorted; and the\nwhole formed a wonderful mirage, miraculously confused.The fire hopped\nup on the table, the table consigned itself to the flames at one moment,\nand made an insane attempt to get up the chimney the next.The roof\nbending down in one corner affectionately kissed the carpet, the carpet\nbobbing up at another returned the chaste salute.Then the gentlemen\nsmiled on me pleasantly, while I replied by a horrible grin.\"Sit down, sir,\" said one, and his voice sounded far away, as if in\nanother world, as I tottered to the chair, and with palsied arm helped\nmyself to a glass of water, which had been placed on the table for my\nuse.The water revived me, and at the first task I was asked to\nperform--translate a small portion of Gregory's (not powder) Conspectus\ninto English--my senses came back.The scales fell from my eyes, the\ntable and fire resumed their proper places, the roof and carpet ceased\nto dally, my scattered brains came all of a heap once more, and I was\nmyself again as much as ever Richard was, or any other man.I answered\nmost of the questions, if not all.I was tackled for ten minutes at a\ntime by each of the examiners.I performed mental operations on the\nlimbs of beings who never existed, prescribed hypothetically for\ninnumerable ailments, brought divers mythical children into the world,\ndissected muscles and nerves in imagination, talked of green trees,\nfruit, flowers, natural families, and far-away lands, as if I had been\nLinnaeus, Columbus, and Humboldt all in one, so that, in less than an\nhour, the august body leant their backs against their respective chairs,\nand looked knowingly in each other's faces for a period of several very\nlong seconds.They then nodded to one another, did this august body,\nlooked at their tablets, and nodded again.After this pantomime had\ncome to a conclusion I was furnished with a sheet of foolscap and sent\nback to the room above the Thames to write a dissertation on fractures\nof the cranium, and shortly after sending it in I was recalled and\ninformed that I had sustained the dread ordeal to their entire\nsatisfaction, etc, and that I had better, before I left the house, pay\nan official visit to the Director-General.I bowed, retired, heaved a\nmonster sigh, made the visit of ceremony, and afterwards my exit.I met on coming out was a short, middle-aged\nShylock, hook-nosed and raven-haired, and arrayed in a surtout of seedy\nblack.He approached me with much bowing and smiling, and holding below\nmy nose a little green tract which he begged I would accept.\"Exceedingly kind,\" thought I, and was about to comply with his request,\nwhen, greatly to my surprise and the discomposure of my toilet, an arm\nwas hooked into mine, I was wheeled round as if on a pivot, and found\nmyself face to face with another Israelite armed with a _red_ tract.\"He is a Jew and a dog,\" said this latter, shaking a forefinger close to\nmy face.said I.  The words had hardly escaped my lips when the other\nJew whipped his arm through mine and quickly re-wheeled me towards him.\"He is a liar and a cheat,\" hissed he, with the same motion of the\nforefinger as his rival had used.said I, beginning to wonder what it all meant.I had not,\nhowever, long time to wonder, being once more set spinning by the\nIsraelite of the red tract.he whispered, pointing to the other; and the\nconversation was continued in the following strain.Although in the\ncommon sense of the word it really was no conversation, as each of them\naddressed himself to me only, and I could find no reply, still, taking\nthe word in its literal meaning (from con, together, and _verto_, I\nturn), it was indeed a conversation, for they turned me together, each\none, as he addressed me, hooking his arm in mine and whirling me round\nlike the handle of an air-pump or a badly constructed teetotum, and\nshaking a forefinger in my face, as if I were a parrot and he wanted me\nto swear._Shylock of the green tract_.--\"He is a swine and a scoundrel.\"_Israelite of the red_.--\"He's a liar and a thief.\"_Shylock of the green_.--\"And he'll get round you some way.\"_Israelite of red_.--\"Ahab and brothers cheat everybody they can.\"_Shylock of green_.--\"He'll be lending you money.\"_Red_.--\"Whole town know them--\"\n\n_Green_.--\"Charge you thirty per cent.\"Red--\"They are swindlers and dogs.\"_Green_.--\"Look at our estimate.\"_Red_.--\"Look at _our_ estimate.\"_Green_.--\"Peep at our charges.\"_Green_.--\"Come with us, sir,\" tugging me to the right._Red_.--\"This way, master,\" pulling me to the left._Green_.--\"Be advised; he'll rob you.\"_Red_.--\"If you go he'll murder you.\"I roared; and letting fly both fists at the same time,\nI turned them both together on their backs and thus put an end to the\nconversation.Only just in time, though, for the remaining ten tribes,\nor their representatives, were hurrying towards me, each one swaying\naloft a gaudy- tract; and I saw no way of escaping but by fairly\nmaking a run for it, which I accordingly did, pursued by the ten tribes;\nand even had I been a centipede, I would have assuredly been torn limb\nfrom limb, had I not just then rushed into the arms of my feline friend\nfrom Bond Street.He purred, gave me a paw and many congratulations; was so glad I had\npassed,--but, to be sure, knew I would,--and so happy I had escaped the\nJews; would I take a glass of beer?I said, \"I didn't mind;\" so we adjourned (the right word in the right\nplace--adjourned) to a quiet adjoining hotel.\"Now,\" said he, as he tendered the waiter a five-pound Bank of England\nnote, \"you must not take it amiss, Doctor, but--\"\n\n\"No smaller change, sir?\"), opening and turning over the contents\nof a well-lined pocket-book, \"I've only got five--oh, here are sovs, he!Then turning to me: \"I was going to observe,\" he continued, \"that\nif you want a pound or two, he!he!--you know young fellows will be\nyoung fellows--only don't say a word to my father, he!Well, we will go and see\nfather!\"\"But,\" said I, \"I really must go home first.\"\"Oh dear no; don't think of such a thing.\"\"My dear sir, excuse me, but it is just our dinner hour; nice roast\nturkey, and boiled leg of mutton with--\"\n\n\"Any pickled pork?\"now you young _officers_ will have your jokes; but, he!though we don't just eat pork, you'll find us just as good as most\nChristians.Some capital wine--very old brand; father got it from the\nCape only the other day; in fact, though I should not mention these\nthings, it was sent us by a grateful customer.But come, you're hungry,\nwe'll get a cab.\"FIND OUT WHAT A \"GIG\"\nMEANS.The fortnight immediately subsequent to my passing into the Royal Navy\nwas spent by me in the great metropolis, in a perfect maze of pleasure\nand excitement.For the first time for years I knew what it was to be\nfree from care and trouble, independent, and quietly happy.I went the\nround of the sights and the round of the theatres, and lingered\nentranced in the opera; but I went all alone, and unaccompanied, save by\na small pocket guide-book, and I believe I enjoyed it all the more on\nthat account.No one cared for nor looked at the lonely stranger, and\nhe at no one.I roamed through the spacious streets, strolled\ndelightedly in the handsome parks, lounged in picture galleries, or\nburied myself for hour's in the solemn halls and classical courts of\nthat prince of public buildings the British Museum; and, when tired of\nrambling, I dined by myself in a quiet hotel.Every sight was strange\nto me, every sound was new; it was as if some good fairy, by a touch of\nher magic wand, had transported me to an enchanted city; and when I\nclosed my eyes at night, or even shut them by day, behold, there was the\nsame moving panorama that I might gaze on till tired or asleep.But all this was too good to last long.One morning, on coming down to\nbreakfast, bright-hearted and beaming as ever, I found on my plate,\ninstead of fried soles, a long blue official letter, \"On her Majesty's\nService.\"It was my appointment to the `Victory,'--\"additional for\nservice at Haslar Hospital.\"As soon as I read it the enchantment was\ndissolved, the spell was broken; and when I tried that day to find new\npleasures, new sources of amusement, I utterly failed, and found with\ndisgust that it was but a common work-a-day world after all, and that\nLondon was very like other places in that respect.I lingered but a few\nmore days in town, and then hastened by train to Portsmouth to take up\nmy appointment--to join the service in reality.It was a cold raw morning, with a grey and cheerless sky, and a biting\nsouth-wester blowing up channel, and ruffling the water in the Solent.Alongside of the pier the boats and wherries were all in motion,\nscratching and otherwise damaging their gunwales against the stones, as\nthey were lifted up and down at the pleasure of the wavelets.The\nboatmen themselves were either drinking beer at adjacent bars, or\nstamping up and down the quay with the hopes of enticing a little warmth\nto their half-frozen toes, and rubbing the ends of their noses for a\nlike purpose.Suddenly there arose a great commotion among them, and\nthey all rushed off to surround a gentleman in brand-new naval uniform,\nwho was looking, with his mouth open, for a boat, in every place where a\nboat was most unlikely to be.Knowing at a glance that he was a\nstranger, they very generously, each and all of them, offered their\nservices, and wanted to row him somewhere--anywhere.After a great deal\nof fighting and scrambling among themselves, during which the officer\ngot tugged here and tugged there a good many times, he was at last\nbundled into a very dirty cobble, into which a rough-looking boatman\nbounded after him and at once shoved off.The naval officer was myself--the reader's obsequious slave.As for the\nboatman, one thing must be said in his favour, he seemed to be a person\nof religious character--in one thing at least, for, on the Day of\nJudgment, I, for one, will not be able to turn round and say to him \"I\nwas a stranger and ye took me not in,\" for he did take me in.In fact,\nPortsmouth, as a town, is rather particular on this point of\nChristianity: they do take strangers in.asked the jolly waterman, leaning a moment on his oars.\"Be going for to join, I dessay, sir?\"\"You are right,\" said I; \"but have the goodness to pull so that I may\nnot be wet through on both sides.\"\"I'll pay here,\" said I, \"before we go alongside.\"\"That's all, sir--distance is short you know.\"\"Do you mean to say,\" said I, \"that you really mean to charge--\"\n\n\"Just three bob,\" interrupting me; \"flag's up--can see for yourself,\nsir.\"\"The flag, you see--I mean my good man--don't tell me about a flag, I'm\ntoo far north for you;\" and I tried to look as northish as possible.\"Why, sir,\" said the man of oars, with a pitying expression of\ncountenance and voice, \"flag means double fare--anybody'll tell you\nthat, sir.\"said I; \"don't tell me that any one takes the trouble of\nhoisting a flag in order to fill your confounded pockets; there is half\na crown, and not a penny more do you get from me.\"\"Well, sir, o' condition you has me again, sir, you know, sir,--and my\nname's McDonald;\" and he pocketed the money, which I afterwards\ndiscovered was a _leetle_ too much.\"McDonald,\" thought I--\"my\ngrandmother's name; the rascal thinks to come round me by calling\nhimself a Scotchman--the idea of a McDonald being a waterman!\"\"Sir,\" said I, aloud, \"it is my unbiassed opinion and firm conviction\nthat you are--\" I was going to add \"a most unmitigated blackguard,\" but\nI noticed that he was a man of six feet two, with breadth in proportion,\nso I left the sentence unfinished.We were now within sight of the bristling sides of the old `Victory,' on\nthe quarter-deck of which fell the great and gallant Nelson in the hour\nof battle and triumph; and I was a young officer about to join that\nservice which can boast of so many brave and noble men, and brave and\nnoble deeds; and one would naturally expect that I would indulge in a\nfew dreams of chivalry and romance, picture to myself a bright and\nglorious future, pounds' weight of medals and crosses, including the\nVictoria, kiss the hilt of my sword, and all that sort of thing.I was too wretchedly cold for one reason, and the only feeling I\nhad was one of shyness; as for duty, I knew I could and would do that,\nas most of my countrymen had done before me; so I left castle-building\nto the younger sons of noblemen or gentry, whose parents can afford to\nallow them two or three hundred pounds a year to eke out their pay and\nsmooth the difficulties of the service.Not having been fortunate\nenough to be born with even a horn spoon in my mouth, I had to be\ncontent with my education as my fortune, and my navy pay as my only\nincome.\"Stabird side, I dessay, sir?\"\"Certainly,\" said I, having a glimmering idea that it must be the proper\nside.A few minutes after--\"The Admiral's gig is going there, sir,--better\nwait a bit.\"I looked on shore and _did_ see a gig, and two horses\nattached to it.\"No,\" said I, \"decidedly not, he can't see us here, man.I suppose you\nwant to go sticking your dirty wet oars in the air, do you?\"--(I had\nseen pictures of this performance).<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.\"Drive on, I mean pull ahead, my\nhearty\"--a phrase I had heard at the theatre, and considered highly\nnautical.The waterman obeyed, and here is what came of it.We were just\napproaching the ladder, when I suddenly became sensible of a rushing\nnoise.I have a dim recollection of seeing a long, many-oared boat,\ncarrying a large red flag, and with an old grey-haired officer sitting\nastern; of hearing a voice--it might have belonged to the old man of the\nsea, for anything I could have told to the contrary--float down the\nwind,--\n\n\"Clear the way with that (something) bumboat!\"Then came a crash, my\nheels flew up--I had been sitting on the gunwale--and overboard I went\nwith a splash, just as some one else in the long boat sang out.there was a little too much way for me.When I came\nto the surface of the water, I found myself several yards from the\nladder, and at once struck out for it.There was a great deal of noise\nand shouting, and a sailor held towards me the sharp end of a boathook;\nbut I had no intention of being lugged out as if I were a pair of canvas\ntrowsers, and, calling to the sailor to keep his pole to himself--did he\nwant to knock my eye out?--I swam to the ladder and ascended.Thus then\nI joined the service, and, having entered at the foot of the ladder, I\ntrust some day to find myself at the top of it.And, talking of joining the service, I here beg to repudiate, as an\nutter fabrication, the anecdote--generally received as authentic in the\nservice--of the Scotch doctor, who, going to report himself for the\nfirst time on board of the `Victory,' knocked at the door, and inquired\n(at a marine, I think), \"Is this the Royal Nauvy?--'cause I'm come till\njine.\"The story bears \"fib\" on the face of it, for there is not a\nScottish schoolboy but knows that one ship does not make a navy, any\nmore than one swallow does a summer.But, dear intending candidate, if you wish to do the right thing, array\nyourself quietly in frock-coat, cap--not cocked hat, remember--and\nsword, and go on board your ship in any boat you please, only keep out\nof the way of gigs.When you arrive on board, don't be expecting to see\nthe admiral, because you'll be disappointed; but ask a sailor or marine\nto point you out the midshipman of the watch, and request the latter to\nshow you the commander.Make this request civilly, mind you; do not\npull his ear, because, if big and hirsute, he might beat you, which\nwould be a bad beginning.When you meet the commander, don't rush up\nand shake him by the hand, and begin talking about the weather; walk\nrespectfully up to him, and lift your cap as you would to a lady; upon\nwhich he will hurriedly point to his nose with his forefinger, by way of\nreturning the salute, while at the same time you say--\n\n\"_Come_ on board, sir--to _join_, sir.\"It is the custom of the Service to make this remark in a firm, bold,\ndecided tone, placing the emphasis on the \"_come_\" to show clearly that\nyou _did come_, and that no one kicked, or dragged, or otherwise brought\nyou on board against your will.The proper intonation of the remark may\nbe learned from any polite waiter at a hotel, when he tells you,\n\"Dinner's ready, sir, please;\" or it may be heard in the \"Now then,\ngents,\" of the railway guard of the period.Having reported yourself to the man of three stripes, you must not\nexpect that he will shake hands, or embrace you, ask you on shore to\ntea, and introduce you to his wife.No, if he is good-natured, and has\nnot had a difference of opinion with the captain lately, he _may_\ncondescend to show you your cabin and introduce you to your messmates;\nbut if he is out of temper, he will merely ask your name, and, on your\ntelling him, remark, \"Humph!\"then call the most minute midshipman to\nconduct you to your cabin, being at the same time almost certain to\nmispronounce your name.Say your name is Struthers, he will call you\nStutters.\"Here, Mr Pigmy, conduct Mr Stutters to his cabin, and show him where\nthe gunroom--ah!I beg his pardon, the wardroom--lies.\"\"Ay, ay, sir,\" says the middy, and skips off at a round trot, obliging\nyou either to adopt the same ungraceful mode of progression, or lose\nsight of him altogether, and have to wander about, feeling very much\nfrom home, until some officer passing takes pity on you and leads you to\nthe wardroom.It is a way they have in the service, or rather it is the custom of the\npresent Director-General, not to appoint the newly-entered medical\nofficer at once to a sea-going ship, but instead to one or other of the\nnaval hospitals for a few weeks or even months, in order that he may be\nput up to the ropes, as the saying is, or duly initiated into the\nmysteries of service and routine of duty.This is certainly a good\nidea, although it is a question whether it would not be better to adopt\nthe plan they have at Netley, and thus put the navy and army on the same\nfooting.Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth is a great rambling barrack-looking block\nof brick building, with a yard or square surrounded by high walls in\nfront, and with two wings extending from behind, which, with the chapel\nbetween, form another and smaller square.There are seldom fewer than a thousand patients within, and, independent\nof a whole regiment of male and female nurses, sick-bay-men, servants,\ncooks, _et id genus omne_, there is a regular staff of officers,\nconsisting of a captain--of what use I have yet to learn--two medical\ninspector-generals, generally three or four surgeons, the same number of\nregularly appointed assistant-surgeons, besides from ten to twenty\nacting assistant-surgeons [Note 1] waiting for appointments, and doing\nduty as supernumeraries.Of this last class I myself was a member.Soon as the clock tolled the hour of eight in the morning, the\nstaff-surgeon of our side of the hospital stalked into the duty cabin,\nwhere we, the assistants, were waiting to receive him.Immediately\nafter, we set out on the morning visit, each of us armed with a little\nboard or palette to be used as a writing-desk, an excise inkstand slung\nin a buttonhole, and a quill behind the ear.The large doors were\nthrown open, the beds neat and tidy, and the nurses \"standing by.\"Up\neach side of the long wards, from bed to bed, we journeyed; notifying\nthe progress of each case, repeating the treatment here, altering or\nsuspending it there, and performing small operations in another place;\nlistening attentively to tales of aches and pains, and hopes and fears,\nand just in a sort of general way acting the part of good Samaritans.From one ward to another we went, up and down long staircases, along\nlengthy corridors, into wards in the attics, into wards on the basement,\nand into wards below ground,--fracture wards, Lazarus wards, erysipelas\nwards, men's wards, officers' wards; and thus we spent the time till a\nlittle past nine, by which time the relief of so much suffering had\ngiven us an appetite, and we hurried off to the messroom to breakfast.The medical mess at Haslar is one of the finest in the service.Attached to the room is a nice little apartment, fitted up with a\nbagatelle-table, and boxing gloves and foils _ad libitum_.And, sure\nenough, you might walk many a weary mile, or sail many a knot, without\nmeeting twenty such happy faces as every evening surrounded our\ndinner-table, without beholding twenty such bumper glasses raised at\nonce to the toast of Her Majesty the Queen, and without hearing twenty\nsuch good songs, or five times twenty such yarns and original bons-mots,\nas you would at Haslar Medical Mess.Yet I must confess we partook in\nbut a small degree indeed of the solemn quietude of Wordsworth's--\n\n  \"--Party in a parlour cramm'd,\n  Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,\n  But, as you by their faces see,\n  All silent--and all damned.\"I do not deny that we were a little noisy at times, and that on several\noccasions, having eaten and drunken till we were filled, we rose up to\ndance, and consequently received a _polite_ message from the inspector\nwhose house was adjoining, requesting us to \"stop our _confounded_ row;\"\nbut then the old man was married, and no doubt his wife was at the\nbottom of it.Duty was a thing that did not fall to the lot of us supers every day.We took it turn about, and hard enough work it used to be too.As soon\nas breakfast was over, the medical officer on duty would hie him away to\nthe receiving-room, and seat himself at the large desk; and by-and-bye\nthe cases would begin to pour in.First there would arrive, say three\nor four blue-jackets, with their bags under their arms, in charge of an\nassistant-surgeon, then a squad of marines, then more blue-jackets, then\nmore red-coats, and so the game of _rouge-et-noir_ would go on during\nthe day.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.The officer on duty has first to judge whether or not the case\nis one that can be admitted,--that is, which cannot be conveniently\ntreated on board; he has then to appoint the patient a bed in a proper\nward, and prescribe for him, almost invariably a bath and a couple of\npills.Besides, he has to enter the previous history of the case,\nverbatim, into each patient's case-book, and if the cases are numerous,\nand the assistant-surgeon who brings them has written an elaborate\naccount of each disease, the duty-officer will have had his work cut out\nfor him till dinner-time at least.Before the hour of the patient's\ndinner, this gentleman has also to glance into each ward, to see if\neverything is right, and if there are any complaints.Even when ten or\neleven o'clock at night brings sleep and repose to others, his work is\nnot yet over; he has one other visit to pay any time during the night\nthrough all his wards.Then with dark-lantern and slippers you may meet\nhim, gliding ghost-like along the corridors or passages, lingering at\nward doors, listening on the staircases, smelling and snuffing, peeping\nand keeking, and endeavouring by eye, or ear, or nose, to detect the\nslightest irregularity among the patients or nurses, such as burning\nlights without orders, gambling by the light of the fire, or smoking.This visit paid, he may return to his virtuous cabin, and sleep as\nsoundly as he chooses.Very few of the old surgeons interfere with the duties of their\nassistants, but there _be_ men who seem to think you have merely come to\nthe service to learn, not to practise your profession, and therefore\nthey treat you as mere students, or at the best hobble-de-hoy doctors.Of this class was Dr Gruff, a man whom I would back against the whole\nprofession for caudle, clyster, castor-oil, or linseed poultice; but\nwho, I rather suspect, never prescribed a dose of chiretta, santonin, or\nlithia-water in his life.He came to me one duty-day, in a great hurry,\nand so much excited that I judged he had received some grievous bodily\nailment, or suffered some severe family bereavement.\"Well, sir,\" he cried; \"I hear, sir, you have put a case of ulcer into\nthe erysipelas ward.\"This remark, not partaking of the nature of question, I thought required\nno answer.\"Is it true, sir?--is it true?\"\"And what do you mean by it, sir?he\nexclaimed, waxing more and more wroth.\"Yes, sir,\" continued I, my Highland blood getting uppermost, \"I _did_\nthink that, the case being one of ulcer of an _erysipelatous_ nature, I\nwas--\"\n\n\"Erysipelatous ulcer!\"said he, \"that alters the\ncase.I beg your pardon;\" and he\ntrotted off again.\"All right,\" thought I, \"old Gruff.But although there are not wanting medical officers in the service who,\non being promoted to staff-surgeon, appear to forget that ever they wore\nless than three stripes, and can keep company with no one under the rank\nof commander, I am happy to say they are few and far between, and every\nyear getting more few and farther between.It is a fine thing to be appointed for, say three or four years to a\nhome hospital; in fact, it is the assistant-surgeon's highest ambition.Next, in point of comfort, would be an appointment at the Naval Hospital\nof Malta, Cape of Good Hope, or China.The acting assistant-surgeons are those who have not as yet\nserved the probationary year, or been confirmed.They are liable to be\ndismissed without a court-martial.A STORM IN BISCAY BAY.For the space of six weeks I lived in clover at Haslar, and at the end\nof that time my appointment to a sea-going ship came.It was the\npleasure of their Lordships the Commissioners, that I should take my\npassage to the Cape of Good Hope in a frigate, which had lately been put\nin commission and was soon about to sail.Arrived there, I was to be\nhanded over to the flag-ship on that station for disposal, like so many\nstones of salt pork.On first entering the service every medical\nofficer is sent for one commission (three to five years) to a foreign\nstation; and it is certainly very proper too that the youngest and\nstrongest men, rather than the oldest, should do the rough work of the\nservice, and go to the most unhealthy stations.The frigate in which I was ordered passage was to sail from Plymouth.To that town I was accordingly sent by train, and found the good ship in\nsuch a state of internal chaos--painters, carpenters, sail-makers, and\nsailors; armourers, blacksmiths, gunners, and tailors; every one engaged\nat his own trade, with such an utter disregard of order or regularity,\nwhile the decks were in such confusion, littered with tools, nails,\nshavings, ropes, and spars, among which I scrambled, and over which I\ntumbled, getting into everybody's way, and finding so little rest for\nthe sole of my foot, that I was fain to beg a week's leave, and glad\nwhen I obtained it.On going on board again at the end of that time, a\nvery different appearance presented itself; everything was in its proper\nplace, order and regularity were everywhere.The decks were white and\nclean, the binnacles, the brass and mahogany work polished, the gear all\ntaut, the ropes coiled, and the vessel herself sitting on the water\nsaucy as the queen of ducks, with her pennant flying and her beautiful\nensign floating gracefully astern.The gallant ship was ready for sea,\nhad been unmoored, had made her trial trips, and was now anchored in the\nSound.From early morning to busy noon, and from noon till night, boats\nglided backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore, filled\nwith the friends of those on board, or laden with wardroom and gunroom\nstores.Among these might have been seen a shore-boat, rowed by two\nsturdy watermen, and having on board a large sea-chest, with a naval\nofficer on top of it, grasping firmly a", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "The boat was filled with any number of smaller\npackages, among which were two black portmanteaus, warranted to be the\nbest of leather, and containing the gentleman's dress and undress\nuniforms; these, however, turned out to be mere painted pasteboard, and\nin a very few months the cockroaches--careless, merry-hearted\ncreatures--after eating up every morsel of them, turned their attention\nto the contents, on which they dined and supped for many days, till the\nofficer's dress-coat was like a meal-sieve, and his pantaloons might\nhave been conveniently need for a landing-net.This, however, was a\nmatter of small consequence, for, contrary to the reiterated assurance\nof his feline friend, no one portion of this officer's uniform held out\nfor a longer period than six months, the introduction of any part of his\nperson into the corresponding portion of his raiment having become a\nmatter of matutinal anxiety and distress, lest a solution of continuity\nin the garment might be the unfortunate result.About six o'clock on a beautiful Wednesday evening, early in the month\nof May, our gallant and saucy frigate turned her bows seaward and slowly\nsteamed away from amidst the fleet of little boats that--crowded with\nthe unhappy wives and sweethearts of the sailors--had hung around us all\nthe afternoon.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.Puffing and blowing a great deal, and apparently panting\nto be out and away at sea, the good ship nevertheless left her anchorage\nbut slowly, and withal reluctantly, her tears falling thick and fast on\nthe quarter-deck as she went.The band was playing a slow and mournful air, by way of keeping up our\nspirits._I_ had no friends to say farewell to, there was no tear-bedimmed eye to\ngaze after me until I faded in distance; so I stood on the poop, leaning\nover the bulwarks, after the fashion of Vanderdecken, captain of the\nFlying Dutchman, and equally sad and sorrowful-looking.And what did I\nsee from my elevated situation?A moving picture, a living panorama; a\nbright sky sprinkled with a few fleecy cloudlets, over a blue sea all in\nmotion before a fresh breeze of wind; a fleet of little boats astern,\nfilled with picturesquely dressed seamen and women waving handkerchiefs;\nthe long breakwater lined with a dense crowd of sorrowing friends, each\nanxious to gain one last look of the dear face he may never see more.Yonder is the grey-haired father, yonder the widowed mother, the\naffectionate brother, the loving sister, the fond wife, the beloved\nsweetheart,--all are there; and not a sigh that is sighed, not a tear\nthat is shed, not a prayer that is breathed, but finds a response in the\nbosom of some loved one on board.To the right are green hills,\npeople-clad likewise, while away in the distance the steeple of many a\nchurch \"points the way to happier spheres,\" and on the flagstaff at the\nport-admiral's house is floating the signal \"Fare thee well.\"The band has ceased to play, the sailors have given their last ringing\ncheer, even the echoes of which have died away, and faintly down the\nwind comes the sound of the evening bells.The men are gathered in\nlittle groups on deck, and there is a tenderness in their landward gaze,\nand a pathos in their rough voices, that one would hardly expect to\nfind.\"Yonder's my Poll, Jack,\" says one.the poor lass is\ncrying; blowed if I think I'll ever see her more.\"\"There,\" says another, \"is _my_ old girl on the breakwater, beside the\nold cove in the red nightcap.\"\"That's my father, Bill,\" answers a third.\"Good-bye, Jean; good-bye, lass.Blessed if I\ndon't feel as if I could make a big baby of myself and cry outright.\"Dick, Dick,\" exclaims an honest-looking tar; \"I see'd my poor wife\ntumble down; she had wee Johnnie in her arms, and--and what will I do?\"\"Keep up your heart, to be sure,\" answers a tall, rough son of a gun.\"There, she has righted again, only a bit of a swoon ye see.I've got\nneither sister, wife, nor mother, so surely it's _me_ that ought to be\nmaking a noodle of myself; but where's the use?\"An hour or two later we were steaming across channel, with nothing\nvisible but the blue sea all before us, and the chalky cliffs of\nCornwall far behind, with the rosy blush of the setting sun lingering on\ntheir summits.Then the light faded from the sky, the gloaming star shone out in the\neast, big waves began to tumble in, and the night breeze blew cold and\nchill from off the broad Atlantic Ocean.Tired and dull, weary and sad, I went below to the wardroom and seated\nmyself on a rocking chair.It was now that I began to feel the\ndiscomfort of not having a cabin.Being merely a supernumerary or\npassenger, such a luxury was of course out of the question, even had I\nbeen an admiral.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.I was to have a screen berth, or what a landsman would\ncall a canvas tent, on the main or fighting deck, but as yet it was not\nrigged.Had I never been to sea before, I would have now felt very\nwretched indeed; but having roughed it in Greenland and Davis Straits in\nsmall whaling brigs, I had got over the weakness of sea-sickness; yet\nnotwithstanding I felt all the thorough prostration both of mind and\nbody, which the first twenty-four hours at sea often produces in the\noldest and best of sailors, so that I was only too happy when I at last\nfound myself within canvas.By next morning the wind had freshened, and when I turned out I found\nthat the steam had been turned off, and that we were bowling along\nbefore a ten-knot breeze.All that day the wind blew strongly from the\nN.N.E., and increased as night came on to a regular gale of wind.I had\nseen some wild weather in the Greenland Ocean, but never anything\nbefore, nor since, to equal the violence of the storm on that dreadful\nnight, in the Bay of Biscay.We were running dead before the wind at\ntwelve o'clock, when the gale was at its worst, and when the order to\nlight fires and get up steam had been given.Just then we were making\nfourteen knots, with only a foresail, a fore-topsail, and main-topsail,\nthe latter two close-reefed.I was awakened by a terrific noise on\ndeck, and I shall not soon forget that awakening.The ship was leaking\nbadly both at the ports and scupper-holes; so that the maindeck all\naround was flooded with water, which lifted my big chest every time the\nroll of the vessel allowed it to flow towards it.To say the ship was\nrolling would express but poorly the indescribably disagreeable\nwallowing motion of the frigate, while men were staggering with anxious\nfaces from gun to gun, seeing that the lashings were all secure; so\ngreat was the strain on the cable-like ropes that kept them in their\nplaces.The shot had got loose from the racks, and were having a small\ncannonade on their own account, to the no small consternation of the men\nwhose duty it was to re-secure them.It was literally sea without and\nsea within, for the green waves were pouring down the main hatchway,\nadding to the amount of water already _below_, where the chairs and\nother articles of domestic utility were all afloat and making voyages of\ndiscovery from one officer's cabin to another.On the upper deck all was darkness, confusion, and danger, for both the\nfore and main-topsails had been carried away at the same time, reducing\nus to one sail--the foresail.The noise and crackling of the riven\ncanvas, mingling with the continuous roar of the storm, were at times\nincreased by the rattle of thunder and the rush of rain-drops, while the\nlightning played continually around the slippery masts and cordage.About one o'clock, a large ship, apparently unmanageable, was dimly seen\nfor one moment close aboard of us--had we come into collision the\nconsequences must have been dreadful;--and thus for two long hours,\n_till steam was got up_, did we fly before the gale, after which the\ndanger was comparatively small.Having spent its fury, having in fact blown itself out of breath, the\nwind next day retired to its cave, and the waves got smaller and\nbeautifully less, till peace and quietness once more reigned around us.Going on deck one morning I found we were anchored under the very shadow\nof a steep rock, and not far from a pretty little town at the foot of a\nhigh mountain, which was itself covered to the top with trees and\nverdure, with the white walls of many a quaint-looking edifice peeping\nthrough the green--boats, laden with fruit and fish and turtle,\nsurrounded the ship.The island of Madeira and town, of Funchal.As\nthere was no pier, we had to land among the stones.The principal\namusement of English residents here seems to be lounging about, cheroot\nin mouth, beneath the rows of trees that droop over the pavements,\ngetting carried about in portable hammocks, and walking or riding (I\nrode, and, not being able to get my horse to move at a suitable pace, I\nlooked behind, and found the boy from whom I had hired him sticking like\na leech to my animal's tail, nor would he be shaken off--nor could the\nhorse be induced to kick him off; this is the custom of the Funchalites,\nand a funny one it is) to the top of the mountain, for the pleasure of\ncoming down in a sleigh, a distance of two miles, in twice as many\nminutes, while the least deviation from the path would result in a\nterrible smash against the wall of either side, but I never heard of any\nsuch accident occurring.Three days at Madeira, and up anchor again; our next place of call being\nSaint Helena.Every one has heard of the gentleman who wanted to\nconquer the world but couldn't, who tried to beat the British but\ndidn't, who staked his last crown at a game of _loo_, and losing fled,\nand fleeing was chased, and being chased was caught and chained by the\nleg, like an obstreperous game-cock, to a rock somewhere in the middle\nof the sea, on which he stood night and day for years, with his arms\nfolded across his chest, and his cocked hat wrong on, a warning to the\nunco-ambitious.The rock was Saint Helena, and a very beautiful rock it\nis too, hill and dell and thriving town, its mountain-sides tilled and\nits straths and glens containing many a fertile little farm.It is the\nduty of every one who touches the shores of this far-famed island to\nmake a pilgrimage to Longwood, the burial-place of the \"great man.\"I\nhave no intention of describing this pilgrimage, for this has been done\nby dozens before my time, or, if not, it ought to have been: I shall\nmerely add a very noticeable fact, which others may not perchance have\nobserved--_both sides_ of the road all the way to the tomb are strewn\nwith _Bass's beer-bottles_, empty of course, and at the grave itself\nthere are hogsheads of them; and the same is the case at every place\nwhich John Bull has visited, or where English foot has ever trodden.The rule holds good all over the world; and in the Indian Ocean,\nwhenever I found an uninhabited island, or even reef which at some\nfuture day would be an island, if I did not likewise find an empty\nbeer-bottle, I at once took possession in the name of Queen Victoria,\ngiving three hips!thrice, and singing \"For he's a jolly\ngood fellow,\" without any very distinct notion as to who _was_ the jolly\nfellow; also adding more decidedly \"which nobody can deny\"--there being\nno one on the island to deny it.England has in this way acquired much additional territory at my hands,\nwithout my having as yet received any very substantial recompense for my\nservices.The duties of the assistant-surgeon--the modern Roderick Random--on\nboard a line-of-battle ship are seldom very onerous in time of peace,\nand often not worth mentioning.Suppose, for example, the reader is\nthat officer.At five bells--half-past six--in the morning, if you\nhappen to be a light sleeper, you will be sensible of some one gliding\nsilently into your cabin, rifling your pockets, and extracting your\nwatch, your money, and other your trinkets; but do not jump out of bed,\npray, with the intention of collaring him; it is no thief--only your\nservant.Formerly this official used to be a marine, with whom on\njoining your ship you bargained in the following manner.The marine walked up to you and touched his front hair, saying at the\nsame time,--\n\n\"_I_ don't mind looking arter you, sir,\" or \"I'll do for you, sir.\"On\nwhich you would reply,--\n\n\"All right!and he would answer \"Cheeks,\" or whatever\nhis name might be.(Cheeks, that is the real Cheeks, being a sort of\nvisionary soldier--a phantom marine--and very useful at times, answering\nin fact to the Nobody of higher quarters, who is to blame for so many\nthings,--\"Nobody is to blame,\" and \"Cheeks is to blame,\" being\nsynonymous sentences.)Now-a-days Government kindly allows each commissioned officer one half\nof a servant, or one whole one between two officers, which, at times, is\nfound to be rather an awkward arrangement; as, for instance, you and,\nsay, the lieutenant of marines, have each the half of the same servant,\nand you wish your half to go on shore with a message, and the lieutenant\nrequires his half to remain on board: the question then comes to be one\nwhich only the wisdom of Solomon could solve, in the same way that\nAlexander the Great loosed the Gordian knot.Your servant, then, on entering your cabin in the morning, carefully and\nquietly deposits the contents of your pockets on your table, and, taking\nall your clothes and your boots in his arms, silently flits from view,\nand shortly after re-enters, having in the interval neatly folded and\nbrushed them.You are just turning round to go to sleep again, when--\n\n\"Six bells, sir, please,\" remarks your man, laying his hand on your\nelbow, and giving you a gentle shake to insure your resuscitation, and\nwhich will generally have the effect of causing you to spring at once\nfrom your cot, perhaps in your hurry nearly upsetting the cup of\ndelicious ship's cocoa which he has kindly saved to you from his own\nbreakfast--a no small sacrifice either, if you bear in mind that his own\nallowance is by no means very large, and that his breakfast consists of\ncocoa and biscuits alone--these last too often containing more weevils\nthan flour.As you hurry into your bath, your servant coolly informs\nyou--\n\n\"Plenty of time, sir.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.\"Then,\" you inquire, \"it isn't six bells?\"\"Not a bit on it, sir,\" he replies; \"wants the quarter.\"At seven o'clock exactly you make your way forward to the sick-bay, on\nthe lower deck at the ship's bows.Now, this making your way forward\nisn't by any means such an easy task as one might imagine; for at that\nhour the deck is swarming with the men at their toilet, stripped to the\nwaist, every man at his tub, lathering, splashing, scrubbing and\nrubbing, talking, laughing, joking, singing, sweating, and swearing.Finding your way obstructed, you venture to touch one mildly on the bare\nback, as a hint to move aside and let you pass; the man immediately\ndamns your eyes, then begs pardon, and says he thought it was Bill \"at\nhis lark again.\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.Another who is bending down over his tub you touch\nmore firmly on the _os innominatum_, and ask him in a free and easy sort\nof tone to \"slue round there.\"He \"slues round,\" very quickly too, but\nunfortunately in the wrong direction, and ten to one capsizes you in a\ntub of dirty soapsuds.Having picked yourself up, you pursue your\njourney, and sing out as a general sort of warning--\n\nFor the benefit of those happy individuals who never saw, or had to eat,\nweevils, I may here state that they are small beetles of the exact size\nand shape of the common woodlouse, and that the taste is rather insipid,\nwith a slight flavour of boiled beans.Never have tasted the woodlouse,\nbut should think the flavour would be quite similar.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.\"Gangway there, lads,\" which causes at least a dozen of these worthies\nto pass such ironical remarks to their companions as--\n\n\"Out of the doctor's way there, Tom.\"\"Let the gentleman pass, can't you, Jack?\"\"Port your helm, Mat; the doctor wants you to.\"\"Round with your stern, Bill; the surgeon's _mate_ is a passing.\"\"Kick that donkey Jones out of the doctor's road,\"--while at the same\ntime it is always the speaker himself who is in the way.At last, however, you reach the sick-bay in safety, and retire within\nthe screen.Here, if a strict service man, you will find the surgeon\nalready seated; and presently the other assistant enters, and the work\nis begun.There is a sick-bay man, or dispenser, and a sick-bay cook,\nattached to the medical department.The surgeon generally does the\nbrain-work, and the assistants the finger-work; and, to their shame be\nit spoken, there are some surgeons too proud to consult their younger\nbrethren, whom they treat as assistant-drudges, not assistant-surgeons.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.At eight o'clock--before or after,--the work is over, and you are off to\nbreakfast.At nine o'clock the drum beats, when every one, not otherwise engaged,\nis required to muster on the quarter-deck, every officer as he comes up\nlifting his cap, not to the captain, but to the Queen.After inspection\nthe parson reads prayers; you are then free to write, or read, or\nanything else in reason you choose; and, if in harbour, you may go on\nshore--boats leaving the ship at regular hours for the convenience of\nthe officers--always premising that one medical man be left on board, in\ncase of accident.In most foreign ports where a ship may be lying,\nthere is no want of both pleasure and excitement on shore.Take for\nexample the little town of Simon's, about twenty miles from Cape Town,\nwith a population of not less than four thousand of Englishmen, Dutch,\nMalays, Caffres, and Hottentots.The bay is large, and almost\nlandlocked.The little white town is built along the foot of a lofty\nmountain.Beautiful walks can be had in every direction, along the hard\nsandy sea-beach, over the mountains and on to extensive table-lands, or\naway up into dark rocky dingles and heath-clad glens.Nothing can\nsurpass the beauty of the scenery, or the gorgeous loveliness of the\nwild heaths and geraniums everywhere abounding.There is a good hotel\nand billiard-room; and you can shoot where, when, and what you please--\nmonkeys, pigeons, rock rabbits, wild ducks, or cobra-di-capellas.If\nyou long for more society, or want to see life, get a day or two days'\nleave.Rise at five o'clock; the morning will be lovely and clear, with\nthe mist rising from its flowery bed on the mountain's brow, and the\nsun, large and red, entering on a sky to which nor pen nor pencil could\ndo justice.The cart is waiting for you at the hotel, with an awning\nspread above.Jump in: crack goes the long Caffre whip; away with a\nplunge and a jerk go the three pairs of Caffre horses, and along the\nsea-shore you dash, with the cool sea-breeze in your face, and the\nwater, green and clear, rippling up over the horses' feet; then, amid\nsuch scenery, with such exhilarating weather, in such a life-giving\nclimate, if you don't feel a glow of pleasure that will send the blood\ntingling through your veins, from the points of your ten toes to the\nextreme end of your eyelashes, there must be something radically and\nconstitutionally wrong with you, and the sooner you go on board and dose\nyourself with calomel and jalap the better.Arrived at Cape Town, a few introductions will simply throw the whole\ncity at your command, and all it contains.I do not intend this as a complete sketch of your trip, or I would have\nmentioned some of the many beautiful spots and places of interest you\npass on the road--Rathfeldas for example, a hotel halfway, a house\nburied in sweetness; and the country round about, with its dark waving\nforests, its fruitful fields and wide-spreading vineyards, where the\ngrape seems to grow almost without cultivation; its comfortable\nfarm-houses; and above all its people, kind, generous, and hospitable as\nthe country is prolific.So you see, dear reader, a navy surgeon's life hath its pleasures.and sorry I am to add, its sufferings too; for a few\npages farther on the picture must change: if we get the lights we must\nneeds take the shadows also.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.We will suppose that the reader still occupies the position of\nassistant-surgeon in a crack frigate or saucy line-of-battle ship.If\nyou go on shore for a walk in the forenoon you may return to lunch at\ntwelve; or if you have extended your ramble far into the country, or\ngone to visit a friend or lady-love--though for the latter the gloaming\nhour is to be preferred--you will in all probability have succeeded in\nestablishing an appetite by half-past five, when the officers'\ndinner-boat leaves the pier.Now, I believe there are few people in the world to whom a good dinner\ndoes not prove an attraction, and this is what in a large ship one is\nalways pretty sure of, more especially on guest-nights, which are\nevenings set apart--one every week--for the entertainment of the\nofficers' friends, one or more of whom any officer may invite, by\npreviously letting the mess-caterer know of his intention.The\nmess-caterer is the officer who has been elected to superintend the\nvictualling, as the wine-caterer does the liquor department, and a\nby-no-means-enviable position it is, and consequently it is for ever\nchanging hands.Sailors are proverbial growlers, and, indeed, a certain\namount of growling is, and ought to be, permitted in every mess; but it\nis scarcely fair for an officer, because his breakfast does not please\nhim, or if he can't get butter to his cheese after dinner, to launch\nforth his indignation at the poor mess-caterer, who most likely is doing\nall he can to please.These growlers too never speak right out or\ndirectly to the point.\"Such and such a ship that I was in,\" says growler first, \"and such and\nsuch a mess--\"\n\n\"Oh, by George!\"says growler second, \"_I_ knew that ship; that was a\nmess, and no mistake?\"\"Why, yes,\" replies number one, \"the lunch we got there was better than\nthe dinner we have in this old clothes-basket.\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.On guest-nights your friend sits beside yourself, of course, and you\nattend to his corporeal wants.One of the nicest things about the\nservice, in my opinion, is the having the band every day at dinner; then\ntoo everything is so orderly; with our president and vice-president, it\nis quite like a pleasure party every evening; so that altogether the\ndinner, while in harbour, comes to be the great event of the day.And\nafter the cloth has been removed, and the president, with a preliminary\nrap on the table to draw attention, has given the only toast of the\nevening, the Queen, and due honour has been paid thereto, and the\nbandmaster, who has been keeking in at the door every minute for the\nlast ten, that he might not make a mistake in the time, has played \"God\nsave the Queen,\" and returned again to waltzes, quadrilles, or\nselections from operas,--then it is very pleasant and delightful to loll\nover our walnuts and wine, and half-dream away the half-hour till coffee\nis served.Then, to be sure, that little cigar in our canvas\nsmoking-room outside the wardroom door, though the last, is by no means\nthe least pleasant part of the _dejeuner_.For my own part, I enjoy the\nsucceeding hour or so as much as any: when, reclining in an easy chair,\nin a quiet corner, I can sip my tea, and enjoy my favourite author to my\nheart's content.You must spare half an hour, however, to pay your last\nvisit to the sick; but this will only tend to make you appreciate your\nease all the more when you have done.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.So the evening wears away, and by\nten o'clock you will probably just be sufficiently tired to enjoy\nthoroughly your little swing-cot and your cool white sheets.At sea, luncheon, or tiffin, is dispensed with, and you dine at\nhalf-past two.Not much difference in the quality of viands after all,\nfor now-a-days everything worth eating can be procured, in hermetically\nsealed tins, capable of remaining fresh for any length of time.There is one little bit of the routine of the service, which at first\none may consider a hardship.You are probably enjoying your deepest, sweetest sleep, rocked in the\ncradle of the deep, and gently swaying to and fro in your little cot;\nyou had turned in with the delicious consciousness of safety, for well\nyou knew that the ship was far away at sea, far from rock or reef or\ndeadly shoal, and that the night was clear and collision very\nimprobable, so you are slumbering like a babe on its mother's breast--as\nyou are for that matter--for the second night-watch is half spent; when,\nmingling confusedly with your dreams, comes the roll of the drum; you\nstart and listen.There is a moment's pause, when birr-r-r-r it goes\nagain, and as you spring from your couch you hear it the third time.And now you can distinguish the shouts of officers and petty officers,\nhigh over the din of the trampling of many feet, of the battening down\nof hatches, of the unmooring of great guns, and of heavy ropes and bars\nfalling on the deck: then succeeds a dead silence, soon broken by the\nvoice of the commander thundering, \"Enemy on the port bow;\" and then,\nand not till then, do you know it is no real engagement, but the monthly\nnight-quarters.And you can't help feeling sorry there isn't a real\nenemy on the port bow, or either bow, as you hurry away to the cockpit,\nwith the guns rattling all the while overhead, as if a real live\nthunderstorm were being taken on board, and was objecting to be stowed\naway.So you lay out your instruments, your sponges, your bottles of\nwine, and your buckets of water, and, seating yourself in the midst,\nbegin to read `Midsummer Night's Dream,' ready at a moment's notice to\namputate the leg of any man on board, whether captain, cook, or\ncabin-boy.Another nice little amusement the officer of the watch may give himself\non fine clear nights is to set fire to and let go the lifebuoy, at the\nsame time singing out at the top of his voice, \"Man overboard.\"A boatswain's mate at once repeats the call, and vociferates down the\nmain hatchway, \"Life-boat's crew a-ho-oy!\"In our navy a few short but expressive moments of silence ever precede\nthe battle, that both officers and men may hold communion with their\nGod.The men belonging to this boat, who have been lying here and there\nasleep but dressed, quickly tumble up the ladder pell-mell; there is a\nrattling of oars heard, and the creaking of pulleys, then a splash in\nthe water alongside, the boat darts away from the ship like an arrow\nfrom a bow, and the crew, rowing towards the blazing buoy, save the life\nof the unhappy man, Cheeks the marine.And thus do British sailors rule the waves and keep old Neptune in his\nown place.CONTAINING--IF NOT THE WHOLE--NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.If the disposing, in the service, of even a ship-load of\nassistant-surgeons, is considered a matter of small moment, my disposal,\nafter reaching the Cape of Good Hope, needs but small comment.I was\nvery soon appointed to take charge of a gunboat, in lieu of a gentleman\nwho was sent to the Naval Hospital of Simon's Town, to fill a death\nvacancy--for the navy as well as nature abhors a vacuum.I had seen the\nbright side of the service, I was now to have my turn of the dark; I had\nenjoyed life on board a crack frigate, I was now to rough it in a\ngunboat.The east coast of Africa was to be our cruising ground, and our ship a\npigmy steamer, with plenty fore-and-aft about her, but nothing else; in\nfact, she was Euclid's definition of a line to a t, length without\nbreadth, and small enough to have done \"excellently well\" as a Gravesend\ntug-boat.Her teeth were five: namely, one gigantic cannon, a\n65-pounder, as front tooth; on each side a brass howitzer; and flanking\nthese, two canine tusks in shape of a couple of 12-pounder Armstrongs.With this armament we were to lord it with a high hand over the Indian\nOcean; carry fire and sword, or, failing sword, the cutlass, into the\nvery heart of slavery's dominions; the Arabs should tremble at the roar\nof our guns and the thunder of our bursting shells, while the slaves\nshould clank their chains in joyful anticipation of our coming; and best\nof all, we--the officers--should fill our pockets with prize-money to\nspend when we again reached the shores of merry England.Unfortunately,\nthis last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,\nfor, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all\nour hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers\nand crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they\notherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were\ncovered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the\nfar-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock\nnoon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated\naround the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by\ncourtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant\ncommanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and\nfive cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--\nnamely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who\nwas our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young\ngentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,\nbrimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,\nbright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a \"wee\nwee man,\" dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess\nbecause he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is\ncelebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness\nof its inner man.\"Come along, old fellow,\" said our navigator, addressing me as I entered\nthe messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by\ncoming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--\"come\nalong and join us, we don't dine till four.\"\"And precious little to dine upon,\" said the officer on his right.\"Steward, let us have the rum,\" [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black\nbottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large\nmouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable\nrather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair\nof dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of\nblacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be\nthe exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue\nserge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had\nneither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,\nbiscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; \"that beggar\nDawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's.\"I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know,\" said the\nassistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping\nhimself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the\nglass from the table and", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "\"Soul or no soul,\" replied the youthful man of money as he gazed\ndisconsolately at the empty glass, \"my _spirit's_ gone.\"\"Blessed,\" said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, \"if you devils\nhave left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow.\"And they all said \"Where is the doctor's?\"\"See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat\nof butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay\nto-morrow.\"These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little\ninsight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my\nfuture messmates.\"Steward,\" said I, \"show me my cabin.\"He did so;\nindeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the\nsmallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most\nmiserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on\nshore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or\nguinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.The building was constructed by\nHenry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the\ntimes would allow.It was situated on Third street near Market, and\nin the early days was considered St.In its\nparlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature\nwas held, and the supreme court of the territory also used it for\nseveral terms.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on\nRobert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery\nelement.These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time\nof their destruction.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever\noccurred in St.Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third\nstreet near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three\nengines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on\nhand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach.Nearly all the\nbuildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were\ntwo-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses\noccupied by the owners of the stores.When the fire was at its height\nit was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before\nthe flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the\nfiremen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had\nthe immense smouldering mass under control.Thirty-four buildings, the\nlargest number ever destroyed in St.Of the two\nblocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above\nJackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone\nstructures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and\nthe other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L.The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the\nfirst hotels built in St.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.The New England\nwas a feature in St.Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the\nfirst gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.Ramsey had\nbegun housekeeping in 1849.The Empire saloon was another historic\nruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the\nterritory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first\nPioneer, April 10, 1849.The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also\ndestroyed at this fire.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was\nentirely destroyed by fire.A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused\nthe fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control\nof the firemen when they arrived upon the scene.A few pieces of\nfurniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular\nhotel.The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the\nexception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city.The hotel\nwas constructed in 1854 by the late J.M.Winslow was one\nof the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West.In some peculiar\nmanner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building\nwithout any capital, but when the building was completed he not only\nhad the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a\nfinancier as well as a builder.The proprietors of the Winslow were\narrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were\ndischarged.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was\none of the landmarks of the city for a good many years.It was built\nin 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel\nas their headquarters.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Although it was of very peculiar architecture,\nthe interior fittings were of a modern character.On a stormy night in\nthe month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this\nhotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire\nwas beyond their control.The weather was bitter cold, and the water\nwould be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose.Finding their\nefforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their\nattention to saving the guests.There were some very narrow escapes,\nbut no accidents of a very serious nature.As usual, thieves were\npresent and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and\nwearing apparel belonging to the guests.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story\nbrick building on the corner of Third and Franklin streets.It was\noccupied by them as a banking house for a long time.The business\ncenter having been moved further down the street, they were compelled\nto seek quarters on Bridge Square.After the bank moved out of\nthis building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them\nremodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about\n$20,000.It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized.When the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom\nlost all they possessed.The Linden theatrical company, which was\nplaying at the Athenaeum, was among the heavy sufferers.At this fire\na large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street\nwere destroyed.When the Cosmopolitan hotel burned the walls of the old building were\nleft standing, and although they were pronounced dangerous by the city\nauthorities, had not been demolished.Schell, one of the best\nknown physicians of the city, occupied a little frame building near\nthe hotel, and he severely denounced the city authorities for their\nlax enforcement of the law.One night at 10 o'clock the city was\nvisited by a terrific windstorm, and suddenly a loud crash was heard\nin the vicinity of the doctor's office.A portion of the walls of the\nhotel had fallen and the little building occupied by the doctor had\nbeen crushed in.The fire alarm was turned on and the fire laddies\nwere soon on the spot.No one supposed the doctor was alive, but after\nthe firemen had been at work a short time they could hear the voice\nof the doctor from underneath the rubbish.In very vigorous English,\nwhich the doctor knew so well how to use, he roundly upbraided the\nfire department for not being more expeditious in extricating him from\nhis perilous position.After the doctor had been taken out of the\nruins It was found that he had not been seriously injured, and in the\ncourse of a few weeks was able to resume practice.*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the winter of 1868 the Emmert house, situated on Bench street\nnear Wabasha, was destroyed by fire.The Emmert house was built in\nterritorial times by Fred Emmert, who for some time kept a hotel and\nboarding house at that place.It had not been used for hotel purposes\nfor some time, but was occupied by a  family and used as a\nboarding-house for <DW52> people.While the flames were rapidly\nconsuming the old building the discovery was made that a man and\nhis wife were sick in one of the rooms with smallpox.The crowd of\nonlookers fled in terror, and they would have been burned alive had\nnot two courageous firemen carried them out of the building.It was\nan unusually cold night and the <DW52> people were dumped into the\nmiddle of the street and there allowed to remain.They were provided\nwith clothing and some of the more venturesome even built a fire for\nthem, but no one would volunteer to take them to a place of shelter.About 10 o'clock on the following day the late W.L.Wilson learned\nof the unfortunate situation of the two <DW52> people, and he\nimmediately procured a vehicle and took them to a place of safety, and\nalso saw that they were thereafter properly cared for.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the site of the old postoffice on the corner of Wabasha and Fifth\nstreets stood the Mansion house, a three-story frame building erected\nby Nicholas Pottgieser in early days at an expense of $12,000.It was\na very popular resort and for many years the weary traveler there\nreceived a hearty welcome.A very exciting event occurred at this house during the summer of\n1866.A man by the name of Hawkes, a guest at the hotel, accidentally\nshot and instantly killed his young and beautiful wife.He was\narrested and tried for murder, but after a long and sensational trial\nwas acquited.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe greatest hotel fire in the history of St.The International hotel (formerly the Fuller\nhouse) was situated on the northeast corner of Seventh and Jackson\nstreets, and was erected by A.G.It was built of brick\nand was five stories high.It cost when completed, about $110,000.For\nyears it had been the best hotel in the West.William H. Seward and\nthe distinguished party that accompanied him made this hotel their\nheadquarters during their famous trip to the West in 1860.Sibley had their headquarters in this building, and from here\nemanated all the orders relating to the war against the rebellious\nSioux.In 1861 the property came into the possession of Samuel Mayall,\nand he changed the name of it from Fuller house to International\nhotel.Belote, who had formerly been the landlord of the\nMerchants, was the manager of the hotel.The fire broke out in the\nbasement, it was supposed from a lamp in the laundry.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.The night was\nintensely cold, a strong gale blowing from the northwest.Not a soul\ncould be seen upon the street.Within this great structure more than\ntwo hundred guests were wrapped in silent slumber.To rescue them from\ntheir perilous position was the problem that required instant action\non the part of the firemen and the hotel authorities.The legislature\nwas then in session, and many of the members were among the guests who\ncrowded the hotel.A porter was the first to notice the blaze, and\nhe threw a pail water upon it, but with the result that it made no\nimpression upon the flames.The fire continued to extend, and the\nsmoke became very dense and spread into the halls, filling them\ncompletely, rendering breathing almost an impossibility.In the\nmeantime the alarm had been given throughout the house, and the\nguests, both male and female, came rushing out of the rooms in their\nnight Clothes.The broad halls of the hotel were soon filled with a\ncrowd of people who hardly knew which way to go in order to find their\nway to the street.The servant girls succeeded in getting out first,\nand made their way to the snow-covered streets without sufficient\nclothing to protect their persons, and most of them were without\nshoes.While the people were escaping from the building the fire was\nmaking furious and rapid progress.From the laundry the smoke issued\ninto every portion of the building.There was no nook or corner that\nthe flames did not penetrate.The interior of the building burned with\ngreat rapidity until the fire had eaten out the eastern and southern\nrooms, when the walls began to give indications of falling.The upper\nportion of them waved back and forth in response to a strong wind,\nwhich filled the night air with cinders.At last different portions of\nthe walls fell, thus giving the flames an opportunity to sweep from\nthe lower portions of the building.Great gusts, which seemed to\nalmost lift the upper floors, swept through the broken walls.High up\nover the building the flames climbed, carrying with them sparks and\ncinders, and in come instances large pieces of timber.All that saved\nthe lower part of the city from fiery destruction was the fact that a\nsolid bed of snow a foot deep lay upon the roofs of all the buildings.During all this time there was comparative quiet, notwithstanding the\nfact that the fire gradually extended across Jackson street and also\nacross Seventh street.Besides the hotel, six or eight other buildings\nwere also on fire, four of which were destroyed.Women and men were to\nbe seen hurrying out of the burning buildings in their night\nclothes, furniture was thrown into the street, costly pianos, richly\nupholstered furniture, valuable pictures and a great many other\nexpensive articles were dropped in the snow in a helter-skelter\nmanner.Although nearly every room in the hotel was occupied and\nrumors flew thick and fast that many of the guests were still in their\nrooms, fortunately no lives were lost and no one was injured.The\ncoolest person in the building was a young man by the name of Pete\nO'Brien, the night watchman.When he heard of the fire he comprehended\nin a moment the danger of a panic among over two hundred people who\nwere locked in sleep, unconscious of danger.He went from room to room\nand from floor to floor, telling them of the danger, but assuring them\nall that they had plenty of time to escape.He apparently took command\nof the excited guests and issued orders like a general on the field of\nbattle.To his presence of mind and coolness many of the guests were\nindebted for their escape from a frightful death.The fire department\nworked hard and did good service.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.The city had no waterworks at that\ntime, but relied for water entirely upon cisterns located in different\nparts of the city.When the cisterns became dry it was necessary\nto place the steamer at the river and pump water through over two\nthousand feet of hose.Among the guests at the hotel at the time of the fire were Gen.Le Duc, Selah\nChamberlain, Gov.Armstrong and wife, Charles A. Gilman and wife,\nDr.Dunnell, Judge\nThomas Wilson and more than two hundred others.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Park Place hotel on the corner of Summit avenue and St.Peter\nstreet, was at one time one of of the swell hotels of the city.It\nwas a frame building, four stories high and nicely situated.The\nproprietors of it intended it should be a family hotel, but it did not\nmeet with the success anticipated, and when, on the 19th of May, 1878,\nit was burned to the ground it was unoccupied.The fire was thought\nto be the work of incendiaries.The loss was about $20,000, partially\ninsured.Four firemen were quite seriously injured at this fire, but\nall recovered.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Carpenter house, on the corner of Summit avenue and Ramsey street,\nwas built by Warren Carpenter.Carpenter was a man of colossal\nideas, and from the picturesque location of his hotel, overlooking the\ncity, he could see millions of tourists flocking to his hostelry.The\npanic of 1857, soon followed by the great Civil war, put a quietus on\nimmigration, and left him stranded high on the beach.Carpenter's\ndream of millions were far from being realized, and when on the 26th\nof January, 1879, the hotel was burned to the ground, it had for some\ntime previous passed beyond his control.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt one time there were three flourishing hotels on Bench street.The average citizen of to-day does not know that such a street ever\nexisted.The Central house, on the corner of Bench and Minnesota\nstreets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city,\nand it was one of the last to be burned.The first session of the\nterritorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of\nthis old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a\nthriving business.As the city grew it was made over into a large\nboarding house, and before the war Mrs.Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben\nFerris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by\nfire.The building was burned In August, 1873.*       *       *       *       *\n\nA hotel that was very popular for some time was the Greenman house,\nsituated on the corner of Fifth and St.Peter streets, the site of the\nWindsor hotel.It was a three-story frame structure and was built in\nthe early seventies.Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and\nthen sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was\nburned.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and\nthat only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make\nroom for the present building many years ago.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that\never occurred at a fire in St.Paul took place in May, 1870, when the\nold Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed.Concert Hall was built by the late J.W.McClung in 1857, and the hall\nin the basement was one of the largest in the city.The building was\nthree stories high in front and six or seven on the river side.It\nwas located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk.Under the\nsidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from\nhere that the fire was first noticed.In an incredibly short time\nflames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost\nimpossible.On the river side of the building on the top floor two\nbrothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop.The fire\nspread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames\nbefore they even thought their lives were endangered.In front of them\nwas a seething mass of flames and the distance to the ground on the\nriver side was so great that a leap from the window meant almost\ncertain death.They could be plainly seen frantically calling for\nhelp.Finally Charles Mueller\njumped out on the window sill and made a leap for life, and an instant\nlater he was followed by his brother.The bewildered spectators did\nnot suppose for a moment that either could live.They were too much\nhorrified to speak, but when it was over and they were lifted into\nbeds provided for them doctors were called and recovery was pronounced\npossible.August Mueller is\nstill living in the city.A lady by the name of McClellan, who had a\ndressmaking establishment in the building, was burned to death and it\nwas several days before her body was recovered.The following named men have been chiefs of the St.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Paul fire\ndepartment:\n\n  Wash M.

Emmett, chief justice of the supreme court of the State\nof Minnesota.The judge, dignified and aristocratic, did not take\nkindly to the idea of his brother being a minstrel.Dan was not\nparticularly elated because his brother was on the supreme bench.They\nwere wholly indifferent as to each other's welfare.They did not even\nspell their names the same way.Dan had only one \"t\" at the end of his\nname, while the judge used two.Whether the judge used two because\nhe was ashamed of Dan, or whether Dan used only one because he was\nashamed of the judge, no one seemed to know.Dan Emmet left a legacy\nthat will be remembered by the lovers of melody for many years.Paul they got stranded\nand many of them found engagements in other organizations.Dan turned\nhis attention to writing <DW64> melodies.He wrote several popular\nairs, one of them being \"Dixie,\" which afterward became the national\nair of the Confederate States.When \"Dixie\" was written Emmet was\nconnected with Bryant's Minstrels in New York city, and he sent a copy\nto his friend in St.Munger, and asked his opinion\nas to its merits and whether he thought it advisable to place it\nin the hands of a publisher.Munger assured his friend that he\nthought it would make a great hit, and he financially assisted Mr.One of the first copies printed\nwas sent to Mr.Munger, and the first time this celebrated composition\nwas ever sung in the West was in the music store of Munger Bros, in\nthe old concert hall building on Third street.\"Dixie\" at once became\nvery popular, and was soon on the program of every minstrel troupe in\nthe country.Dan Emmet devoted his whole life to minstrelsy and he\norganized the first traveling minstrel troupe in the United States,\nstarting from some point in Ohio in 1843.The father of the Emmets was a gallant soldier of the War of 1812, and\nat one time lived in the old brown frame house at the intersection of\nRamsey and West Seventh streets, recently demolished.A correspondent\nof one of the magazines gives the following account of how \"Dixie\"\nhappened to become the national air of the Confederate States:\n\n\"Early in the war a spectacular performance was being given in New\nOrleans.Every part had been filled, and all that was lacking was a\nmarch and war song for the grand chorus.A great many marches and\nsongs were tried, but none could be decided upon until 'Dixie' was\nsuggested and tried, and all were so enthusiastic over it that it\nwas at once adopted and given in the performance.It was taken up\nimmediately by the populace and was sung in the streets and in homes\nand concert halls daily.It was taken to the battlefields, and there\nbecame the great song of the South, and made many battles harder\nfor the Northerner, many easier for the Southerner.Though it has\nparticularly endeared itself to the South, the reunion of American\nhearts has made it a national song.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Lincoln ever regarded it as a\nnational property by capture.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hutchinson family often visited St.Paul, the enterprising town of\nHutchinson, McLeod county, being named after them.They were a very\npatriotic family and generally sang their own music.How deliberate\nthe leader of the tribe would announce the title of the song about to\nbe produced.Asa Hutchinson would stand up behind the melodeon,\nand with a pause between each word inform the audience that\n\"Sister--Abby--will--now--sing--the--beautiful--song--composed--\nby--Lucy--Larcum--entitled--'Hannah--Is--at--the--Window--Binding--\nShoes.'\"During the early\npart of the war the Hutchinson family was ordered out of the Army of\nthe Potomac by Gen.McClellan on account of the abolition sentiments\nexpressed in its songs.The general was apparently unable to interpret\nthe handwriting on the wall, as long before the war was ended the\nentire army was enthusiastically chanting that beautiful melody to the\nking of abolitionists--\n\n  \"John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave\n  And his soul is marching on.\"McClellan was at one time the idol of the army, as well as of the\nentire American people.Before the war he was chief engineer of the\nIllinois Central railroad and made frequent trips to St.McClellan, a Miss Marcy, daughter of Maj.Marcy\nof the regular army, who lived in the old Henry M. Rice homestead on\nSummit avenue.McClellan was in command of the Army of the\nPotomac Maj.One of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the\nfollowing dispatch, published since the above was written:\n\n\"Chicago, Ill., Jan.4, 1902.--John W. Hutchinson, the last survivor\nof the famous old concert-giving Hutchinson family, which\nwas especially prominent in anti-bellum times, received many\ncongratulations to-day on the occasion of his eighty-first birthday,\nMr.Hutchinson enjoys good health and is about to start on a new\nsinging and speaking crusade through the South, this time against the\nsale and us of cigarettes.Hutchinson made a few remarks to the\nfriends who had called upon him, in the course of which he said: 'I\nnever spent a more enjoyable birthday than this, except upon the\noccasion of my seventy-fifth, which I spent in New York and was\ntendered a reception by the American Temperance union, of which I was\nthe organizer.Of course you will want me to sing to you, and I\nthink I will sing my favorite song, which I wrote myself.It is \"The\nFatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man.\"I have written a great\nmany songs, among them \"The Blue and the Gray,\" \"Good old Days of\nYore,\" and some others that I cannot remember now.I sang the \"Blue\nand the Gray\" in Atlanta six years ago, at the time of the exposition\nthere, and McKinley was there.I had the pleasure of saying a few\nwords at that time about woman's suffrage.I wrote the first song\nabout woman's suffrage and called it \"Good Times for Women.\"This is\nthe 11,667th concert which I have taken part in.'\"The venerable singer is reputed to be quite wealthy.A few years ago\none of the children thought the old man was becoming entirely too\nliberal in the distribution of his wealth, and brought an action in\nthe New York courts requesting the appointment of a guardian to\nhis estate.The white-haired musician appeared in court without an\nattorney, and when the case was about to be disposed of made a request\nof the judge, which was granted, that he might be sworn.Hutchinson had made his statement to the court the judge asked a few\nquestions.\"I remember the flavor of the milk at the maternal fountain.\"Hutchinson was fully capable of managing\nhis own affairs.*       *       *       *       *\n\nConcert hall, built in 1857 by J.W.McClung, had room for 400 or 500\npeople, but it was somewhat inaccessible on account of its being in\nthe basement of the building and was not very much in demand.Horatio\nSeymour made a great speech to the Douglas wing of the Democracy in\nthe hall during the campaign of 1880, and Tom Marshall, the great\nKentucky orator, delivered a lecture on Napoleon to a large audience\nIn the same place.On the night of the presidential election in 1860 a\nnumber of musicians who had been practicing on \"Dixie\" and other music\nin Munger's music store came down to the hall and entertained the\nRepublicans who had gathered there for the purpose of hearing the\nelection returns.There was a great deal more singing than there was\nelection returns, as about all the news they were able to get was from\nthe four precincts of St.Paul, New Canada, Rose and Reserve townships\nand West St.We had a telegraph line, to be sure, but Mr.Winslow, who owned the line, would not permit the newspapers, or any\none else, to obtain the faintest hint of how the election had gone in\nother localities.After singing until 11 or 12 o'clock, and abusing\nMr.Winslow in language that the linotype is wholly unable to\nreproduce, the crowd dispersed.Nothing could be heard of how the\nelection

the effects of an over-indulgence of Kentucky's great\nstaple product, but the glorious climate of Minnesota did not seem to\nhave the desired effect, as he seldom appeared on the street without\npresenting the appearance of having discovered in the North Star State\nan elixer fully as invigorating as any produced in the land where\ncolonels, orators and moonshiners comprise the major portion of the\npopulation.One day as Marshall came sauntering down Third street he\nmet a club of Little Giants marching to a Democratic gathering.They thought they would have a little sport at the expense of the\ndistinguished orator from Kentucky, and they haulted immediately in\nfront of him and demanded a speech.Marshall was a\npronounced Whig and supported the candidacy of Bell and Everett, but\nas he was from a slave state they did not think he would say anything\nreflecting on the character of their cherished leader.Marshall\nstepped to the front of the sidewalk and held up his hand and said:\n\"Do you think Douglas will ever be president?He will not, as no man\nof his peculiar physique ever entered the sacred portals of the White\nHouse.\"He then proceeded to denounce Douglas and the Democratic party\nin language that was very edifying to the few Republicans who chanced\nto be present.The Little Giants concluded that it was not the proper\ncaper to select a casual passer-by for speaker, and were afterward\nmore particular in their choice of an orator.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOne night there was a Democratic meeting in the hall and after a\nnumber of speakers had been called upon for an address, De Witt C.\nCooley, who was a great wag, went around in the back part of the hall\nand called upon the unterrified to \"Holler for Cooley.\"Cooley's name was soon on the lips of nearly\nthe whole audience.Cooley mounted the platform an Irishman\nin the back part of the hall inquired in a voice loud enough to be\nheard by the entire audience, \"Is that Cooley?\"Upon being assured\nthat it was, he replied in a still louder voice: \"Be jabers, that's\nthe man that told me to holler for Cooley.\"The laugh was decidedly on\nCooley, and his attempted flight of oratory did not materialize.Cooley was at one time governor of the third house and if his message\nto that body could be reproduced it would make very interesting\nreading.*       *       *

the Athenaeum for the boys in blue.The cantata of \"The\nHaymakers,\" for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a\nhit, and old residents will recollect Mrs.Phil Roher and Otto\nDreher

Gough are among the great orators who have electrified and\ninstructed the older inhabitants, and the musical notes of the Black\nSwan, Mlle.Whiting and Madame Varian will ever be remembered by\nthose whose pleasure it was to listen to them.Scott Siddons, an\nelocutionist of great ability and a descendant of the famous English\nfamily of actors of that name, gave several dramatic readings to her\nnumerous admirers.Acker used\nthis hall as a rendezvous and drill hall for Company C, First regiment\nof Minnesota volunteers, and many rousing war meetings for the purpose\nof devising ways and means for the furtherance of enlistments took\nplace in this building.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.In February, 1861, the ladies of the different Protestant churches of\nSt.Paul, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, gave\na social and supper in this building for the purpose of raising funds\nfor the establishment of a library.It was a sort of dedicatory\nopening of the building and hall, and was attended by large\ndelegations from the different churches.A room was fitted up on the second story and the beginning\nof what is now the St.About 350 books were purchased with the funds raised by the social,\nand the patrons of the library were required to pay one dollar per\nyear for permission to read them.Simonton was the first\nlibrarian.Subsequently this library was consolidated with the St.Paul Mercantile Library association and the number of books more than\ndoubled.A regular librarian was then installed with the privilege of\nreading the library's books raised to two dollars per annum.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth\nand St.Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in\nthe city.H.

Mackubin erected two large\nbuildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel.Mozart hall was on\nthe Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner.At\na sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls\nwere thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was\nheld for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary\ncommission.Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the\nprincipal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword\nto the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the\nfront.A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities\non this plan, and the name of Col.Marshall of the Seventh regiment\nand Col.Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it\nwas thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a\nlarge vote.The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side\nhad some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number\nof votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close\nto carry off the prize.Uline had been a fireman and was very\npopular with the young men of the city.Marshall was backed by\nfriends in the different newspaper offices.The contest was very\nspirited and resulted in Col.Uline capturing the sword, he having\nreceived more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last\nfive minutes the polls were open.This fair was very successful,\nthe patriotic citizens of St.Paul having enriched the funds of the\nsanitary commission by several thousand dollars.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge\nSquare, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall.Whether it\nwas named for its agonizing music or the agonizing effects of its\nbeverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more\npomp and glory than any holiday during the year.The Pioneer Guards,\nthe City Guards, the St.Paul fire\ndepartment and numerous secret organizations would form in\nprocession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of\nrepresentatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the\nnation's first great hero would take place.Business was generally\nsuspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the\nfollowing day.In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St.She was\nabout sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company.They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river\ntowns.Their concert took place in the hall of the house of\nrepresentatives of the old capitol, that being the only available\nplace at the time.Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud\nby an incident that has never been printed.Two boys employed as\nmessengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business\nmen in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a\nnumber of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they\nwere frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of\nplaying cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations\nas it was possible for kids to conceive.After an hour or so of\nrevelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated.In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall\nand an alarm of fire was sounded.The door leading to the house was\nforced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned\nthrough the floor.The boys knew at once that it was their\ncarelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids\nnever got together.They could see visions of policemen, prison bars,\nand even Stillwater, day and night for many years.They would often\nget together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they\nhad yet been suspected.For more than a quarter of a century these two\nkids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts,\nand it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible\npredicament.*       *       *       *       *\n\nA few days after Maj.Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and\nStripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of\nparty, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives\nfor the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the\ndastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government.Long before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was\npacked and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of\nthe building in order that all who desired might take part in the\nproceedings.John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided,\nassisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents.John M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the\nprincipal speakers.Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for\ncongress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested\nto hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict.Gilman was in hearty sympathy with\nthe object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great\ndemonstrations of approbation.Gilman\nand made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr.There\nwere a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted\npledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling\non the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly\nforming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid\nwhen necessary to the dependant families of those left behind.Similar\nmeetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times\nbefore the Rebellion was subdued.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first Republican state convention after the state was admitted\ninto the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives.The state was not divided into congressional districts at that time\nand Col.Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for\nrepresentatives in congress.Aldrich did not pretend to be much\nof an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while\nhe was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his\nassociates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and\nhe promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to\npromote the success of the ticket.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built\nin 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of\nthe war.The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of\nthe social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by\nthe Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day.The Pioneer Guards\ndisbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members\nwere officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole\naway and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's\nstaff during the entire war.Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others\nfollowed as the war progressed.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St.Paul could boast of a\ngenuine opera house.The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street,\non the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished\nthat winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local\ntalent.The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at\nauction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who\npaid $72 for a seat in the parquet.This man Philbrick was a visitor\nin St.Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him.It\nwas whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and\nwhen he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people\nwere sure that he was at least a duke.He disappeared as mysteriously\nas he had appeared.It was learned afterward that this mysterious\nperson was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark.The first regular company to\noccupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily\nMelville as the chief attraction.This little theater could seat about\n1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long\nbefore the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed.Wendell\nPhilips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and\nmany others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old\nopera house.An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was\nin St.Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before\nthe lecture was to commence, and when Mr.Douglass commenced speaking\nthere was standing room only.A couple of enthusiastic Republicans\nfound standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in\nfront of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of\nW.H.Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in\nlocal Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous\nswing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to\ndo was to swing around with him.Consequently the Republicans who\nstood up behind Mr.Shelley thought they would have a little amusement\nat his expense.Douglass made a point worthy\nof applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great\ndemonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could\nonly see the huge outline of Mr.Shelley they concluded that he was\nthoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the\nRepublican fold.Shelley stood it until the lecture was about\nhalf over, when he left the opera house in disgust.Shelley was a\ncandidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St.Paul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson,\nbut as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked\nconfirmation.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England\na number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the\nAthenaeum.There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at\nthat time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as\npossible.James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the\nBenecia boy.They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all\nthe attendants necessary for properly staging the melee.It was\nprearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock\nHill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and\nHill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged\nplan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out.And Hill has kept\nright on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries,\nand is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty\nyears ago.PRINTERS AND EDITORS OF TERRITORIAL DAYS.SHELLEY THE PIONEER PRINTER OF MINNESOTA--A LARGE NUMBER OF\nPRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR--FEW OF.*       *       *       *       *\n\n  E.Y.Shelly,\n  George W.

McCoy, A.S.Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer\neditors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to\nthe attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed\nby this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of\npeople, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, \"the man behind\nthe gun,\" received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of\nour early history.In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in\nSt.Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few\nfonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the\nnew territory of Minnesota.Accompanying him were two young printers,\nnamed Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot\non the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the\ngreat Northwest.These two young men quickly tired of their isolation\nand returned to their former home.They were soon followed by another\nyoung man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains\nof far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his\ncountry's honor.Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa.,\non the 25th of September, 1827.When a mere lad he removed to\nPhiladelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on\nthe breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule\nand placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to\ntake part in the campaign against the Mexicans.He was assigned to\nthe Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of\nhostilities.On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered\nto report to Gen.Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras.Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across\nthe Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista\nfollowed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces\nwere successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third\ndragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special\nmention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position\nagainst the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the\nleadership of Santa Ana.Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa\nAna withdrew from Gen.Taylor's front and retreated toward the City\nof Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the\nAmerican forces under the command of Gen.Peace was declared in\n1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St.Louis, where they were mustered out of the service.Shelly took\npassage in a steamer for St.Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849,\nbeing the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota.The\nPioneer was the first paper printed in St.Paul, but the Register and\nChronicle soon followed.Shelly's first engagement was in the\noffice of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was\nemployed by Mr.Goodhue at the time of his tragic death.Shelly was connected\nwith that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat\nconsolidated.Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and\nwhen President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the\nold patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with\nMajor Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's\nbattalion.Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they\nwere mustered into service in September, 1861.They were ordered to\nreport at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known\nas Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry.In\nFebruary, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and\narrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and\nsurrender of Fort Donelson.Brackett's battalion was the only\nMinnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were\nnot in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and\nexhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen.Buckner from receiving\nreinforcements.After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual\nscout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and\nthe inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them.From Fort Donelson\nthree companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being\nCapt.Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen.Beauregard, who was only a short distance away.Brackett's company was\nsent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the\nroads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen.Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen.Buell to arrive at Pittsburg\nLanding just in time to save Gen.Shelly's company was engaged in\nprotecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth,\nMiss.On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the\nrebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief.This attack of the\nrebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February,\n1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort\nDonelson.They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their\ndead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt.Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in\nscouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes\non guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle.They\nwere frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept\nthemselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes.Opposed to\nthem were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry\nofficers in the Confederate service.A number of severe actions ended\nin the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a\nprominent part.After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept\non duty on the dividing line between the two forces.About the 1st\nof January, 1864, most of Capt.Shelly's company reinlisted and they\nreturned home on a thirty days' furlough.After receiving a number\nof recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864,\nreceived orders to report to Gen.Sully at Sioux City, who was\npreparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux.On\nthe 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march\nover the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana.It encountered the\nIndians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way.About the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and\nthe members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored\nregion.In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where\nthey went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since\nleaving Fort Snelling.Shelly was mustered out of the service in\nthe spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has\nbeen engaged at his old profession.Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many\nstirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it\ncould well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that\n\"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country,\nhe would not in his old age have forsaken him.\"Political preferment\nand self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye,\nwhile others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of\ntheir lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an\nungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.Henry C.

Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers.He\nwore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he\nalways appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than\nmost of his co-laborers.He was elected state treasurer on the\ndemocratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office\ndevoted his attention to the real estate business.Another old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M.\nCulver.Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect\nhow strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when\ntaking the third degree of that noble order.He is one of the best as well as\none of the best known printers in the Northwest.He has been printer,\nreporter, editor, publisher and type founder.Although he has been\nconstantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active\nand energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out\nthe century mark.Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and\ncleanest compositers among the territorial printers.He was employed\non the Minnesotian.Francis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the\nprinting business--printer, reporter, editor.He was a most estimable\nman, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to\nhis reward.The genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years\nfamiliar to most old-time residents.At one time he was foreman of the\nold St.He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids\nSentinel.Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard\nBradley.He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held\nthe same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years.Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled \"Who Stole Ben\nJohnson's Spaces.\"The late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St.Owens in the publication of the\nMinnesotian.For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St.Paul,\nand held several other positions of trust.Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum,\npublishers of the Daily Times.For several years after the war he was\nengaged as compositor in the St.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.Paul offices, and is now farming in\nNorthern Minnesota.Among the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet\nprinter by the name of Wentworth.He was called \"Long Haired\nWentworth.\"Early in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment.Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut.Wentworth\nwould not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was\nsummarly dismissed from the service.After being ordered out of the\nregiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary\nStanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other\npolitical prisoners.Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the\npublication of the first paper at Glencoe.At one time he was a\ncompositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state\nprinter for Nevada.Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat.He was a\nprinter-politician and possessed considerable ability.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.At one time he\nwas one of the editors of the Democrat.He was said to bear a striking\nresemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with\nany one without informing them of the fact.He was one of the original\nJacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar,\nwhich he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was\nchristened.No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume\non one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver\ndollar.He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that\nthe immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity.Another old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column\nwas J.Q.A.He was business manager\nof the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper.The first\nimmigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product\nof Jack's ingenuity.Jack created quite a sensation at one time by\nmarrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room\nacquaintance.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.He was a very bright man and should have been one of the\nforemost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was\nhis own worst enemy.Another Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack Barbour.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.His\ntheory was that in case the fiery king interfered with your business\nit was always better to give up the business.Carver was one of the best job printers in the country, and he\nwas also one of the best amateur actors among the fraternity.It was\nno uncommon thing for the old time printers to be actors and actors to\nbe printers.Lawrence Barrett, Stuart Robson and many other eminent\nactors were knights of the stick and rule.Frequently during the happy\ndistribution hour printers could be heard quoting from the dramatist\nand the poet, and occasionally the affairs of church and state would\nreceive serious consideration, and often the subject would be handled\nin a manner that would do credit to the theologian or the diplomat,\nbut modern ingenuity has made it probable that no more statesmen will\nreceive their diplomas from the composing room.Since the introduction\nof the iron printer all these pleasantries have passed away, and the\nsociability that once existed in the composing room will be known\nhereafter only to tradition.The late William Jebb was one of the readiest debaters in the old\nPioneer composing room.He was well posted on all topics and was\nalways ready to take either side of a question for the sake of\nargument.Possessing a command of language and fluency of speech that\nwould have been creditable to some of the foremost orators, he would\ntalk by the hour, and his occasional outbursts of eloquence often\nsurprised and always entertained the weary distributors.At one time\nJebb was reporter on the St.Raising blooded chickens\nwas one of his hobbies.One night some one entered his premises and\nappropriated, a number of his pet fowls.The next day the Times had a\nlong account of his misfortune, and at the conclusion of his article\nhe hurled the pope's bull of excommunication at the miscreant.It was\na fatal bull and was Mr.A fresh graduate from the case at one time wrote a scurrilous\nbiography of Washington.The editor of the paper on which he was\nemployed was compelled to make editorial apology for its unfortunate\nappearance.To make the matter more offensive the author on several\ndifferent occasions reproduced the article and credited its authorship\nto the editor who was compelled to apologize for it.In two different articles on nationalities by two different young\nprinter reporters, one referred to the Germans as \"the beer-guzzling\nDutch,\" and the other, speaking of the English said \"thank the Lord we\nhave but few of them in our midst,\" caused the writers to be promptly\nrelegated back to the case.Bishop Willoughby was a well-known character of the early times.A\nshort conversation with him would readily make patent the fact that he\nwasn't really a bishop.In an account of confirming a number of people\nat Christ church a very conscientious printer-reporter said \"Bishop\nWilloughby administered the rite of confirmation,\" when he should have\nsaid Bishop Whipple.He was so mortified at his unfortunate blunder\nthat he at once tendered his resignation.Editors and printers of territorial times were more closely affiliated\nthan they are to-day.Meager hotel accommodations and necessity for\neconomical habits compelled many of them to work and sleep in the same\nroom.Havens went on, \u201cwe employed the best\ndetective talent in America to discover his whereabouts and bring him\nback.The best detective talent in America failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the way they put it in stories!\u201d Carl cut in.\u201cWe spent over a hundred thousand dollars trying to bring the thief to\npunishment, and all we had to show for this expenditure at the end of\nthe year was a badly spelled letter written\u2014at least mailed\u2014on the lower\nEast Side in New York, conveying the information that Redfern was hiding\nsomewhere in the mountains of Peru.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you go!\u201d exclaimed Ben.\u201cThe last time we went out on a little\nexcursion through the atmosphere, we got mixed up with a New York murder\ncase, and also with Chinese smugglers, and now it seems that we\u2019ve got\nan embezzlement case to handle.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmbezzlement case looks good to me!\u201d shouted Jimmie.\u201cHiding in the mountains of Peru?\u201d repeated Sam.\u201cNow I wonder if a man\nhiding in the mountains of Peru has loyal friends or well-paid agents in\nthe city of Quito.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d exclaimed Mr.\u201cSam has hit the nail on the head the\nfirst crack.I never even told the boys when they left New York that\nthey were bound for Peru on a mission in which I was greatly interested.I thought that perhaps they would get along better and have a merrier\ntime if they were not loaded down with official business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have made any difference!\u201d announced Carl.\u201cWe\u2019d have\ngone right along having as much fun as if we were in our right minds!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I started away from the hangar in the _Ann_,\u201d Mr.Havens\ncontinued, with a smile at the interruption, \u201cI soon saw that some one\nin New York was interested in my remaining away from Peru.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedfern\u2019s friends of course!\u201d suggested Mellen.\u201cAnd Redfern\u2019s friends appeared on the scene last night, too,\u201d Jimmie\ndecided.\u201cAnd they managed to make quite a hit on their first\nappearance, too,\u201d he continued.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.\u201cAnd this man Doran is at present ready\nfor another engagement if you please.He\u2019s a foxy chap!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry he got away!\u201d Mellen observed.Havens agreed, \u201cbut, in any event, we couldn\u2019t\nhave kept him in prison here isolated from his friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one good thing about it,\u201d Ben observed, \u201cand that is that we\u2019ve\nalready set a trap to catch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d asked the millionaire.Mellen has employed a detective to follow Doran\u2019s companion on the\ntheory that sometime, somewhere, the two will get together again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very good idea!\u201d Mr.\u201cNow about this man Redfern,\u201d Mr.\u201cIs he believed to be\nstill in the mountains of Peru?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have at least one very good reason for supposing so,\u201d answered the\nmillionaire.\u201cYes, I think he is still there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive us the good reason!\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cI guess we want to know how\nto size things up as we go along!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very good reason is this,\u201d replied Mr.Havens with a smile, \u201cthe\nminute we started in our airships for the mountains of Peru, obstacles\nbegan to gather in our way.The friends or accomplices of Redfern began\nto flutter the instant we headed toward Peru.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat strikes me as being a good and sufficient reason for believing\nthat he is still there!\u201d Mellen commented.\u201cYes, I think it is!\u201d replied the millionaire.\u201cAnd it is an especially\ngood reason,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhen you understand that all our previous\nplans and schemes for Redfern\u2019s capture have never evoked the slightest\nresistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the embezzler is in Peru, all right, all right!\u201d laughed Carl.\u201cBut Peru is a very large country,\u201d suggested Mr.\u201cThere\u2019s a good deal of land in the country,\u201d agreed Jimmie.\u201cWhen you\ncome to measure the soil that stands up on end, I guess you\u2019d find Peru\nabout as large as the United States of America!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the prospects?\u201d asked Mellen.\u201cWhat I mean,\u201d he continued, \u201cis\nthis: Can you put your finger on any one spot on the map of Peru and\nsay\u2014look there first for Redfern.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Mr.Havens, \u201cI think I can.If you ask me to do it, I\u2019ll\njust cover Lake Titicaca with my thumb and tell you to pull Redfern out\nof the water as soon as you get to that part of old Incaland!\u201d\n\n\u201cJe-rusalem!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.\u201cAnd that takes us right down to the\nhaunted temple!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a lake is this Titicaca?\u201d asked Glenn.\u201cDon\u2019t you ever read anything except base-ball stories and police court\nrecords?\u201d asked Ben, turning to his friend.\u201cBefore I was seven years\nold I knew that Lake Titicaca is larger than Lake Erie; that it is five\ninches higher in the summer than in the winter, and that the longer you\nkeep a piece of iron or steel in it the brighter it will become.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a fact that the waters of this lake do not rust metal?\u201d asked\nMellen.\u201cThat seems to me to be a peculiar circumstance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have often heard it stated as a fact,\u201d replied Mr.\u201cAsk any one who knows, if you won\u2019t believe me,\u201d Ben went on with a\nprovoking smile.\u201cIt is said that Lake Titicaca represents the oldest\ncivilization in the world.There are temples built of stones larger than\nthose used in the pyramids of Egypt.The stones have remained in\nposition after a century because of the nicety with which they are\nfitted together.It is said to be impossible to drive the finest needle\nbetween the seams of the walls composed of granite rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what did they want to build such temples and fortresses for?\u201d\ndemanded Jimmie.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they spend more time playing base-ball?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nut on base-ball!\u201d laughed Ben.\u201cThe temples which exist to-day were there when the Incas settled the\ncountry,\u201d the boy continued.\u201cThey knew no more of their origin than we\ndo at this time!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may be a million years old!\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s as good a guess as any,\u201d replied Ben.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how\nold they are, and never shall know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little remarkable,\u201d said Mellen, \u201cthat an act of\nembezzlement committed in New York City more than two years ago should\nlead to a visit to ruined temples in Peru?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow about this Lake Titicaca, about which Ben has given us a bit of\nhistory,\u201d Mr.Havens said, after replying briefly to Mellen\u2019s question.\u201cWe have every reason to believe that Redfern has been living in some of\nthe ancient structures bordering the lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever try to unearth the East Side person who wrote the letter\nyou have just referred to?\u201d asked Ben.\u201cWe have spent thousands of dollars in quest of that person,\u201d replied\nthe millionaire, \u201cand all to no purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do we do to-morrow?\u201d asked Jimmie, breaking into the\nconversation in true boy-fashion.\u201cWhy, we\u2019re going to start for Peru!\u201d cried Carl.\u201cHonest, boys,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything in this haunted temple yarn.There may be\ntemples which are being guarded from the ravages of the superstitious by\ninterested persons who occasionally play the ghost, but so far as any\nsupernatural manifestations are concerned the idea is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever say anything like that in the vicinity of Lake\nTiticaca,\u201d Mellen suggested.\u201cIf you do, the natives will suddenly\ndiscover that you are robbers, bent on plunder, and some night, your\nbodies may find a resting-place at the bottom of the lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they really believe the temples to be haunted?\u201d asked Glenn.\u201cThere are people in whose interest the superstition is kept up,\u201d\nreplied Ben.\u201cThese interested people would doubtless gladly perform the\nstunt just suggested by Mellen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the combination now!\u201d Jimmie laughed.The temples still hold stores of gold, and those searching for\nthe treasure are keeping adventurous people away by making the ghost\nwalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea!\u201d Ben replied.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t this man Redfern have a\nchoice collection of ghosts of his own?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an idea, too,\u201d Mr.\u201cI\u2019ll bet he has!\u201d Jimmie insisted.\u201cThen we\u2019ll examine the homes of the ghosts first,\u201d grinned Jimmie.\u201cWe\u2019ll walk up to the portal and say: \u2018Mr.Ghost, if you\u2019ll materialize\nRedfern, we\u2019ll give you half of the reward offered for him by the trust\ncompany.\u2019 That ought to bring him, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s another idea,\u201d Sam interrupted.\u201cIf Redfern has ghosts in\nthe temple in which he is hiding\u2014if he really is hiding in a Peruvian\ntemple\u2014his ghosts will be the most active ghosts on the job.In other\nwords, we\u2019ll hear more about his haunted temple than any other haunted\ntemple in all Peru.His ghosts will be in a constant state of eruption!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s another good idea,\u201d suggested Mr.\u201cOh, Sam is wise all right,\u201d Jimmie went on.\u201cI knew that the minute he\ntold me about unearthing the provisions in the tent before he knew\nwhether the savages were coming back!\u201d\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d began Sam, with one of his smooth smiles, \u201cI was so hungry\nthat I didn\u2019t much care whether the savages came back or not.It\nappeared to me then that the last morsel of food that had passed my lips\nhad exhausted itself at a period farther away than the birth of Adam!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must have been good and hungry!\u201d laughed Mellen.\u201cWhat did you wander off into that country for?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cYou\nmight have known better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t remain in the Canal Zone,\u201d replied Sam, \u201cbecause no one\nwould give me a job.Everybody seemed to want to talk to me for my own\ngood.Even the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract told me\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract?\u201d asked\nHavens, casually.\u201cYou spoke of him a moment ago as if you had met him\npersonally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you see,\u201d Sam went on, hesitatingly, \u201cyou see I just happened\nto\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe confusion of the young man was so great that no further questions\nwere asked of him at that time, but all understood that he had\ninadvertently lifted a curtain which revealed previous acquaintance with\nmen like the chief in charge of the Gatun dam.The boy certainly was a\nmystery, and they all decided to learn the truth about him before\nparting company.Havens said, breaking a rather oppressive silence, \u201care we\nall ready for the roof of the world to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet we\u2019re all ready!\u201d cried Jimmie.\u201cWill you go with us, Sam?\u201d asked Mr.\u201cI should be glad to!\u201d was the reply.No more was said on the subject at that time, yet all saw by the\nexpression on the tramp\u2019s face how grateful he was for this new chance\nin life which Mr.\u201cJerusalem!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie in a moment, jumping to his feet and\nrushing toward the door.\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten something!\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething important?\u201d asked Ben.\u201cI forgot to eat my\ndinner, and I haven\u2019t had any supper yet!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you come to do it?\u201d asked Mellen.\u201cI didn\u2019t wake up!\u201d was the reply.\u201cAnd now,\u201d the boy went on, \u201cyou see\nI\u2019ve got to go and eat two meals all at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat one of them for you,\u201d suggested Sam.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll eat the other!\u201d volunteered Ben.\u201cI don\u2019t need any help when it comes to\nsupplying the region under my belt with provisions.\u201d\n\nThe boys hustled away to the dining-room, it being then about seven\no\u2019clock, while Mr.Havens and Mellen hastened back to the manager\u2019s\noffice.Passing through the public lobby, the manager entered his private room\nand opened a sheaf of telegrams lying on the table.He read it carefully, twice\nover, and then turned a startled face toward the manager.The manager glanced at the millionaire\u2019s startled face for a moment and\nthen asked, his voice showing sympathy rather than curiosity:\n\n\u201cUnpleasant news, Mr.Havens?\u201d\n\n\u201cDecidedly so!\u201d was the reply.The millionaire studied over the telegram for a moment and then laid it\ndown in front of the manager.The message was brief and ran as follows:\n\n  \u201cRalph Hubbard murdered last night!Private key to deposit box A\n  missing from his desk!\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept for the information that some one has been murdered,\u201d Mellen\nsaid, restoring the telegram to its owner, \u201cthis means little or nothing\nto me.I don\u2019t think I ever knew Ralph Hubbard!\u201d\n\n\u201cRalph Hubbard,\u201d replied the millionaire gravely, \u201cwas my private\nsecretary at the office of the Invincible Trust Company, New York.All\nthe papers and information collected concerning the search for Milo\nRedfern passed through his hands.In fact, the letter purporting to have\nbeen written and mailed on the lower East Side of New York was addressed\nto him personally, but in my care.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd deposit box A?\u201d asked Mellen.\u201cPardon me,\u201d he added in a moment, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t seek to pry into your private affairs, but the passing of the\ntelegram to me seemed to indicate a desire on your part to take me into\nyour confidence in this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeposit box A,\u201d replied the millionaire, \u201ccontained every particle of\ninformation we possess concerning the whereabouts of Milo Redfern.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see!\u201d replied Mellen.\u201cI see exactly why you consider the murder and\nrobbery so critically important at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not only lost my friend,\u201d Mr.Havens declared, \u201cbut it seems to\nme at this time that I have also lost all chance of bringing Redfern to\npunishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d consoled Mellen.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do now,\u201d the millionaire exclaimed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.\u201cWith the\ninformation contained in deposit box A in their possession, the\nassociates of Redfern may easily frustrate any move we may make in\nPeru.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it seems!\u201d mused Mellen.\u201cBut this man Redfern is still a person of\nconsiderable importance!Men who have passed out of the range of human\nactivities seldom have power to compel the murder of an enemy many\nhundreds of miles away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always believed,\u201d Mr.Havens continued, \u201cthat the money\nembezzled by Redfern was largely used in building up an institution\nwhich seeks to rival the Invincible Trust Company.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d the manager declared, \u201cthe whole power and influence of\nthis alleged rival would be directed toward the continued absence from\nNew York of Redfern.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d the millionaire answered.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.\u201cThen why not look in New York first?\u201d asked Mellen.\u201cUntil we started away on this trip,\u201d was the reply, \u201cwe had nothing to\nindicate that the real clew to the mystery lay in New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid deposit box A contain papers connecting Redfern\u2019s embezzlement with\nany of the officials of the new trust company?\u201d asked the manager.The manager gave a low whistle of amazement and turned to his own\ntelegrams.The millionaire sat brooding in his chair for a moment and\nthen left the room.At the door of the building, he met Sam Weller.Havens,\u201d the young man said, drawing the millionaire aside, \u201cI want\npermission to use one of your machines for a short time to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cGranted!\u201d replied Mr.\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d Sam continued, \u201cthat I can pick up valuable\ninformation between now and morning.I may have to make a long flight,\nand so I\u2019d like to take one of the boys with me if you do not object.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all want to go,\u201d suggested the millionaire.\u201cI know that,\u201d laughed Sam, \u201cand they\u2019ve been asleep all day, and will\nbe prowling around asking questions while I\u2019m getting ready to leave.I\ndon\u2019t exactly know how I\u2019m going to get rid of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich machine do you want?\u201d asked Mr.\u201cThe _Ann_, sir, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome to her,\u201d the millionaire returned.\u201cWell, then, with your permission,\u201d continued Sam, \u201cI\u2019ll smuggle Jimmie\nout to the field and we\u2019ll be on our way.The machine has plenty of\ngasoline on board, I take it, and is perfect in other ways?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe her to be in perfect condition, and well supplied with fuel,\u201d\nwas the answer.\u201cShe\u2019s the fastest machine in the world right now.\u201d\n\nSam started away, looking anything but a tramp in his new clothes, but\nturned back in a moment and faced his employer.\u201cIf we shouldn\u2019t be back by morning,\u201d he said, then, \u201cdon\u2019t do any\nworrying on our account.Start south in your machines and you\u2019ll be\ncertain to pick us up somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca.If you\ndon\u2019t pick us up within a day or two,\u201d the boy continued in a hesitating\ntone, \u201cyou\u2019ll find a letter addressed to yourself at the local\npost-office.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here, Sam,\u201d suggested Mr.Havens, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell me a little\nmore about yourself and your people?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometime, perhaps, but not now,\u201d was the reply.\u201cThe letter, you\nunderstand,\u201d he continued, \u201cis not to be opened until you have\nreasonable proof of my death.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand!\u201d the millionaire answered.\u201cBut here\u2019s another thing,\u201d he\nadded, \u201cyou say that we may find you between Quito and Lake Titicaca.Are you acquainted with that region?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I know something about it!\u201d replied Sam.\u201cYou see,\u201d he continued,\n\u201cwhen I left your employ in the disgraceful manner which will at once\noccur to you, I explained to Old Civilization that she might go and hang\nherself for all of me.I ducked into the wilderness, and since that time\nI\u2019ve spent many weeks along what is known as the roof of the world in\nPeru.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you luck in your undertaking!\u201d Mr.Havens said as the young man\nturned away, \u201cand the only advice I give you at parting is that you take\ngood care of yourself and Jimmie and enter upon no unnecessary risks!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good advice, too!\u201d smiled Sam, and the two parted with a warm\nclasp of the hands.After leaving the millionaire aviator at the telegraph office, Sam\nhastened to the hotel where the boys were quartered and called Jimmie\nout of the little group in Ben\u2019s room.They talked for some moments in\nthe corridor, and then Jimmie thrust his head in at the half-open door\nlong enough to announce that he was going out with Sam to view the city.The boys were all on their feet in an instant.Glenn was at the door ready for departure with the others.\u201cNo, no!\u201d said Sam shaking his head.\u201cJimmie and I are just going out\nfor a little stroll.Unfortunately I can take only one person besides\nmyself into some of the places where I am going.\u201d\n\nThe boys shut the door with a bang, leaving Carl on the outside.The lad\nturned the knob of the door and opened and closed it to give the\nimpression that he, too, had returned to the apartment.Then he moved\nsoftly down the corridor and, still keeping out of sight, followed Sam\nand Jimmie out in the direction of the field where the machines had been\nleft.The two conversed eagerly, sometimes excitedly during the walk, but of\ncourse, Carl could hear nothing of what was being said.There was quite\na crowd assembled around the machines, and so Carl had little difficulty\nin keeping out of sight as he stepped close to the _Ann_.After talking\nfor a moment or two with one of the officers in charge of the machines,\nSam and Jimmie leaped into the seats and pushed the starter.As they did so Jimmie felt a clutch at his shoulders, and then a light\nbody settled itself in the rather large seat beside him.\u201cYou thought you\u2019d get away, didn\u2019t you?\u201d grinned Carl.\u201cLook here!\u201d shouted Jimmie as the powerful machine swept across the\nfield and lifted into the air, \u201cyou can\u2019t go with us!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t?\u201d mocked Carl.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to put me\noff!You don\u2019t want to stop the machine now, of course!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, see here!\u201d insisted Jimmie, \u201cwe\u2019re going on a dangerous mission!We\u2019re likely to butt into all kinds of trouble.And, besides,\u201d he\ncontinued, \u201cSam has provisions for only two.You\u2019ll have to go hungry if\nyou travel with us.We\u2019ve only five or six meals with us!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re planning a long trip, eh?\u201d scoffed Carl.\u201cWhat will the boys\nsay about your running off in this style?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, keep still!\u201d replied Jimmie.\u201cWe\u2019re going off on a mission for Mr.You never should have butted in!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, let him go!\u201d laughed Sam, as the clamor of the motors gradually\nmade conversation impossible.\u201cPerhaps he\u2019ll freeze to death and drop\noff before long.I guess we\u2019ve got food enough!\u201d\n\nThere was no moon in the sky as yet, but the tropical stars looked down\nwith surprising brilliancy.The country below lay spread out like a\ngreat map.As the lights of Quito faded away in the distance, dark\nmountain gorges which looked like giant gashes in the face of mother\nearth, mountain cones which seemed to seek companionship with the stars\nthemselves, and fertile valleys green because of the presence of\nmountain streams, swept by sharply and with the rapidity of scenes in a\nmotion-picture house.As had been said, the _Ann_ had been constructed for the private use of\nthe millionaire aviator, and was considered by experts to be the\nstrongest and swiftest aeroplane in the world.On previous tests she had\nfrequently made as high as one hundred miles an hour on long trips.The\nmotion of the monster machine in the air was so stable that the\nmillionaire had often taken prizes for endurance which entitled him to\nmedals for uninterrupted flights.Jimmie declares to this day that the fastest express train which ever\ntraveled over the gradeless lines of mother earth had nothing whatever\non the flight of the _Ann_ that night!Although Sam kept the machine\ndown whenever possible, there were places where high altitudes were\nreached in crossing cone summits and mountain chains.At such times the temperature was so low that the boys shivered in their\nseat, and more than once Jimmie and Carl protested by signs and gestures\nagainst such high sailing.At two o\u2019clock when the moon rose, bringing every detail of the country\ninto bold relief, Sam circled over a green valley and finally brought\nthe aeroplane down to a rest hardly more than four thousand feet above\nsea-level.It was warm here, of course, and the two boys almost dropped\nfrom their seat as the fragrant air of the grass-grown valley reached\ntheir nostrils.While Sam busied himself with the running gear of the\nflying machine, Jimmie and Carl sprawled out on the lush grass and\ncompared notes.The moonlight struck the valley so as to illuminate its\nwestern rim while the eastern surface where the machine lay was still\nheavy in shadows.\u201cJiminy!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie, lifting himself on one elbow and gazing at\nthe wrinkled cones standing all around the valley.\u201cI wonder how Sam\never managed to drop into this cosy little nest without breaking all our\nnecks.\u201d\n\nSam, who seemed to be unaffected by the cold and the strain of the long\nflight, stood, oil-can in hand, when the question was asked.In a moment\nhe walked over to where the boys lay.\u201cI can tell you about that,\u201d he said with a smile.\u201cNot long ago I had a\njob running an old ice-wagon of an aeroplane over this country for a\nnaturalist.We passed this spot several times, and at last came back\nhere for a rest.Not to put too fine a point upon it, as Micawber would\nsay, we remained here so long that I became thoroughly acquainted with\nthe country.It is a lonesome little valley, but a pleasant one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what did we come here for?\u201d asked Carl, in a moment, \u201cand how far\nare we from Quito?Seems like a thousand miles!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are something like four hundred miles from the capital city of\nEcuador,\u201d Sam replied, \u201cand the reason why we landed here will be\ndisclosed when you chase yourselves along the valley and turn to the\nright around the first cliff and come face to face with the cunningest\nlittle lake you ever saw, also the haunted temple which stands there!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XII.\u201cI thought the haunted temples were a\nlot farther south.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are haunted temples all over Peru, if you leave it to the\nnatives,\u201d answered Sam.\u201cWhenever there is a reason for keeping\nstrangers away from such ruins as we are about to visit, the ghosts come\nforth at night in white robes and wave weird lights above skeleton\nfaces.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuit it!\u201d cried Carl.\u201cI\u2019ve got the creeps running up and down my back\nright now!Bring me my haunted temples by daylight!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d scorned Jimmie, \u201cwe\u2019ll bring you a little pet ghost in a\nsuit-case.That would be about your size!\u201d\n\n\u201cHonest,\u201d grinned the boy, \u201cI\u2019m scared half to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the specialty of the ghosts who inhabit this ruined temple?\u201d\nasked Jimmie.\u201cCan\u2019t you give us some idea of their antics?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I remember correctly,\u201d Sam replied, with a laugh, \u201cthe specialty of\nthe spirits to whom I am about to introduce you consists of low, soft\nmusic.How does that suit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you to quit it!\u201d cried Carl.\u201cAfter I prepare the aeroplane for another run,\u201d Sam went on, with a\ngrin, \u201cI\u2019ll take you around to the temple, if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother of Moses!\u201d cried Carl.\u201cMy hair\u2019s all on end now; and I won\u2019t\ndare look into a mirror in the morning for fear I\u2019ll find it turned\nwhite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strange feeling in my system, too!\u201d Jimmie declared, \u201cbut I\nthink it comes from a lack of sustenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmie,\u201d declared Carl reproachfully, \u201cI believe you would pick the\npocket of a wailing ghost of a ham sandwich, if he had such a thing\nabout him!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure I would!\u201d answered the boy.\u201cWhat would a ghost want of a ham\nsandwich?In those old days the people didn\u2019t eat pork anyway.If you\nread the history of those days, you\u2019ll find no mention of the wriggly\nlittle worms which come out of pigs and made trouble for the human\nrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re ready now,\u201d Sam broke in, \u201cwe\u2019ll take a walk around", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\u201cThere ain\u2019t no such animal, is there?\u201d asked Carl.\u201cI have never witnessed any \u2018supernatural\u2019 things,\u201d Sam answered, \u201cwhich\ncould not be traced eventually to some human agency.Usually to some\ninterested human agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d grinned Carl, \u201cif there ain\u2019t any ghosts at this ruined temple,\nwhat\u2019s the use of my going there to see them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may remain and watch the machine if you care to,\u201d Sam replied.\u201cWhile we are supposed to be in a valley rarely frequented by human\nkind, it may be just as well to leave some one on guard.For instance,\u201d\nthe young man went on, \u201ca jaguar might come along and eat up the\nmotors!\u201d\n\n\u201cJaguars?\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cAre they the leopard-like animals that chase\nwild horses off the pampas of Brazil, and devour men whenever they get\nparticularly hungry?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same!\u201d smiled Sam.\u201cThen I want to see the ghosts!\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know Carl right well,\u201d Jimmie explained, as they walked\nalong, \u201cyou\u2019d really think he\u2019d tremble at the sight of a ghost or a\nwild animal, but he\u2019s the most reckless little idiot in the whole bunch!He\u2019ll talk about being afraid, and then he\u2019ll go and do things that any\nboy in his right mind ought not to think of doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an idea that that was about the size of it!\u201d smiled Sam.Presently the party turned the angle of the cliff and came upon a placid\nlittle mountain lake which lay glistening under the moonlight.\u201cNow, where\u2019s your ruined temple?\u201d asked Carl.\u201cAt the southern end of the lake,\u201d was the reply.\u201cThere\u2019s a great white stone that might have\nformed part of a tower at one time, and below it is an opening which\nlooks like an entrance to the New York subway with the lights turned\noff.\u201d\n\nThe old temple at the head of the lake had frequently been visited by\nscientists and many descriptions of it had been written.It stood boldly\nout on a headland which extended into the clear waters, and had\nevidently at one time been surrounded by gardens.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything very mysterious about that!\u201d Carl remarked.\u201cIt\nlooks to me as if contractors had torn down a cheap old building in\norder to erect a skyscraper on the site, and then been pulled off the\njob.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait until you get to it!\u201d warned Jimmie.\u201cI\u2019m listening right now for the low, soft music!\u201d laughed Carl.\u201cDoes any one live there?\u201d asked Jimmie in a moment.\u201cAs the place is thought by the natives to be haunted,\u201d Sam answered,\n\u201cthe probability is that no one has set foot inside the place since the\nnaturalist and myself explored its ruined corridors several weeks ago.\u201d\n\nThe boys passed farther on toward the temple, and at last paused on the\nnorth side of a little arm of the lake which would necessitate a wide\ndetour to the right.From the spot where they stood, the walls of the temple glittered as if\nat sometime in the distant past they had been ornamented with designs in\nsilver and gold.The soft wind of the valley sighed through the openings\nmournfully, and it required no vigorous exercise of the imagination to\nturn the sounds into man-made music.\u201cCome on, Jimmie,\u201d Carl shouted.\u201cLet\u2019s go and get a front seat.The\nconcert is just about to begin!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no hurry!\u201d Jimmy answered.While the three stood viewing the scene, one which never passed from\ntheir memory, a tall, stately figure passed out of the entrance to the\nold temple and moved with dignified leisure toward the margin of the\nlake.\u201cNow, who\u2019s that?\u201d demanded Carl.\u201cThe names of the characters appear on the program in the order of their\nentrance!\u201d suggested Jimmie.\u201cHonest, boys,\u201d Sam whispered, \u201cI think you fellows deserve a medal\napiece.Instead of being awed and frightened, standing as you do in the\npresence of the old temple, and seeing, as you do, the mysterious figure\nmoving about, one would think you were occupying seats at a minstrel\nshow!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said yourself,\u201d insisted Jimmie, \u201cthat there wasn\u2019t any such thing\nas ghosts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of getting scared at\nsomething that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only question in my mind at the present time,\u201d Jimmie went on, with\na grin, \u201cis just this: Is that fellow over there carrying a gun?\u201d\n\nWhile the boys talked in whispers, Sam had been moving slowly to the\nwest so as to circle the little cove which separated him from the\ntemple.In a moment the boys saw him beckoning them to him and pointing toward\nthe ruins opposite.The figure which had been before observed was now standing close to the\nlip of the lake, waving his hands aloft, as if in adoration or\nsupplication.This posture lasted only a second and then the figure\ndisappeared as if by magic.There were the smooth waters of the lake with the ruined temple for a\nbackground.There were the moonbeams bringing every detail of the scene\ninto strong relief.Nothing had changed, except that the person who a\nmoment before had stood in full view had disappeared as if the earth had\nopened at his feet.\u201cNow what do you think of that?\u201d demanded Jimmie.\u201cSay,\u201d chuckled Carl, \u201cdo you think that fellow is custodian of the\ntemple, and has to do that stunt every night, the same as a watchman in\nNew York has to turn a key in a clock every hour?\u201d\n\nJimmie nudged his chum in the ribs in appreciation of the observation,\nand then stood silent, his eyes fixed on the broken tower across the\ncove.While he looked a red light burned for an instant at the apex of the old\ntower, and in an instant was followed by a blue light farther up on the\ncliff.\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d Carl insisted, in a moment.\u201cDo you\nthink they pull off this stunt here every night?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, keep still!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.\u201cThey don\u2019t have to pull it off\nevery night.They only put the play on when there\u2019s an audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn audience?\u201d repeated Carl.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.\u201cHow do they know they\u2019ve got an\naudience?\u201d\n\n\u201cChump!\u201d replied Jimmie scornfully.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.\u201cDo you think any one can sail an\naeroplane like the _Ann_ over this country without its being seen?Of\ncourse they know they\u2019ve got an audience.\u201d\n\nBy this time the boys had advanced to the place where Sam was standing.They found that young man very much interested in the proceedings, and\nalso very much inclined to silence.\u201cDid you see anything like that when you were here before?\u201d asked\nJimmie.\u201cDid they put the same kind of a show on for you?\u201d\n\nSam shook his head gravely.\u201cLet\u2019s chase around the cove and get those\nfront seats you spoke about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, boys!\u201d Sam started to say, but before the words were well out of\nhis mouth the two lads were running helter-skelter along the hard white\nbeach which circled the western side of the cove.\u201cCome back!\u201d he called to them softly.\u201cIt isn\u2019t safe.\u201d\n\nThe boys heard the words but paid no heed, so Sam followed swiftly on in\npursuit.He came up with them only after they had reached the very steps\nwhich had at some distant time formed an imposing entrance to a sacred\ntemple.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he demanded.I guess we\u2019ve got to see the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take any unnecessary risks!\u201d advised Sam.\u201cWhat\u2019d you bring us here for?\u201d asked Carl.\u201cLet\u2019s all go in together!\u201d\n\nSam hesitated, but the boys seized him by the arms and almost forced him\nalong.In a moment, however, he was as eager as the others.\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d asked Jimmie, as they paused for a moment on a\nbroad stone slab which lay before the portal of the ruined temple, \u201cthat\nyou went inside on your former visit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly did!\u201d was the reply.\u201cThen why are you backing up now?\u201d asked Carl.\u201cOn my previous visit,\u201d Sam explained, standing with his back against\nthe western wall of the entrance, \u201cthere were no such demonstrations as\nwe have seen to-night.Now think that over, kiddies, and tell me what it\nmeans.It\u2019s mighty puzzling to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ve got the answer to that!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.\u201cDid you come here\nin an aeroplane, or did you walk in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came in on an aeroplane, early in the morning,\u201d was the reply.\u201cThe people who are operating\nthese ghost stunts did not know you were coming because they saw no\nlights in the sky.Now we came down with a noise like an express train\nand a great big acetylene lamp burning full blast.Don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea!\u201d Carl cried.\u201cThe actors and stage hands all\ndisappeared as soon as you showed around the angle of the cliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why should they go through what you call their stunts at this time,\nand not on the occasion of my former visit?\u201d asked Sam.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d replied Jimmie wrinkling his freckled nose, \u201cthere\u2019s\nsome one who is interested in the case which called us to Peru doing\nthose stunts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Sam declared, \u201cthey have a definite reason for keeping\nus out of this particular ruin!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.\u201cSo far as we know, this man\nRedfern or some of his associates may be masquerading as ghosts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to this temple to-night,\u201d explained Sam, \u201cthinking that perhaps\nthis might be one of the way stations on the road to Lake Titicaca.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have guessed it!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.\u201cThe men who have been sent\nsouth to warn Redfern are doing their first stunts here!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Sam, \u201cmakes our position a dangerous one!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\u201cI wonder if they expect to scare us out of the country by such\ndemonstrations as that?\u201d scoffed Carl.\u201cThere is, doubtless, some reason for this demonstration,\u201d Sam observed,\nthoughtfully, \u201cother than the general motive to put us in terror of\nhaunted temples, but just now I can\u2019t see what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedfern may be hiding in there!\u201d suggested Jimmie, with a wink.Havens say that Redfern was in the\nvicinity of Lake Titicaca?How could he be here, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.Havens only said that Redfern was believed to be in the vicinity of\nLake Titicaca,\u201d Sam corrected.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.\u201cThen they don\u2019t even know where he is!\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cOf course they don\u2019t,\u201d laughed Sam.\u201cIf they did, they\u2019d go there and\nget him.That\u2019s an easy one to answer!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if Redfern isn\u2019t in that ruin,\u201d Jimmie declared, \u201cthen his own\nfriends don\u2019t know where he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it seems to me,\u201d Sam agreed, \u201cthat the men who are trying to reach\nhim are as much at sea as we are regarding his exact location.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jimmie declared, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be staging such plays\nas that on general principles!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cHere we stand talking as if we had positive\ninformation that the Redfern gang is putting on those stunts, while, as\na matter of fact, we don\u2019t know whether they are or not!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s a fact, too!\u201d said Jimmie.\u201cThe people in there may be\nignorant of the fact that a man named Redfern ever existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the chances are that the Redfern bunch is doing the work all the\nsame!\u201d insisted Sam.\u201cThe only way to find out is to go on in and see!\u201d declared Carl.\u201cWell, come on, then!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.The two boys darted in together, leaving Sam standing alone for an\ninstant.He saw the illumination thrown on the interior walls by their\nsearchlights and lost no time in following on after them.There was not even the sound of bird\u2019s\ncall or wing.The moonlight, filtering in through a break in what had\nonce been a granite roof, showed bare white walls with little heaps of\ndebris in the corners.\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d Sam said, as he looked around, \u201cthat the ghosts have\nchosen a very uncomfortable home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be other rooms,\u201d suggested Carl.\u201cThere are two which still retain the appearance of apartments as\noriginally constructed,\u201d replied Sam, \u201cone to the right, and one to the\nleft.There seems, also, to have been an extension at the rear, but that\nis merely a heap of hewn stones at this time.\u201d\n\nAs the young man ceased speaking the two boys darted through an opening\nin the west wall, swinging their flashlights about as they advanced into\nwhat seemed to be a stone-walled chamber of fair size.Following close\nbehind, Sam saw the lads directing the rays of their electrics upon a\nseries of bunks standing against the west wall.The sleeping places were\nwell provided with pillows and blankets, and seemed to have been very\nrecently occupied.Sam stepped closer and bent over one of the bunks.\u201cNow, what do you think about ghosts and ghost lights?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cThese ghosts,\u201d Carl cut in, \u201cseem to have a very good idea as to what\nconstitutes comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree beds!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie, flashing his light along the wall.\u201cAnd\nthat must mean three ghosts!\u201d\n\nSam proceeded to a corner of the room as yet uninvestigated and was not\nmuch surprised when the round eye of his electric revealed a rough\ntable, made of wooden planks, bearing dishes and remnants of food.He\ncalled at once to the boys and they gathered about him.\u201cAlso,\u201d Carl chuckled, \u201cthe three ghosts do not live entirely upon\nspiritual food.See there,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey\u2019ve had some kind of a\nstew, probably made out of game shot in the mountains.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ve been making baking powder biscuit, too!\u201d Carl added.\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it would be safe to sample that stew?\u201d Jimmie asked\nquestioningly.\u201cIt looks good enough to eat!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for me!\u201d declared Carl.While the boys were examining the table and passing comment on the\narticles it held, Sam moved softly to the doorway by which they had\nentered and looked out into the corridor.Looking from the interior out\nto the moonlit lake beyond, the place lost somewhat of the dreary\nappearance it had shown when viewed under the searchlights.The walls\nwere of white marble, as was the floor, and great slashes in the slabs\nshowed that at one time they had been profusely ornamented with designs\nin metal, probably in gold and silver.The moonlight, filtering through the broken roof, disclosed a depression\nin the floor in a back corner.This, Sam reasoned, had undoubtedly held\nthe waters of the fountain hundreds of years before.Directly across\nfrom the doorway in which he stood he saw another break in the wall.On a previous visit this opening, which had once been a doorway, had\nbeen entirely unobstructed.Now a wall of granite blocks lay in the\ninterior of the apartment, just inside the opening.It seemed to the\nyoung man from where he stood that there might still be means of\nentrance by passing between this newly-built wall and the inner surface\nof the chamber.Thinking that he would investigate the matter more fully in the future,\nSam turned back to where the boys were standing, still commenting on the\nprepared food lying on the table.As he turned back a low, heavy grumble\nagitated the air of the apartment.The boys turned quickly, and the three stood not far from the opening in\nlistening attitudes.The sound increased in volume as the moments\npassed.At first it seemed like the heavy vibrations of throat cords,\neither human or animal.Then it lifted into something like a shrill\nappeal, which resembled nothing so much as the scream of a woman in\ndeadly peril.Involuntarily the boys stepped closer to the corridor.\u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d whispered Jimmie.\u201cSome day,\u201d Jimmie suggested, in a graver tone than usual, \u201cyou\u2019ll be\npunished for your verbal treatment of ghosts!I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s\nanything on the face of the earth you won\u2019t make fun of.How do we know\nthat spirits don\u2019t come back to earth?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may, for all I know,\u201d replied Carl.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to decide the\nquestion, or to make light of it, either, but when I see the lot of\ncheap imitations like we\u2019ve been put against to-night, I just have to\nexpress my opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cheap imitations, all right!\u201d decided Jimmie.\u201cFlowing robes, and disappearing figures, and\nmysterious lights, and weird sounds!Why, a fellow couldn\u2019t work off\nsuch manifestations as we\u2019ve seen to-night on the most superstitious\nresidents of the lower West Side in the City of New York, and they\u2019ll\nstand for almost anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt strikes me,\u201d Sam, who had been listening to the conversation with an\namused smile, declared, \u201cthat the sounds we are listening to now may\nhardly be classified as wailing!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, listen,\u201d Carl suggested, \u201cand we\u2019ll see if we can analyze it.\u201d\n\nAt that moment the sound ceased.The place seemed more silent than before because of the sudden\ncessation.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t want to be analyzed!\u201d chuckled Carl.\u201cCome on,\u201d Jimmie urged, \u201clet\u2019s go and see what made it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll have to find out where it came from first!\u201d said Carl.\u201cIt came from the opening across the second apartment,\u201d explained Sam.\u201cI had little difficulty in locating it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look to me like much of an opening,\u201d argued Carl.\u201cThe stones you see,\u201d explained Sam, \u201care not laid in the entrance from\nside to side.They are built up back of the entrance, and my idea is\nthat there must be a passage-way between them and the interior walls of\nthe room.That wall, by the way, has been constructed since my previous\nvisit.So you see,\u201d he added, turning to Carl, \u201cthe ghosts in this neck\nof the woods build walls as well as make baking powder biscuits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a funny place to build a wall!\u201d Carl asserted.\u201cPerhaps the builders don\u2019t like the idea of their red and blue lights\nand ghostly apparatus being exposed to the gaze of the vulgar public,\u201d\nsuggested Jimmie.\u201cThat room is probably the apartment behind the scenes\nwhere the thunder comes from, and where some poor fellow of a supe is\nset to holding up the moon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t we go and find out about it?\u201d urged Carl.\u201cWait until I take a look on the outside,\u201d Sam requested.\u201cThe man in\nthe long white robe may be rising out of the lake by this time.I don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut that we have done a foolish thing in remaining\nhere as we have, leaving the aeroplane unguarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I\u2019d better run around the cliff and see if it\u2019s all right!\u201d\nsuggested Carl.\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sam argued, \u201cyou two remain here at the main entrance and I\u2019ll go\nand see about the machine.Perhaps,\u201d he warned, \u201cyou\u2019d better remain\nright here, and not attempt to investigate that closed apartment until I\nreturn.I shan\u2019t be gone very long.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d replied Jimmie, \u201cwe\u2019ll be good little boys and stand\nright here and wait for you to come back\u2014not!\u201d\n\nCarl chuckled as the two watched the young man disappear around the\nangle of the cliff.\u201cBefore he gets back,\u201d the boy said, \u201cwe\u2019ll know all about that room,\nwon\u2019t we?Say,\u201d he went on in a moment, \u201cI think this haunted temple\nbusiness is about the biggest fraud that was ever staged.If people only\nknew enough to spot an impostor when they saw one, there wouldn\u2019t be\nprisons enough in the world to hold the rascals.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell that to Sam to-night,\u201d laughed Jimmie.\u201cHe likes these\nmoralizing stunts.Are you going in right now?\u201d\n\nBy way of reply Carl stepped into the arch between the two walls and\nturned to the right into a passage barely more than a foot in width.Jimmie followed his example, but turned to the left.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.There the way was\nblocked by a granite boulder which reached from the floor to the roof\nitself.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.\u201cNothing doing here!\u201d he called back to Carl.\u201cI\u2019ve found the way!\u201d the latter answered.We\u2019ll be\nbehind the scenes in about a minute.\u201d\n\nThe passage was not more than a couple of yards in length and gave on an\nopen chamber which seemed, under the light of the electrics, to be\nsomewhat larger than the one where the conveniences of living had been\nfound.The faint illumination produced by the flashlights, of course\nrevealed only a small portion of it at a time.While the boys stood at the end of the narrow passage, studying the\ninterior as best they might under the circumstances, a sound which came\nlike the fall of a heavy footstep in the corridor outside reached their\nears.\u201cWe\u2019ll leave him at the entrance and go\nin.There\u2019s a strange smell here, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmells like a wild animal show!\u201d declared Jimmie.Other footsteps were now heard in the corridor, and Jimmie turned back\nto speak with Sam.\u201cThat\u2019s Sam all right enough!\u201d the latter exclaimed.\u201cDon\u2019t go away\nright now, anyhow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s doing?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cThere\u2019s a light back there!\u201d was the reply, \u201cand some one is moving\naround.Can\u2019t you hear the footsteps on the hard stone floor?\u201d\n\n\u201cMighty soft footsteps!\u201d suggested Jimmie.\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to know exactly what they are!\u201d declared Carl.\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you go on, then?\u201d demanded Jimmie.The two boys stepped forward, walking in the shaft of light proceeding\nfrom their electrics.Once entirely clear of the passage, they kept\nstraight ahead along the wall and turned the lights toward the center of\nthe apartment, which seemed darker and drearier than the one recently\nvisited.Besides the smell of mold and a confined atmosphere there was an odor\nwhich dimly brought back to the minds of the boys previous visits to the\nhomes of captive animals at the Central Park zoo.\u201cHere!\u201d cried Jimmie directly, \u201cthere\u2019s a door just closed behind us!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIV.When Sam Weller turned the corner of the cliff and looked out at the\nspot where the _Ann_ had been left, his first impression was that the\nmachine had been removed from the valley.He stood for a moment in uncertainty and then, regretting sincerely that\nhe had remained so long away, cautiously moved along, keeping as close\nas possible to the wall of the cliff.In a moment he saw the planes of\nthe _Ann_ glistening in the moonlight at least a hundred yards from the\nplace where she had been left.Realizing the presence of hostile interests, he walked on toward the\nplanes, hoping to be able to get within striking distance before being\ndiscovered.There was no one in sight in the immediate vicinity of the\n_Ann_, and yet she was certainly moving slowly over the ground.The inference the young man drew from this was that persons unfamiliar\nwith flying machines had invaded the valley during his absence.Not\nbeing able to get the machine into the air, they were, apparently, so\nfar as he could see, rolling it away on its rubber-tired wheels.The\nprogress was not rapid, but was directed toward a thicket which lay at\nthe west end of the valley.\u201cThat means,\u201d the young man mused, \u201cthat they\u2019re trying to steal the\nmachine!It is evident,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat they are apprehensive of\ndiscovery, for they manage to keep themselves out of sight.\u201d\n\nRealizing that it would be impossible for him to pass through the open\nmoonlight without being observed by those responsible for the erratic\nmotions of the _Ann_, the young man remained standing perfectly still in\na deep shadow against the face of the cliff.The _Ann_ moved on toward the thicket, and presently reached the shelter\nof trees growing there.In a moment she was entirely hidden from view.\u201cNow,\u201d thought Sam, \u201cthe people who have been kind enough to change the\nposition of the machine will doubtless show themselves in the\nmoonlight.\u201d\n\nIn this supposition he was not mistaken, for in a moment two men dressed\nin European garments emerged from the shadows of the grove and took\ntheir way across the valley, walking through the moonlight boldly and\nwith no pretense of concealment.Sam scrutinized the fellows carefully, but could not remember that he\nhad ever seen either of them before.They were dusky, supple chaps,\nevidently of Spanish descent.As they walked they talked together in\nEnglish, and occasionally pointed to the angle of the cliff around which\nthe young man had recently passed.A chattering of excited voices at the edge of the grove now called Sam\u2019s\nattention in that direction, and he saw at least half a dozen figures,\napparently those of native Indians, squatting on the ground at the very\nedge of the thicket.\u201cAnd now,\u201d mused Sam, as the men stopped not far away and entered into\nwhat seemed to him to be an excited argument, \u201cI\u2019d like to know how\nthese people learned of the revival of the hunt for Redfern!It isn\u2019t so\nvery many days since Havens\u2019 expedition was planned in New York, and\nthis valley is a good many hundred miles away from that merry old town.\u201d\n\nEntirely at a loss to account for the manner in which information of\nthis new phase of the search had reached a point in the wilds of Peru\nalmost as soon as the record-breaking aeroplane could have carried the\nnews, the young man gave up the problem for the time being and devoted\nhis entire attention to the two men in European dress.\u201cI tell you they are in the temple,\u201d one of the men said speaking in a\ncorrupt dialect of the English language which it is useless to attempt\nto reproduce.\u201cThey are in the temple at this minute!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too sure of that, Felix!\u201d the other said.\u201cAnd what is more,\u201d the man who had been called Felix went on, \u201cthey\nwill never leave the temple alive!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so fails the great expedition!\u201d chuckled the second speaker.\u201cWhen we are certain that what must be has actually taken place,\u201d Felix\nwent on, \u201cI\u2019ll hide the flying machine in a safer place, pay you as\nagreed, and make my way back to Quito.Does that satisfy you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be satisfied when I have the feeling of the gold of the\nGringoes!\u201d was the reply.Sam caught his breath sharply as he listened to the conversation.\u201cThere was some trap in the temple, then,\u201d he mused, \u201cdesigned to get us\nout of the way.I should have known that,\u201d he went on, bitterly, \u201cand\nshould never have left the boys alone there!\u201d\n\nThe two men advanced nearer to the angle of the cliff and seemed to be\nwaiting the approach of some one from the other side.\u201cWhy is he not here?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you trust him?\u201d he added, in a moment.\u201cWith my own life!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Gringoes are clever!\u201d warned Felix.There surely can be no mistake.\u201d\n\nThe men lapsed into silence and stood listening.Sam began to hope that\ntheir plans had indeed gone wrong.For a moment he was uncertain as to what he ought to do.He believed\nthat in the absence of the two leaders he might be able to get the _Ann_\ninto the air and so bring assistance to the boys.And yet, he could not\nput aside the impression that immediate assistance was the only sort\nwhich could ever be of any benefit to the two lads!\u201cIf they are in some trap in the temple,\u201d he soliloquized, \u201cthe thing to\ndo is to get to them as soon as possible, even if we do lose the\nmachine, which, after all, is not certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe flying machine,\u201d the man who had been called Felix was now heard to\nsay, \u201cis of great value.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.It would bring a fortune in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how are you to get it out of this district just at this time?\u201d\nasked the other.\u201cHow to get it out without discovery?\u201d\n\n\u201cFly it out!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you fly it out?\u201d asked the other in a sarcastic tone.\u201cThere are plenty who can!\u201d replied Felix, somewhat angrily.\u201cBut it is\nnot to be taken out at present,\u201d he went on.\u201cTo lift it in the air now\nwould be to notify every Gringo from Quito to Lima that the prize\nmachine of the New York Millionaire, having been stolen, is in this part\nof the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is very true,\u201d replied the other.\u201cHence, I have hidden it,\u201d Felix went on.\u201cAs safe as such people usually are!\u201d was the answer.As Sam Weller listened, his mind was busily considering one expedient\nafter another, plan after plan, which presented the least particle of\nhope for the release of the boys.From the conversation he had overheard\nhe understood that the machine would not be removed for a number of\ndays\u2014until, in fact, the hue and cry over its loss had died out.This, at least, lightened the difficulties to some extent.He could\ndevote his entire attention to the situation at the temple without\nthought of the valuable aeroplane, but how to get to the temple with\nthose two ruffians in the way!Only for the savage associates in the\nbackground, it is probable that he would have opened fire on the two\nschemers.That was a sufficient reason, to\nhis mind, to bring about decisive action on his part.However, the\nsavages were there, just at the edge of the forest, and an attack on the\ntwo leaders would undoubtedly bring them into action.Of course it was\nnot advisable for him to undertake a contest involving life and death\nwith such odds against him.The two men were still standing at the angle of the cliff.Only for the brilliant moonlight, Sam believed that he might elude their\nvigilance and so make his way to the temple.But there was not a cloud\nin the sky, and the illumination seemed to grow stronger every moment as\nthe moon passed over to the west.At last the very thing the young man had hoped for in vain took place.A\njumble of excited voices came from the thicket, and the men who were\nwatching turned instantly in that direction.As they looked, the sound\nof blows and cries of pain came from the jungle.\u201cThose brutes will be eating each other alive next!\u201d exclaimed Felix.\u201cI warned you!\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose you go back and see what\u2019s wrong?\u201d suggested Felix.\u201cI have no influence over the savages,\u201d was the reply, \u201cand besides, the\ntemple must be watched.\u201d\n\nWith an exclamation of anger Felix started away in the direction of the\nforest.It was evident that he had his work cut out for him there, for\nthe savages were fighting desperately, and his approach did not appear\nto terminate the engagement.The man left at the angle of the cliff to watch and wait for news from\nthe temple moved farther around the bend and stood leaning against the\ncliff, listening.The rattling of a\npebble betrayed the young man\u2019s presence, and his hands upon the throat\nof the other alone prevented an outcry which would have brought Felix,\nand perhaps several of the savages, to the scene.It was a desperate, wordless, almost noiseless, struggle that ensued.The young man\u2019s muscles, thanks to months of mountain exercise and\nfreedom from stimulants and narcotics, were hard as iron, while those of\nhis opponent seemed flabby and out of condition, doubtless because of\ntoo soft living in the immediate past.The contest, therefore, was not of long duration.Realizing that he was\nabout to lapse into unconsciousness, Sam\u2019s opponent threw out his hands\nin token of surrender.The young man deftly searched the fellow\u2019s person\nfor weapons and then drew him to his feet.\u201cNow,\u201d he said, presenting his automatic to the fellow\u2019s breast, \u201cif you\nutter a word or signal calculated to bring you help, that help will come\ntoo late, even if it is only one instant away.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.At the first sound or\nindication of resistance, I\u2019ll put half a clip of bullets through your\nheart!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the victory!\u201d exclaimed the other sullenly.\u201cMove along toward the temple!\u201d demanded Sam.\u201cIt is not for me to go there!\u201d was the reply.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll walk along behind you,\u201d Sam went on, \u201cand see that you have a\nballast of bullets if any treachery is attempted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is forbidden me to go to the temple to-night,\u201d the other answered,\n\u201cbut, under the circumstances, I go!\u201d\n\nFearful that Felix might return at any moment, or that the savages,\nenraged beyond control, might break away in the direction of the temple,\nSam pushed the fellow along as rapidly as possible, and the two soon\ncame to the great entrance of that which, centuries before, had been a\nsacred edifice.The fellow shuddered as he stepped into the musty\ninterior.\u201cIt is not for me to enter!\u201d he said.\u201cAnd now,\u201d Sam began, motioning his captive toward the chamber where the\nbunks and provisions had been discovered, \u201ctell me about this trap which\nwas set to-night for my chums.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nothing!\u201d was the answer.\u201cI overheard the conversation you had with\nFelix before the outbreak of the savages.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nothing!\u201d insisted the other.\u201cNow, let me tell you this,\u201d Sam said, flashing his automatic back and\nforth under the shaft of light which now fell almost directly upon the\ntwo, \u201cmy friends may be in deadly peril at this time.It may be that one\ninstant\u2019s hesitation on your part will bring them to death.\u201d\n\nThe fellow shrugged his shoulders impudently and threw out his hands.Sam saw that he was watching the great entrance carefully, and became\nsuspicious that some indication of the approach of Felix had been\nobserved.\u201cI have no time to waste in arguments,\u201d Sam went on excitedly.\u201cThe trap\nyou have set for my friends may be taking their lives at this moment.I\nwill give you thirty seconds in which to reveal to me their whereabouts,\nand to inform me as to the correct course to take in order to protect\nthem.\u201d\n\nThe fellow started back and fixed his eyes again on the entrance, and\nSam, following his example, saw something which sent the blood rushing\nto his heart.Outlined on the white stone was the shadow of a human being!Although not in sight, either an enemy or a friend was at hand!\u201cDoor?\u201d repeated Carl, in reply to his chum\u2019s exclamation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.\u201cThere\u2019s no\ndoor here!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there is!\u201d insisted Jimmie.\u201cI heard the rattle of iron against\ngranite only a moment ago!\u201d\n\nAs the boy spoke he turned his flashlight back to the narrow passage and\nthen, catching his chum by the arm, pointed with a hand which was not\naltogether steady to an iron grating which had swung or dropped from\nsome point", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "The bars of the gate, for it was little else, were not\nbrown and rusty but bright and apparently new.\u201cThat\u2019s a new feature of the establishment,\u201d Jimmie asserted.\u201cThat gate\nhasn\u2019t been long exposed to this damp air!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how long it hasn\u2019t been here!\u201d Carl said, rather crossly.\u201cWhat I want to know is how long is it going to remain there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it will let us out before dinner time,\u201d suggested Jimmie.\u201cAway, you and your appetite!\u201d exclaimed Carl.\u201cI suppose you think this\nis some sort of a joke.You make me tired!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the fact that we couldn\u2019t get out if we wanted to,\u201d Jimmie grinned,\n\u201cmakes me hungry!\u201d\n\n\u201cCut it out!\u201d cried Carl.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.\u201cThe thing for us to do now is to find some\nway of getting by that man-made obstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan-made is all right!\u201d agreed Jimmie.\u201cIt is perfectly clear, now,\nisn\u2019t it, that the supernatural had nothing to do with the\ndemonstrations we have seen here!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you understood that before!\u201d cried Carl, impatiently.Jimmie, who stood nearest to the gate, now laid a hand upon one of the\nupright bars and brought his whole strength to bear.The obstruction\nrattled slightly but remained firm.\u201cCan\u2019t move it!\u201d the boy said.\u201cWe may have to tear the wall down!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the man who swung the gate into position?\u201d questioned Carl.\u201cWhat\ndo you think he\u2019ll be doing while we\u2019re pulling down that heap of\nstones?You\u2019ve got to think of something better than that, my son!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jimmie said, hopefully, \u201cSam is on the outside, and he\u2019ll soon\nfind out that we\u2019ve been caught in a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pose as a prophet of evil, or anything like that,\u201d Carl\nwent on, \u201cbut it\u2019s just possible that he may have been caught in a trap,\ntoo.Anyway, it\u2019s up to us to go ahead and get out, if we can, without\nany reference to assistance from the outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead, then!\u201d Jimmie exclaimed.\u201cI\u2019m in with anything you propose!\u201d\n\nThe boys now exerted their united strength on the bars of the gate, but\nall to no purpose.So far as they could determine, the iron contrivance\nhad been dropped down from above into grooves in the stone-work on\neither side.The bars were an inch or more in thickness, and firmly\nenclosed in parallel beams of small size which crossed them at regular\nintervals.Seeing the condition of affairs, Jimmie suggested:\n\n\u201cPerhaps we can push it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything is worth trying!\u201d replied Carl.But the gate was too firmly in place to be moved, even a fraction of an\ninch, by their joint efforts.\u201cNow, see here,\u201d Jimmie said, after a short and almost painful silence,\n\u201cthere\u2019s no knowing how long we may be held in this confounded old\ndungeon.We\u2019ll need light as long as we\u2019re here, so I suggest that we\nuse only one flashlight at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will help some!\u201d answered Carl, extinguishing his electric.Jimmie threw his light along the walls of the chamber and over the\nfloor.There appeared to be no break of any kind in the white marble\nwhich shut in the apartment, except at one point in a distant corner,\nwhere a slab had been removed.\u201cPerhaps,\u201d suggested Carl, \u201cthe hole in the corner is exactly the thing\nwe\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt strikes me,\u201d said Jimmie, \u201cthat one of us saw a light in that corner\nnot long ago.I don\u2019t remember whether you called my attention to it, or\nwhether I saw it first, but I remember that we talked about a light in\nthe apartment as we looked in.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps we\u2019d better watch the hole a few minutes before moving over to\nit,\u201d suggested Carl.\u201cThe place it leads to may hold a group of savages,\nor a couple of renegades, sent on here to make trouble for casual\nvisitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cCasual visitors!\u201d repeated Jimmie.You know,\nand I know, that this stage was set for our personal benefit!How the\nRedfern bunch got the men in here so quickly, or how they got the\ninformation into this topsy-turvy old country, is another question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI presume you are right,\u201d Carl agreed.\u201cIn some particulars,\u201d the boy\nwent on, \u201cthis seems to me to be a situation somewhat similar to our\nexperiences in the California mountains.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight you are!\u201d cried Jimmie.The circle of light from the electric illuminated the corner where the\nbreak in the wall had been observed only faintly.Determined to discover\neverything possible regarding what might be an exit from the apartment,\nJimmie kept his light fixed steadily on that corner.In a couple of minutes Carl caught the boy by the arm and pointed along\nthe finger of light.\u201cHold it steadier now,\u201d he said.\u201cI saw a movement there just now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a movement?\u201d asked the other.\u201cLooked like a ball of fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be the cat!\u201d suggested Jimmie.\u201cQuit your foolishness!\u201d advised Carl impatiently.\u201cThis is a serious\nsituation, and there\u2019s no time for any grandstanding!\u201d\n\n\u201cA ball of fire!\u201d repeated Jimmie scornfully.\u201cWhat would a ball of fire\nbe doing there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would a blue ball of fire be doing on the roof?\u201d asked Carl,\nreprovingly.\u201cYet we saw one there, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nAlthough Jimmie was inclined to treat the situation as lightly as\npossible, he knew very well that the peril was considerable.Like a good\nmany other boys in a trying situation, he was usually inclined to keep\nhis unpleasant mental processes to himself.He now engaged in what\nseemed to Carl to be trivial conversation, yet the desperate situation\nwas no less firmly impressed upon his mind.The boys waited for some moments before speaking again, listening and\nwatching for the reappearance of the object which had attracted their\nattention.\u201cMove your light a little to the left.I\u2019m sure I saw a flash of color pass the opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw that too!\u201d Jimmie agreed.\u201cNow what do you think it can be?\u201d\n\nIn a moment there was no longer doubt regarding the presence at the\nopening which was being watched so closely.The deep vocal vibrations\nwhich had been noticed from the other chamber seemed to shake the very\nwall against which the boy stood.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.As before, it was followed in a moment\nby the piercing, lifting cry which on the first occasion had suggested\nthe appeal of a woman in agony or terror.The boys stood motionless, grasping each other by the hand, and so each\nseeking the sympathy and support of the other, until the weird sound\ndied out.\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Jimmie in a moment, \u201cis no ghost!\u201d\n\n\u201cGhost?\u201d repeated Carl scornfully.\u201cYou may as well talk about a ghost\nmaking that gate and setting it against us!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jimmie replied, \u201cthe wail left an odor of sulphur in the air!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Carl, \u201cand the sulphur you speak of is a sulphur which\ncomes from the dens of wild beasts!Now do you know what we\u2019re up\nagainst?\u201d\n\n\u201cMountain lions!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie.\u201cI hope they\u2019re locked in!\u201d suggested Jimmie.\u201cCan you see anything that looks like a grate before that opening?\u201d\nasked Carl.\u201cI\u2019m sure I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing doing in that direction!\u201d was the reply.At regular intervals, now, a great, lithe, crouching body could be seen\nmoving back and forth at the opening, and now and then a cat-like head\nwas pushed into the room!At such times the eyes of the animal, whatever\nit was, shone like balls of red fire in the reflection of the electric\nlight.Although naturally resourceful and courageous, the two boys\nactually abandoned hope of ever getting out of the place alive!\u201cI wonder how many wild animals there are in there?\u201d asked Carl in a\nmoment.\u201cIt seems to me that I have seen two separate figures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere may be a dozen for all we know,\u201d Jimmie returned.\u201cGee!\u201d he\nexclaimed, reverting to his habit of concealing serious thoughts by\nlightly spoken words, \u201cDaniel in the lion\u2019s den had nothing on us!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many shots have you in your automatic?\u201d asked Carl, drawing his own\nfrom his pocket.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do some shooting, probably.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I have a full clip of cartridges,\u201d Jimmie answered.\u201cWhy, surely, I have!\u201d returned Jimmie.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember we filled\nour guns night before last and never\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought so!\u201d exclaimed Carl, ruefully.\u201cWe put in fresh clips night\nbefore last, and exploded eight or nine cartridges apiece on the return\ntrip to Quito.Now, how many bullets do you think you have available?One or two?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d replied Jimmie, and there was almost a sob in his voice\nas he spoke.\u201cI presume I have only one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the electric light may keep the brutes away,\u201d said Carl\nhopefully.\u201cYou know wild animals are afraid of fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it may,\u201d replied Jimmie, \u201cbut it strikes me that our little\ntorches will soon become insufficient protectors.Those are jaguars out\nthere, I suppose you know.And they creep up to camp-fires and steal\nsavage children almost out of their mothers\u2019 arms!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you suppose Sam is by this time?\u201d asked Carl, in a moment, as\nthe cat-like head appeared for the fourth or fifth time at the opening.\u201cI\u2019m afraid Sam couldn\u2019t get in here in time to do us any good even if\nhe stood in the corridor outside!\u201d was the reply.\u201cWhatever is done,\nwe\u2019ve got to do ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that brings us down to a case of shooting!\u201d Carl declared.\u201cIt\u2019s only a question of time,\u201d Jimmie went on, \u201cwhen the jaguars will\nbecome hungry enough to attack us.When they get into the opening, full\nunder the light of the electric, we\u2019ll shoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold the light,\u201d Carl argued, \u201cand you do the shooting.You\u2019re a\nbetter marksman than I am, you know!When your last cartridge is gone,\nI\u2019ll hand you my gun and you can empty that.If there\u2019s only two animals\nand you are lucky with your aim, we may escape with our lives so far as\nthis one danger is concerned.How we are to make our escape after that\nis another matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there are more than two jaguars,\u201d Jimmie answered, \u201cor if I\u2019m\nunlucky enough to injure one without inflicting a fatal wound, it will\nbe good-bye to the good old flying machines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it!\u201d Carl agreed.All this conversation had occurred, of course, at intervals, whenever\nthe boys found the heart to put their hopes and plans into words.It\nseemed to them that they had already spent hours in the desperate\nsituation in which they found themselves.The periods of silence,\nhowever, had been briefer than they thought, and the time between the\ndeparture of Sam and that moment was not much more than half an hour.\u201cThere are two heads now!\u201d Jimmie said, after a time, \u201cand they\u2019re\ncoming out!Hold your light steady when they reach the center of the\nroom.I can\u2019t afford to miss my aim.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs your arm steady?\u201d almost whispered Carl.Four powerful, hungry, jaguars, instead of two, crept out of the\nopening!Jimmie tried to cheer his companion with the whispered hope\nthat there might possibly be bullets enough for them all, and raised his\nweapon.Two shots came in quick succession, and two jaguars crumpled\ndown on the floor.Nothing daunted, the other brutes came on, and Jimmie\nseized Carl\u2019s automatic.The only question now was this:\n\nHow many bullets did the gun hold?As Sam watched the shadow cast by the moonlight on the marble slab at\nthe entrance, his prisoner turned sharply about and lifted a hand as if\nto shield himself from attack.\u201cA savage!\u201d he exclaimed in a terrified whisper.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.It seemed to Sam Weller at that moment that no word had ever sounded\nmore musically in his ears.The expression told him that a third element\nhad entered into the situation.He believed from recent experiences that\nthe savages who had been seen at the edge of the forest were not exactly\nfriendly to the two white men.Whether or not they would come to his\nassistance was an open question, but at least there was a chance of\ntheir creating a diversion in his favor.\u201cHow do you know the shadow is that of a savage?\u201d asked Sam.The prisoner pointed to the wide doorway and crowded back behind his\ncaptor.There, plainly revealed in the moonlight, were the figures of\ntwo brawny native Indians!Felix was approaching the entrance with a\nconfident step, and the two watchers saw him stop for an instant and\naddress a few words to one of the Indians.The next moment the smile on\nthe fellow\u2019s face shifted to a set expression of terror.Before he could utter another word, he received a blow on the head which\nstretched him senseless on the smooth marble.Then a succession of\nthreatening cries came from the angle of the cliff, and half a dozen\nIndians swarmed up to where the unconscious man lay!The prisoner now crouched behind his captor, his body trembling with\nfear, his lips uttering almost incoherent appeals for protection.The savages glanced curiously into the temple for a moment and drew\ntheir spears and bludgeons.Sam turned his eyes away with a shudder.He\nheard blows and low hisses of enmity, but there came no outcry.When he looked again the moonlight showed a dark splotch on the white\nmarble, and that alone!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.\u201cMother of Mercy!\u201d shouted the prisoner in a faltering tone.\u201cWhere did they take him?\u201d asked Sam.The prisoner shuddered and made no reply.The mute answer, however, was\nsufficient.The young man understood that Felix had been murdered by the\nsavages within sound of his voice.\u201cBecause,\u201d was the hesitating answer, \u201cthey believe that only evil\nspirits come out of the sky in the night-time.\u201d\n\nSam remembered of his own arrival and that of his friends, and\ncongratulated himself and them that the savages had not been present to\nwitness the event.\u201cAnd they think he came in the machine?\u201d asked Sam.The prisoner shuddered and covered his face with his hands.\u201cAnd now,\u201d demanded Sam, \u201cin order to save your own life, will you tell\nme what I want to know?\u201d\n\nThe old sullen look returned to the eyes of the captive.Perhaps he was\nthinking of the great reward he might yet receive from his distant\nemployers if he could escape and satisfy them that the boys had perished\nin the trap set for them.At any rate he refused to answer at that time.In fact his hesitation was a brief one, for while Sam waited, a finger\nupon the trigger of his automatic, two shots came from the direction of\nthe chamber across the corridor, and the acrid smell of gunpowder came\nto his nostrils.It was undoubtedly his belief\nat that time that all his hopes of making a favorable report to his\nemployers had vanished.The shots, he understood, indicated resistance;\nperhaps successful resistance.\u201cYes,\u201d he said hurriedly, his knees almost giving way under the weight\nof his shaking body.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell you where your friends are.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated and pointed toward the opposite entrance.\u201cFelix caused them to be thrown to the beasts!\u201d\n\nThe young man seized the prisoner fiercely by the throat.The captive still pointed to the masked entrance across the corridor and\nSam drew him along, almost by main force.When they came to the narrow\npassage at the eastern end of which the barred gate stood, they saw a\nfinger of light directed into the interior of the apartment.While they looked, Sam scarcely knowing what course to pursue, two more\nshots sounded from within, and the odor of burned powder became almost\nunbearable.Sam threw himself against the iron gate and shouted out:\n\n\u201cJimmie!Carl!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried a voice out of the smoke.I missed the last shot, and Carl is down!\u201d\n\nStill pushing the prisoner ahead of him, Sam crowded through the narrow\npassage and stood looking over the fellow\u2019s shoulder into the\nsmoke-scented room beyond.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.His electric light showed Jimmie standing\nwith his back against the gate, his feet pushed out to protect the\nfigure of Carl, lying on the floor against the bars.The searchlight in\nthe boy\u2019s hand was waving rhythmically in the direction of a pair of\ngleaming eyes which looked out of the darkness.\u201cMy gun is empty!\u201d Jimmie almost whispered.\u201cI\u2019ll hold the light\nstraight in his eyes, and you shoot through the bars.\u201d\n\nSam forced the captive down on the corridor, where he would be out of\nthe way and still secure from escape, and fired two shots at the\nblood-mad eyes inside.The great beast fell to the floor instantly and\nlay still for a small fraction of a second then leaped to his feet\nagain.\"You must take care, honey,\"\nhe said, lowering his voice.\"They suspect me now of communicating with\nthe Governor and McCulloch.Jinny, it's all very well to be brave, and\nto stand by your colors.But this sort of thing,\" said he, stroking the\ngown, \"this sort of thing doesn't help the South, my dear, and only\nsets spies upon us.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the kitchen.Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes\nstanding in the alley last night for three hours.\"\"Pa,\" cried the girl, \"I'm so sorry.\"Suddenly searching his face with\na swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and\nlined.\"Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must\nnot go off on any more trips.\"\"It isn't the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant\nduties--Jinny--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"The Colonel's eye had suddenly fallen on Mr.Hopper, who was still\nstanding at the bottom of the steps.He checked himself abruptly as\nEliphalet pulled off his hat,\n\n\"Howdy, Colonel?\"Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen\nby a presentiment.As she saw her father start down the steps, she\nyearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she\nknew not what.Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly\nas ever.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor.\"Won't--won't you come in, Mr.Virginia started\n\n\"I don't know but what I will, thank you, Colonel,\" he answered; easily.\"I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter.\"Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs.Gaining her room,\nshe shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her\nthere.The man's face had all at once become a terror.She threw herself\non the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still\nleering at her with a new confidence.Presently she grew calmer; rising,\nshe put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the\nstairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her.She had never been in\nfear of a man before.She hearkened over the banisters for his voice,\nheard it, and summoned all her courage.How cowardly she had been to\nleave her father alone with him.Colfax\nignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at\nthat lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory.It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed\nwhat it cost her.Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner,\nand gloated over that likewise.Not a turn or a quiver of the victim's\npain is missed by your beast of prey.The Colonel was gravely polite,\nbut preoccupied.Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a\nguest.Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would\nhave given it to a governor.\"Thank'ee, Colonel, I don't smoke,\" he said, waving the bog away.Colfax flung herself out of the room.It was ten o'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his\nway up the front steps where the boarders were gathered.\"The war doesn't seem to make any difference in your business, Mr.Hopper,\" his landlady remarked, \"where have you been so late?\"\"I happened round at Colonel Carvel's this afternoon, and stayed for tea\nwith 'em,\" he answered, striving to speak casually.Abner Reed's room later than usual that\nnight.THE SCOURGE OF WAR\n\n\"Virginia,\" said Mrs.Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, \"I\nam going back to Bellegarde today.I really cannot put up with such a\nperson as Comyn had here to tea last night.\"It is safe to say that she had never accurately\ngauged the force which Virginia's respect for her elders, and affection\nfor her aunt through Clarence, held in check.Now there had arisen in front of her a tall\nperson of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively.It was not\nwhat Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade.Colfax sank\ninto a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had\nthrust into her hand.\"There has been a battle at Wilson's Creek,\" said Virginia, in an\nemotionless voice.\"General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we\nshould be thankful.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their\nway here.They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from\nSpringfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to\neat or drink.\"\"At what time shall I order the carriage\nto take you to Bellegarde?\"Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece's gown.\"Oh,\nlet me stay,\" she cried, \"let me stay.\"As you please, Aunt Lillian,\" she answered.\"You know that you may\nalways stay here.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.I only beg of you one thing, that when you have\nanything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it\nbefore Pa.\"Oh, Jinny,\" sobbed the lady, in tears again, \"how can you be so cruel\nat such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?\"But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for\nColonel Carvel's house.All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and\nAunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which\nshe had long denied herself.At evening she went to the station at\nFourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed\nback by the soldiers, until the trains came in.Alas, the heavy basket\nwhich the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again.The first\nhundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were\nlaid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the\nnew House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have\ntheir hearts wrung.The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun\nreeked with white wash and paint.The miserable men lay on the hard\nfloor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle.Those were\nthe first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to\nappal us.Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed\non the field weeks before.Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she\ndeclared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an\nordeal.Carvel had to assist her to the\nwaiting-room.Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia\nbusy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price's army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed\neyes were following her every motion.His frontiersman's clothes,\nstained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body.At\nVirginia's bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh\nwater, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands.Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man's wound, and to prescribe\nsome of the broth from Virginia's basket.For the first time since the\nwar began something of happiness entered her breast.Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the\nquestions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged\nthe place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to\nwork in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have\nbeen seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down\nthe names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night\nwriting to them.They put a mattress under the Arkansan.Virginia did not leave him until\nhe had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken\nface.Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that\nrose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to\njoin her father and aunt in the carriage below.She felt that another little while\nin this heated, horrible place would drive her mad.She was almost at\nthe door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.An elderly lady in widow's black was kneeling beside a man groaning in\nmortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face.He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn.A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right\nband.Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity,\nthrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there.Her face the\ngirl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man.The sweetness of\nher voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning\nthat he might listen:\n\n\"You have a wife?\"\"A boy, ma'am--born the week--before I came--away.\"\"I shall write to your wife,\" said the lady, so gently that Virginia\ncould scarce hear, \"and tell her that you are cared for.He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota.Then he\nadded, \"God bless you, lady.\"Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them.The lady turned\nher face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes.Virginia felt them\nwet in her own.Nobility, character,\nefficiency,-all were written on that face.Nobility spoke in the large\nfeatures, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes.Virginia had\nseen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her.\"Doctor, could this man's life be saved if I took him to my home?\"The surgeon got down beside her and took the man's pulse.For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head.The surgeon\nsmiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of\namputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand,\na clear eye and brain, and a good heart.Brice,\" he said, \"I shall be glad to get you permission\nto take him, but we must first make him worth the taking.He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and\nthen added, \"We must have one more to help us.\"\"I am afraid we must go, dear,\" he said, \"your aunt is getting\nimpatient.\"\"Won't you please go without me, Pa?\"\"Perhaps I can be of\nsome use.\"The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went\naway.The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of\nastonishment.Brice's searching gaze that brought the color\nto the girl's, face.\"Thank you, my dear,\" she said simply.As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the\ncarriage, Colonel Carvel came back.For two reeking hours he stood\nagainst the newly plastered wall.Even he was surprised at the fortitude\nand skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly\ncut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough\nbandages.At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary\nsurgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to\nhim, his thanks to the two ladies.The work of her hands had sustained\nher while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.She went down the\nstairs on her father's arm, and out into the air.Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.she was saying, \"God will reward you for this act.You have\ntaught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles.\"Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing.The\nmere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was\nfilled with a longing unutterable.It was not because Margaret Brice\nwas the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with\nhers--whom she saw in her dreams.And yet now some of Stephen's traits\nseemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation.Virginia had\nlabored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice's side doing His\nwork, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters.One brief\nsecond had been needful for the spell.The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished\nhim, and Mrs.Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and\nwatch by the sergeant's pallet.Virginia's eyes followed her up the\nstairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage.With\nher foot on the step Virginia paused.\"Pa,\" she said, \"do you think it would be possible to get them to let us\ntake that Arkansan into our house?\"\"Why, honey, I'll ask Brinsmade if you like,\" said the Colonel.\"Here he\ncomes now, and Anne.\"It was Virginia who put the question to him.\"My dear,\" replied that gentleman, patting her, \"I would do anything\nin the world for you.I'll see General Fremont this very afternoon.Virginia,\" he added, soberly, \"it is such acts as yours to-day that give\nus courage to live in these times.\"\"Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men.It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on\nthe face of the commanding general when Mr.Brinsmade at length got to\nhim with her request.This was before the days when the wounded arrived\nby the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to\nthrow out of gear the workings of a great system.But the General, had\nhad his eye on Mr.Brinsmade, with dignity, \"is a gentleman.When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.\"\"Even to an enemy,\" the General put in, \"By George, Brinsmade, unless I\nknew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself.Well, well,\nhe may have his Arkansan.\"Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not\nsay that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview\nhis Excellency, the Commander in-chief.It was like obtaining an\naudience with the Sultan or the Czar.Citizens who had been prominent\nin affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men\nlike Mr.Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows\nin one of the general's anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with\nbeardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain.The\nGeneral might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough.His European notions\nof uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter.He was\na royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a\nglittering guard.It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that\nthese simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of\nthing.That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less\nin communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all\ntheir lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two\nhours to mop their brows.On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette,\nyou discovered a good man and a patriot.It was far from being the\nGeneral's fault that Mr.Hopper and others made money in mules and\nworthless army blankets.Such things always have been, and always will\nbe unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep\nof security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword.We\nshall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army\nof comfortable size will save millions in the end.So much for Democracy\nwhen it becomes a catchword.The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the\nWestern Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women\nwho gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing.Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with\ntruth its doings.The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler\nhero than he was never under a man's hand.For the glory of generals\nfades beside his glory.Brice home from\nher trying day in the hospital.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Stephen, just returned from drill\nat Verandah hall, met her at the door.She would not listen to his\nentreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the\nporch behind the house, where there was a little breeze.\"Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen,\" she said.\"It was\nwhile we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost\nhis arm.I hope we shall be allowed to have him here.\"It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow,\" she said.\"I saw\nthe--the flies around him.And as I got down beside him to fan them away\nI had such a queer sensation.I knew that some one was standing behind\nme, looking at me.Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the\nman, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get\nhelp.Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice.It was that Miss\nCarvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you\nbought Hester, and to whose party you once went.Do you remember that\nthey offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?\"", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "\"She is a wonderful creature,\" his mother continued.And wasn't it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to\nmake?They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them.\"The good\nlady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making.And, my dear, her\ncapability astonished me.One might have thought that she had always\nbeen a nurse.The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must\nit have been for her.After the operation was over, I followed her\ndownstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the\nbuilding, waiting for their carriage.I felt that I must say something\nto her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done.When I\nsaw her there, I scarcely knew what to say.It was then three o'clock, and she had been working steadily in that\nplace since morning.I am sure she could not have borne it much longer.Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so\nwhen I took it, and she was very pale.Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such\npoliteness.He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked,\nand he brought a mattress for us.I have heard that his house is\nwatched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating\nwith the Confederate leaders.\"I hope they will not get into any trouble.\"It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the\nIron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards\ndrawn up.On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen\ncaught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their\ncountrymen.Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands.The tears ran\non his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.Judge Whipple, grim\nand silent, stood apart.But he uncovered his head with the others when\nthe train rolled in.Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes\nwere piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of\nCaptain Carl Richter.Far from the land of his birth, among those same oaks on Bloody Hill\nwhere brave Lyon fell, he had gladly given up his life for the new\ncountry and the new cause he had made his own.That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a\nhero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the\ngreat trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the\nbugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent,\nstepped out from behind the blue line of the troops.He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first\nof many to be laid on Richter's grave.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.And yet he had not filled it\nwith sadness.For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look\nupon his empty place without a pang.He missed the cheery songs and the\nearnest presence even more than he had thought.Carl Richter,--as his\nfather before him,--had lived for others.Both had sacrificed their\nbodies for a cause.One of them might be pictured as he trudged with\nFather Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering\nat sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr's ranks to drive the tyrant\nNapoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time,\nhis wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a\nthankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena.Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder\nman left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar.In\nCarl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred.Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate\nthat great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the\noppressed.THE LIST OF SIXTY\n\nOne chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black\nmud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window.Her eye was\ncaught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched\nover them.One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame.They were\npulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel.On the seat a\nman, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his\nfeeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a\nragged blanket.In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed\ndown in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware,\nlay a gaunt woman in the rain.Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the\nsurface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there.From such a picture the girl fled in tears.But the sight of it, and of\nothers like it, haunted her for weeks.Through those last dreary days of\nNovember, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and\nprosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes.The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been\nwritten.Still they came by the hundred, those families.The father of one, hale and strong when\nthey started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house.The walls\nof that house could tell many tales to wring the heart.Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities.He found\ntime, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his\ncorrespondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and\nmidnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already\novertaxed.All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains\nof articles once dear--a child's doll, a little rocking-chair, a \nprint that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit\nold clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention.Christmas\nwas drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth.And many of the wanderers\nwere unclothed and unfed.More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men.Louis to take charge of the Department,\nand the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care\nfor the refugees.A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and\nthe verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No.\"Inasmuch,\" said the General, \"as the Secession army had driven these\npeople from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to\nsupport them.\"He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.Indignation was rife the day that order was published.Sixty prominent\n\"disloyalists\" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten\nthousand dollars.\"They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent,\" cried\nMr.Who were\nto be on this mysterious list of \"Sixty\"?That was the all-absorbing\nquestion of the town.It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous\nones.Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr.Addison Colfax\nlived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared\nwould break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries,\ngave her niece not a little amusement.For Virginia was human, and one\nmorning she went to her aunt's room to read this editorial from the\nnewspaper:-- \"For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well\nto state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand\ndollar list.\"\"Jinny,\" she cried, \"how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when\nyou know that I am in a state of frenzy now?It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to\npay.We are the only women of importance in the city.\"That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to\nBellegarde.Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were\nleft in the big house.Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been\nhired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running,\nlong-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell.Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or\npacing the floor restlessly.He was observed\nnight and day by Federal detectives.Virginia strove to amuse him, to\nconceal her anxiety as she watched him.Well she knew that but for her\nhe would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of\nthe night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go.Ten years\nhad seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of\nChristmas eves past and gone of her father's early home-coming from the\nstore, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily\ninto the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson.The\nCaptain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he\nwould confide to Ned with a knowing wink.And then the house would be\nlighted from top to bottom, and Mr.Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr.Carvel over great bowls of\napple toddy and egg-nog.And Virginia would have her own friends in the\nbig parlor.That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his\nChristmas dinner at Colonel Carvel's house.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.Brice's little table, and wondered whether he would miss\nthem as much as they missed him.War may break friendships, but it\ncannot take away the sacredness of memories.The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood\nlooking out of the sitting-room window.A man's figure muffled in\na greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes.It was the same United States deputy marshal she had\nseen the day before at Mr.\"Pa,\" she cried, \"do you think he is coming here?\"\"Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room.I could not bear to see them take that.Let me put\nit in the garret.\"The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.We must leave this house just as it is.\"Then he added,\nstrangely enough for him, \"God's will be done.\"And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with\nhis apron on.\"Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?\"The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself.He was an imposing\nfigure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy.Virginia's first impulse was to shrink under the stairs.Then she came\nout and stood beside her father.He was a young man with a smooth face, and\na frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia.He did not appear\nto relish the duty thrust upon him.He fumbled in his coat and drew from\nhis inner pocket a paper.\"Colonel Carvel,\" said he, \"by order of Major General Halleck, I serve\nyou with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars\nfor the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven\nfrom their homes.In default of payment within a reasonable time such\npersonal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will\nsatisfy the demand against you.\"\"You may tell the\nGeneral that the articles may be seized.That I will not, while in my\nright mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me.\"It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to\ndinner.He had gone into many houses that week;\nhad seen indignation, hysterics, frenzy.He had even heard men and women\nwhose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their\nloyalty to the Union.But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl\nwho had stood silent beside them, were new.He bowed, and casting his\neyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully\npulled his goatee, and laughed gently.\"Lordy, we haven't got three\nhundred and fifty dollars to our names,\" said he.That fierce valley of the\nMissouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is\nsometimes quiet.Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet\nmelts, and windows are opened.In those days the streets will be fetlock\ndeep in soft mud.It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor\nanything.It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van,\naccompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States\nPolice, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr.Eugenie,\nwatching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who\ncame out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his\nFrench ancestors.Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply\nfilling its place.Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance\nhard to describe sat on her honest black face.I 'low you knows dat jes as well as me.\"An embarrassed\nsilence, and then from Mammy, \"Whaffor you laffin at?\"\"Now I reckon you knows dat he ain't.Ef he was, you ain't come here\n'quirin' in dat honey voice.\"\"You tink I\ndunno whaffor you come?You done come heah to rifle, an' to loot, an'\nto steal, an' to seize what ain't your'n.You come heah when young Marse\nain't to home ter rob him.\"\"Ned, whaffor you hidin'\nyonder?Ef yo' ain't man to protect Marse Comyn's prop-ty, jes han' over\nMarse Comyn's gun.\"The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled\nby this unexpected resistance.Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it\nwas evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort.cried Mammy, bursting with indignation.\"Who is\nyou to come heah 'quiring fo' her!I ain't agwine--\"\n\n\"Mammy!\"Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at\nher bandanna.\"Mammy, what is all this noise about?\"\"These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f'r t' carry away all yo' pa's\nblongin's.I jes' tol' 'em dey ain't comin' in ovah dis heah body.\"He caught sight of the face of\nMiss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly.\"I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma'am, to seize\npersonal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel.\"Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back.\"I do not see how\nI am to prevent you,\" she said.I--I can't tell you how sorry I am.Then he\nentered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around\nhim.\"I expect all that we want is right here,\" he said.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.And at the sight of\nthe great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled.Then he\nwalked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany\nstool, and ran his fingers over the keys.They seemed to Virginia,\nstanding motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.The piano, too, had been her mother's.It had once stood in the brick\nhouse of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale.The songs of Beatrice\nlay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.No more, of an evening\nwhen they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play\nthem over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his\ncigar,--dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl\nwho held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his\nside.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had\nplayed them for him on this piano.Often he had told Virginia of those\ndays, and walked with her over those paths.The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck.For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter.\"Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey.Dis ain't no place for us,\nI reckon.\"Her words were the essence of endearment.And yet, while she\npronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders.\"Oh, de good\nLawd'll burn de wicked!\"Virginia went back into the room\nand stood before the deputy.\"Isn't there something else you could take?\"I have a necklace--\"\n\n\"No, miss.And there ain't nothing quite\nso salable as pianos.\"She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away.Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and\nthat was because there was a pain in her own.They took the rosewood\nwhat-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could\ntouch them, and held them in her arms.They seized the mahogany\nvelvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and,\nlast of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near\nthe spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's\nparties.She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone.Ned closed the blinds once\nmore, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the\nstairs.CHAPTER V. THE AUCTION\n\n\"Stephen,\" said the Judge, in his abrupt way, \"there isn't a great deal\ndoing.Let's go over to the Secesh property sales.\"The seizures and intended sale of\nsecession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in\nthe city.There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as\nunjust and brutal.The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may\nonly be surmised.Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any\ngoods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day\nbecause it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember\nit.It was not that Stephen feared ostracism.Anne Brinsmade was almost the\nonly girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances.The Misses Russell showed him very\nplainly that they disapproved of his politics.The hospitable days at\nthat house were over.Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street,\npretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod.The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners,\nin sentiment against forced auctions.However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the\nJudge leaning on his arm.\"Stephen,\" said he, presently, \"I guess I'll do a little bidding.\"And, if he really wished to bid,\nStephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him.\"You don't approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose,\" said the Judge.\"Then,\" said the Judge, tartly, \"by bidding, we help to support starving\nUnion families.You should not be afraid to bid, sir.\"\"I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple.\"He did not see the smile on the\nJudge's face.\"Then you will bid in certain things for me,\" said Mr.Here\nhe hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench.\"Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted.Now I've got the\nchance to buy it cheap.\"There was silence again, for the space of a whole block.Finally,\nStephen managed to say:-- \"You'll have to excuse me, sir.cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so\nthat a wagon nearly ran over his toes.\"I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel's house, sir.Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to\nsay these things.The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart.And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street,\nwhich was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of\nVirginia.He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through.He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had\nactually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with\nthe piano that she had played on.The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they\ncame to Morgan's great warerooms.A crowd blocked the pavement, and\nhustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and\nladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom\nthey spoke to.All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might\nsee for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's\nhousehold goods.The long hall, which ran from street to street, was\npacked, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly\nagainst the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing\nall in a breath.The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way\nfiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a\nsecession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.In truth,\nit was at the Judge's suggestion that a blue provost's guard was called\nin later to protect the seized property.How many of those mahogany pieces, so ruthlessly tumbled about before\nthe public eye, meant a heartache!Wedding presents of long ago, dear to\nmany a bride with silvered hair, had been torn from the corner where the\nchildren had played--children who now, alas, were grown and gone to war.Yes, that was the Brussels rug that had lain before the fire, and which\nthe little feet had worn in the corner.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Those were the chairs the little\nhands had harnessed, four in a row, and fallen on its side was the\narmchair--the stage coach itself.There were the books, held up to\ncommon gaze, that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection.Yes, and\nhere in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family\ncarriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the\nhappy brood of children, now scattered and gone to war.As Stephen reached his place beside the Judge, Mr.And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have\ndropped dead.The heavy dining-room table which meant so much to the\nfamily went for a song to a young man recently come from Yankeeland,\nwhose open boast it was--like Eliphalet's secret one--that he would one\nday grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the Southern\naristocrats.Catherwood, his face\nhaggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her\nsilver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.Stephen looked in vain for Colonel Carvel--for Virginia.He did not want\nto see them there.He knew by heart the list of things which had been\ntaken from their house.He understood the feeling which had sent the\nJudge here to bid them in.When the auctioneer came to the Carvel list, and the well-known name was\nshouted out, the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the\nstand.And murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction.\"Now, gentlemen, and ladies,\" said the seller, \"this here is a genuine\nEnglish Rothfield piano once belonging to Colonel Carvel, and the\ncelebrated Judge Colfax of Kaintucky.\"He lingered fondly over the\nnames, that the impression might have time to sink deep.\"This here\nmagnificent instrument's worth at the very least\" (another pause)\n\"twelve hundred dollars.He struck a base note of the keys, then a treble, and they vibrated\nin the heated air of the big hall.Had he hit the little C of the top\noctave, the tinkle of that also might have been heard.\"Gentlemen and ladies, we have to begin somewheres.A menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence.Some there were\nwho gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no intention\nof committing social suicide.Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which\npenetrated to St.The owner was\na seedy man with a straw-, drunkard's mustache.He was leaning\nagainst the body of Mrs.Russell's barouche (seized for sale), and those\nabout him shrank away as from smallpox.His hundred-dollar offer was\nfollowed by a hiss.When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a\nwarning to those that knew him.As he doubled the bid, the words came\nout with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life\nhas been used to opposition.He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed\nhimself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to\nthe floor.And this is how Judge Whipple braved public opinion once more.As he\nstood there, defiant, many were the conjectures as to what he could wish\nto do with the piano of his old friend.Those who knew the Judge (and\nthere were few who did not) pictured to themselves the dingy little\napartment where he lived, and smiled.Whatever his detractors might have\nsaid of him, no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold\nanything for gain.Could it have been of admiration for\nthe fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him?\"Give me a strong and consistent enemy,\" some great personage has said,\n\"rather than a lukewarm friend.\"Three score and five years the Judge\nhad lived, and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart.But it was let out to many more\nthat day, and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his\nname with bitterness.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.Before he of the yellow mustache could pick up\nhis cigar from the floor and make another bid, the Judge had cried out\na sum which was the total of Colonel Carvel's assessment.Many recall\nto this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth\nof itself; and when he turned to go they made a path for him, in\nadmiration, the length of the hall, down which he stalked, looking\nneither to the right nor left.Stephen followed him, thankful for the\nday which had brought him into the service of such a man.And so it came about that the other articles were returned to Colonel\nCarvel with the marshal's compliments, and put back into the cold parlor\nwhere they had stood for many years.The men who brought them offered to\nput down the carpet, but by Virginia's orders the rolls were stood up in\nthe corner, and the floor left bare.And days passed into weeks, and no\nsign or message came from Judge Whipple in regard to the piano he had\nbought.Virginia did not dare mention it to the Colonel.It had been carried by six sweating <DW64>s up the\nnarrow stairs into the Judge's office.Whipple's orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of\npapers and books and rubbish, and there the bulky instrument was finally\nset up.The Judge watched the\nproceeding grimly, choking now and again from the dust that was raised,\nyet uttering never a word.He locked the lid when the van man handed him\nthe key, and thrust that in his pocket.Stephen had of late found enough to do in St.He was the kind of\nman to whom promotions came unsought, and without noise.In the autumn\nhe had been made a captain in the Halleck Guards of the State Militia,\nas a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge\nof tactics.Twice his company had been called out at night, and once\nthey made a campaign as far as the Merimec and captured a party of\nrecruits who were destined for Jefferson Davis.Brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit, and yet scarcely\na day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital.For\nStephen helped in the work of the Sanitary Commission too, and so strove\nto make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give.Brinsmade moved out to their place on the\nBellefontaine Road.This was to force Anne to take a rest.For the\ngirl was worn out with watching at the hospitals, and with tending\nthe destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees.The\nBrinsmade place was not far from the Fair Grounds,--now a receiving\ncamp for the crude but eager regiments of the Northern states.Brinsmade's, when the day's duty was done, the young Union officers\nused to ride, and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea.That\nhouse, and other great houses on the Bellefontaine Road with which this\nhistory has no occasion to deal, were as homes to many a poor fellow who\nwould never see home again.Sometimes Anne would gather together such\nyoung ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as\ntheir interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a Union officer,\nand there would be a little dance.To these dances Stephen Brice was\nusually invited.One such occasion occurred on a Friday in January, and Mr.Brinsmade\nhimself called in his buggy and drove Stephen to the country early in\nthe afternoon.He and Anne went for a walk along the river, the surface\nof which was broken by lumps of yellow ice.Gray clouds hung low in the\nsky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed\nfields.The grass was all a yellow-brown, but the north wind which\nswayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to Anne's cheeks.Before\nthey realized where they were, they had nearly crossed the Bellegarde\nestate, and the house itself was come into view, standing high on the\n<DW72> above the withered garden.Colfax had\ncome out here not long a--\"\n\n\"She came out for a day just before Christina,\" said Anne, smiling, \"and\nthen she ran off to Kentucky.I think she was afraid that she was one of\nthe two women on the list of Sixty.\"\"It must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not,\"\nsaid Stephen, who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain\nSunday not a year gone.Impelled by the same inclination, they walked in silence to the house\nand sat down on the edge of the porch.The only motion in the view was\nthe smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind, and the hurrying\nice in the stream.said Anne, with a sigh, \"how she loved to romp!What good\ntimes we used to have here together!\"But you could not make her show\nit.The other morning when she came out to our house I found her sitting\nat the piano.I am sure there were tears in her eyes, but she would not\nlet me see them.She made some joke about Spencer Catherwood running\naway.What do you think the Judge will do with that piano, Stephen?\"\"The day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black\ncloth, which he spread over it.And Anne, turning to him timidly, gave him a long,\nsearching look.They went out by the long entrance road, through the naked woods.Only a little while before he had had one of those\nvivid dreams of Virginia which left their impression, but not their\nsubstance, to haunt him.On those rare days following the dreams her\nspirit had its mastery over his.He pictured her then with a glow on her\nface which was neither sadness nor mirth,--a glow that ministered to\nhim alone.And yet, he did not dare to think that he might have won her,\neven if politics and war had not divided them.When the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening, Stephen\nstood at the door of the long room, meditatively watching the bright\ngowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past.Presently the opposite door opened, and he heard Mr.Brinsmade's voice\nmingling with another, the excitable energy of which recalled some\nfamiliar episode.Almost--so it seemed--at one motion, the owner of the\nvoice had come out of the door and had seized Stephen's hand in a warm\ngrasp,--a tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer.The\nmilitary frock, which fitted the man's character rather than the man,\nwas carelessly open, laying bare a gold-buttoned white waistcoat and an\nexpanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie.The ends of the\ncollar were apart the width of the red clipped beard, and the mustache\nwas cropped straight along the line of the upper lip.The forehead rose\nhigh, and was brushed carelessly free of the hair.The nose was almost\nstraight, but combative.\"The boy doesn't remember me,\" said the gentleman, in quick tones,\nsmiling at Mr.\"Yes, sir, I do,\" Stephen made haste to answer.He glanced at the star\non the shoulder strap, and said.laughed the General, patting him.\"Now in command at Camp Benton, Stephen,\" Mr.\"Won't\nyou sit down, General?\"\"No,\" said the General, emphatically waving away the chair.Then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusement,--and\nmischief, Stephen thought.\"So you've heard of me since we met, sir?\"Guess you heard I was crazy,\" said the General, in his downright\nway.\"He's been reading the lies in the newspapers too, Brinsmade,\" the\nGeneral went on rapidly.\"I'll make 'em eat their newspapers for saying\nI was crazy.That's the Secretary of War's doings.Ever tell you what\nCameron did, Brinsmade?He and his party were in Louisville last fall,\nwhen I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine,\nAfter lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over.He\nasked me what I thought about things in Kentucky.Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the\nPotomac to Kansas.Here's McClellan in the East with one hundred miles\nof front.Here's Fremont in the West with one hundred miles.Here we\nare in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend.McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand.You\ngive us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.''Two hundred\nthousand before we get through,' said I. Cameron pitched up his hands\nin the air.says he, 'where are they to come from?''The\nnorthwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won't\naccept,' said I.Secretary, you'll need 'em all and\nmore before we get done with this Rebellion.'Well, sir, he was very\nfriendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed\nout.he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I'm\ncrazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky.Then I am ordered\nto report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia\nbecause he believes the lies.\"Stephen, who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two\nbefore, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at the man in\nfront of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who\ntook his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could\nbelieve them.\"They have to print something, General,\" he said.\"I'll give 'em something to print later on,\" answered the General,\ngrimly.\"Brinsmade, you fellows did have\na session with Fremont, didn't you?Anderson sent me over here last\nSeptember, and the first man I ran across at the Planters' House was\nAppleton. ''To see Fremont,'\nI said.'You don't think\nFremont'll see you, do you?''Well,' says Tom, 'go\n'round to his palace at six to-morrow morning and bribe that Hungarian\nprince who runs his body-guard to get you a good place in the line of\nsenators and governors and first citizens, and before nightfall you\nmay get a sight of him, since you come from Anderson.Not one man in\na hundred,' says Appleton, I not one man in a hundred, reaches his\nchief-of-staff.'Next morning,\" the General continued in a staccato\nwhich was often his habit, \"had breakfast before daybreak and went\n'round there.Place just swarming with Californians--army contracts.\"More\nCalifornians, and by gad--old Baron Steinberger with his nose hanging\nover the register.\"\"Fremont was a little difficult to get at, General,\" said Mr.\"Things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were\nawarded.Fremont was a good man, and it wasn't his fault that the\ninexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get\nrich.\"To be sure\nhe was--didn't get along with Blair.These court-martials you're having\nhere now have stirred up the whole country.I guess we'll hear now how\nthose fortunes were made.To listen to those witnesses lie about each\nother on the stand is better than the theatre.\"Stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the General set\nthis matter forth.He himself had been present one day of the sittings\nof the court-martial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules\nwas that same seedy man with the straw- mustache who had bid for\nVirginia's piano against the Judge.\"Come, Stephen,\" said the General, abruptly, \"run and snatch one of\nthose pretty girls from my officers.Whereupon the General laid\nhis hand impulsively on the young man's shoulder, divining what Stephen\ndid not say.said be; \"you are doing the work in this war, not we.We\ndo the damage--you repair it.Brinsmade and you\ngentlemen who help him, where would our Western armies be?Don't you\ngo to the front yet a while, young man.We need the best we have\nin reserve.\"\"You've had military\ntraining of some sort?\"\"He's a captain in the Halleck Guards, sir,\" said Mr.Brinsmade,\ngenerously, \"and the best drillmaster we've had in this city.He's seen\nservice, too, General.\"Stephen reddened furiously and started to protest, when the General\ncried:-- \"It's more than I have in this war.Come, come, I knew he was a\nsoldier.Let's see what kind of a strategist he'll make.Brinsmade, have\nyou got such a thing as a map?\"Brinsmade had, and led the way back\ninto the library.The General shut the door, lighted a cigar with a\nsingle vigorous stroke of a match, and began to smoke with quick puffs.Stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the General was\ngiving out with such freedom.When the map was laid on the table, the General drew a pencil from his\npocket and pointed to the state of Kentucky.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Then he drew a line from\nColumbus to Bowling Green, through Forts Donelson and Henry.\"Now, Stephen,\" said he, \"there's the Rebel line.Show me the proper\nplace to break it.\"Stephen hesitated a while, and then pointed at the centre.He drew a heavy line across the\nfirst, and it ran almost in the bed of the Tennessee River.\"Very question Halleck asked me the other day, and that's\nhow I answered it.Now, gentlemen, there's a man named Grant down in\nthat part of the country.He used to live here once, and a year ago he was less than I\nwas.The recollection of the scene in the street by the Arsenal that May\nmorning not a year gone came to Stephen with a shock.\"I saw him,\" he cried; \"he was Captain Grant that lived on the Gravois\nRoad.But surely this can't be the same man who seized Paducah and was\nin that affair at Belmont.\"They kicked him around Springfield awhile, after\nthe war broke out, for a military carpet-bagger.Then they gave him for\na regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on.He made 'em march halfway across the\nstate instead of taking the cars the Governor offered.I guess\nhe is the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont.Then his boys broke\nloose when they got into the town.The Rebs\ncame back and chased 'em out into their boats on the river.Brinsmade,\nyou remember hearing about that.\"Grant did the coolest thing you ever saw.He sat on his horse at the\ntop of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on\nthe boat.Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a\ncigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him.And then, sir,\"\ncried the General, excitedly, \"what do you think he did?Hanged if he\ndidn't force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole\nlength of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the\nsteamer.And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared.They were so\nastonished they didn't even shoot the man.\"And now, Stephen,\" he added, \"just you run off and take hold\nof the prettiest girl you can find.If any of my boys object, say I sent\nyou.\"It was little Tiefel, now a first\nlieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face, come to town on a few\ndays' furlough.He had been with Lyon at Wilson's Creek, and he had\na sad story to tell of how he found poor Richter, lying stark on that\nbloody field, with a smile of peace upon his face.Strange that he\nshould at length have been killed by a sabre!It was a sad meeting for those two, since each reminded the other of\na dear friend they would see no more on earth.They went out to sup\ntogether in the German style; and gradually, over his beer, Tiefel\nforgot his sorrow.Stephen listened with an ache to the little man's\ntales of the campaigns he had been through.So that presently Tiefel\ncried out:\n\n\"Why, my friend, you are melancholy as an owl.\"He is no more crazy than I am,\" said Stephen, warmly--\n\n\"Is he not?\"answered Tiefel, \"then I will show you a mistake.You\nrecall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there,\nand he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Now up\ngets your General Sherman in the middle of the night,--midnight,--and\nmarches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms.So, says\nhe, 'land so,' says he, 'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here,\nand this column will take that road, and so-and-so's a damned fool.So he walks up and down for three eternal hours.Says\nhe, 'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at\nSedalia with his regiments all over the place.They must both go into\ncamp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops\nmay be handled.'\"\"If that's insanity,\" cried Stephen so strongly as to surprise the\nlittle man; \"then I wish we had more insane generals.It just shows\nhow a malicious rumor will spread.What Sherman said about Pope's and\nSteele's forces is true as Gospel, and if you ever took the trouble to\nlook into that situation, Tiefel, you would see it.\"And Stephen brought\ndown his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump.It was not a month after that that Sherman's prophecy of the quiet\ngeneral who had slid down the bluff at Belmont came true.The whole\ncountry bummed with Grant's praises.Moving with great swiftness and\nsecrecy up the Tennessee, in company with the gunboats of Commodore\nFoote, he had pierced the Confederate line at the very point Sherman\nhad indicated.Fort Henry had fallen, and Grant was even then moving to\nbesiege Donelson.Brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield, taking with\nhim too Paducah physicians and nurses.All day long the boat was loading\nwith sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded.It was muggy\nand wet--characteristic of that winter--as Stephen pushed through the\ndrays on the slippery levee to the landing.He had with him a basket his mother had put up.Brinsmade from the Judge It was while he was picking his way\nalong the crowded decks that he ran into General Sherman.The General\nseized him unceremoniously by the shoulder.\"Good-by, General,\" said Stephen, shifting his basket to shake hands.\"Ordered to Paducah,\" said the General.He pulled Stephen off the guards\ninto an empty cabin.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.\"Brice,\" said he, earnestly, \"I haven't forgotten\nhow you saved young Brinsmade at Camp Jackson.They tell me that you are\nuseful here.I say, don't go in unless you have to.But when you feel that you can go in, come to me or\nwrite me a letter.That is,\" he added, seemingly inspecting Stephen's\nwhite teeth with approbation, \"if you're not afraid to serve under a\ncrazy man.\"It has been said that the General liked the lack of effusiveness of\nStephen's reply.ELIPHALET PLAYS HIS TRUMPS\n\nSummer was come again.Through interminable days, the sun beat down upon\nthe city; and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat\nwith which he had filled them.Great battles had been fought, and vast\narmies were drawing breath for greater ones to come.\"Jinny,\" said the Colonel one day, \"as we don't seem to be much use in\ntown, I reckon we may as well go to Glencoe.\"Virginia, threw her arms around her father's neck.For many months\nshe had seen what the Colonel himself was slow to comprehend--that his\nusefulness was gone.The days melted into weeks, and Sterling Price and\nhis army of liberation failed to come.The vigilant Union general and\nhis aides had long since closed all avenues to the South.For, one fine\nmorning toward the end of the previous summer, when the Colonel was\ncontemplating a journey, he had read that none might leave the city\nwithout a pass, whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the Provost\nMarshal.There he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight,\neach waving a pass made out by the Provost Marshal's clerks, and waiting\nfor that officer's signature.The Colonel also procured one of these,\nand fell into line.The Marshal gazed at the crowd, pulled off his coat,\nand readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east.Bub Ballington, whom the Colonel knew, but pretended not\nto.\"Not very profitable to be a minute-man, eh?\"Ballington trying not to look indignant\nas he makes for the door.A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's\ndesk, the one word: \"Spot!\"breaks the intense silence, which is one way\nof saying that Mr.Ballington is detained, and will probably be lodged\nthat night at Government expense.\"Well, Colonel Carvel, what can I do for you this morning?\"The Colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow.\"I reckon I'll wait\ntill next week, Captain,\" said Mr.\"It's pretty hot to travel\njust now.\"There were many in the office who\nwould have liked to laugh, but it did not pay to laugh at some people.In the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable\nthan ever.All who were convicted by a court-martial of being rebels\nwere to have property confiscated, and slaves set free.Then there was\na certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have\nguardians appointed over their actions.There were many who swallowed\nthis oath and never felt any ill effects.Jacob Cluyme was one, and\ncame away feeling very virtuous.Hopper did not have indigestion after taking it, but\nColonel Carvel would sooner have eaten, gooseberry pie, which he had\nnever tasted but once.That summer had worn away, like a monster which turns and gives hot\ngasps when you think it has expired.It took the Arkansan just a month,\nunder Virginia's care, to become well enough to be sent to a Northern\nprison He was not precisely a Southern gentleman, and he went to sleep\nover the \"Idylls of the King.\"But he was admiring, and grateful, and\nwept when he went off to the boat with the provost's guard, destined\nfor a Northern prison.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.He had taken her away from\nher aunt (who would have nothing to do with him), and had given her\noccupation.She nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of\nPrice's rough army.His departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set.The\nfavor had caused comment and trouble, hence there was no hope of giving\nanother sufferer the same comfort.One of\nthe mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of Colonel\nCarvel's house was arrested on the ferry, but he had contrived to be rid\nof the carpet-sack in which certain precious letters were carried.Hopper's visits to Locust Street had\ncontinued at intervals of painful regularity.It is not necessary to\ndwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation, nor to repeat the\nplatitudes which he repeated, for there was no significance in Mr.The Colonel had found that out, and was\nthankful.His manners were better; his English decidedly better.It was for her father's sake, of course, that Virginia bore with\nhim.She tried to be just, and it\noccurred to her that she had never before been just.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Again and again she\nrepeated to herself that Eliphalet's devotion to the Colonel at this\nlow ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect\nhim.Hopper as an uneducated Yankee\nand a person of commercial ideals.But now he was showing virtues,--if\nvirtues they were,--and she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.With his great shrewdness and business ability, why did he not take\nadvantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune?For Virginia had of late been going to the store with the Colonel,--who\nspent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers, and Mr.Hopper\nhad always been at his desk.After this, Virginia even strove to be kind to him, but it was uphill\nwork.The front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion\nwas not left behind.Could it be that\nthere was a motive under all this plotting?He struck her inevitably as\nthe kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end.The\nworst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself\nnow, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner\nin Mr.She had put even this away as unworthy of her.Once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject.\"I believe I did him an injustice, Pa,\" she said.\"Not that I like him\nany better now.But I do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as I thought, he\nwould have deserted you long ago for something more profitable.He would\nnot be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business\nwhen the war is over.\"She remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper.\"You are a good girl, Jinny,\" he said.Toward the end of July of that second summer riots broke out in the\ncity, and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on Virginia's horizon.This took the form, for Northerners, of a guerilla scare, and an order\nwas promptly issued for the enrollment of all the able-bodied men in the\nten wards as militia, subject to service in the state, to exterminate\nthe roving bands.Whereupon her Britannic Majesty became extremely\npopular,--even with some who claimed for a birthplace the Emerald Isle.Hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their British citizenship\nmade haste to renew their allegiance; and many sought the office of the\nEnglish Consul whose claims on her Majesty's protection were vague, to\nsay the least.For the first time,\nwhen Virginia walked to the store with her father, Eliphalet was not\nthere.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.\"I don't blame him for not wanting to fight for the Yankees,\" she said.\"Then why doesn't he fight for the South he asked\"\n\n\"Fight for the South!\"\"I reckon not, too,\" said the Colonel, dryly.For the following week curiosity prompted Virginia to take that walk\nwith the Colonel.Hopper being still absent, she helped him to sort\nthe papers--those grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone\nby.Carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some\nincident to his mind; for he would drop it absently on his desk, his\nhand seeking his chin, and remain for half an hour lost in thought.The Colonel answered\nthem all truthfully--generally with that dangerous suavity for which he\nwas noted.Twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in\nto ask Eliphalet's whereabouts.On the second occasion this individual\nbecame importunate.\"You don't know nothin' about him, you say?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.\"I 'low I kin 'lighten you a little.\"\"Good day, sir,\" said the Colonel.\"I guess you'll like to hear what I've got to say.\"Carvel in his natural voice, \"show this man out.\"Ford slunk out without Ephum's assistance.But he half turned at the\ndoor, and shot back a look that frightened Virginia.\"Oh, Pa,\" she cried, in alarm, \"what did he mean?\"\"I couldn't tell you, Jinny,\" he answered.But she noticed that he was\nvery thoughtful as they walked home.The next morning Eliphalet had not\nreturned, but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for\nhim.The Colonel read the order, and invited them in with hospitality.He even showed them the way upstairs, and presently Virginia heard them\nall tramping overhead among the bales.Her eye fell upon the paper they\nhad brought, which lay unfolded on her father's desk.It was signed\nStephen A. Brice, Enrolling Officer.That very afternoon they moved to Glencoe, and Ephum was left in sole\ncharge of the store.At Glencoe, far from the hot city and the cruel\nwar, began a routine of peace.Virginia was a child again, romping\nin the woods and fields beside her father.The color came back to her\ncheeks once more, and the laughter into her voice.The two of them, and\nNed and Mammy, spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom\nof which Dick had known so long, before the old horse was caught and\nbrought back into bondage.After that Virginia took long drives with her\nfather, and coming home, they would sit in the summer house high above\nthe Merimec, listening to the crickets' chirp, and watching the day fade\nupon the water.The Colonel, who had always detested pipes, learned to\nsmoke a corncob.He would sit by the hour, with his feet on the rail of\nthe porch and his hat tilted back, while Virginia read to him.Poe\nand Wordsworth and Scott he liked, but Tennyson was his favorite.One afternoon when Virginia was sitting in the summer house alone, her\nthoughts wandering back, as they sometimes did, to another afternoon\nshe had spent there,--it seemed so long ago,--when she saw Mammy Easter\ncoming toward her.\"Honey, dey's comp'ny up to de house.He's\non de porch, talkin' to your Pa.In truth, the solid figure of Eliphalet himself was on the path some\ntwenty yards behind her.His hat was in his hand; his hair was plastered\ndown more neatly than ever, and his coat was a faultless and sober\ncreation of a Franklin Avenue tailor.He carried a cane, which was\nunheard of.Virginia sat upright, and patted her skirts with a gesture\nof annoyance--what she felt was anger, resentment.Suddenly she rose,\nswept past Mammy, and met him ten paces from the summer house.\"How-dy-do, Miss Virginia,\" he cried pleasantly.\"Your father had a\nnotion you might be here.\"Her greeting would have frozen a man\nof ardent temperament.But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet\nshowed.There was something in\nthe man's air to-day.platano, plantain tree, or its fruit.por el amor del cielo, for the love of heaven!pozo, well, pond, puddle.Q\n\nquebrada, creek, small stream.quemador, public square where heretics were burned.R\n\nreal (reales), a silver coin, valued at 5, 10, or 12-1/2 cents.religion de dinero, a religion of money.ruana, a cape worn by the poor males of tropical America.rurales, country people, peasants, farmers.S\n\nsacristia, sacristy.san benito, the garb worn by condemned heretics.santa virgen, the sainted Virgin.senora, Madam, Mrs., a mature woman, a married woman.senorita, Miss, a young unmarried woman.sepulcros, tombs, graves.siesta, the midday hour of rest, the hottest part of the day.toldo, awning, the mosquito netting hung over beds.trago, tragito, a drink, a draught.Y\n\nya esta, vamonos, all ready, let's go!yucca, or yuca, the yucca plant or its roots.[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL SHEFFIELD NINE-PIN.*       *       *       *       *\n\nTO DOROTHY.(_My Four-year-old Sweetheart._)\n\n  To make sweet hay I was amazed to find\n    You absolutely did not know the way,\n  Though when you did, it seemed much to your mind\n                  To make sweet hay.You were kind\n  Enough to answer, \"Why, _of course_, you may.\"I kissed your pretty face with hay entwined,\n  We made sweet hay.But what will Mother say\n    If in a dozen years we're still inclined\n                  To make sweet hay?*       *       *       *       *\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nAlternative spellings retained.When I reached the patient, I found her sitting up in\n     bed.Her pulse was irregular;

every eye was riveted upon her.She seemed, however, superbly indifferent to the curiosity she aroused,\nand one felt, somehow, that she was not only indifferent but\ncontemptuous.She was a tall woman, taller, although she stooped a little, than most\nof the men present.Notwithstanding her great age, she gave the\nimpression of extraordinary vigour.Her face was long and narrow, with a\nstern, hawk-like nose, a straight, uncompromising mouth, and a\nprotruding chin.Her scanty, white hair was drawn tightly back from her\nhigh forehead; a deep furrow separated her bushy, grey eyebrows and gave\nan added fierceness to her small, steel-coloured eyes.An antiquated\nbonnet perched perilously on the back of her head; her dress was quite\nobviously shabby; and yet no one could for a moment have mistaken her\nfor anything but a truly great lady.Disregarding Cyril's outstretched hand, she deliberately raised her\nlorgnette and looked at him for a moment in silence.You are a Crichton at any rate,\" she said at last.Having given\nvent to this ambiguous remark, she waved her glasses, as if to sweep\naway the rest of the company, and continued: \"I wish to speak to you\nalone.\"Her voice was deep and harsh and she made no effort to lower it.\"So this was Anita Wilmersley's grandmother.\"It is almost time for the funeral to start,\" he said aloud and he tried\nto convey by his manner that he, at any rate, had no intention of\nallowing her to ride rough-shod over him.\"I know,\" she snapped, \"so hurry, please.Cyril heard them\nmurmur and, such was the force of the old lady's personality, that\nyouths and grey beards jostled each other in their anxiety to get out of\nthe room as quickly as possible.\"Get me a chair,\" commanded Lady Upton.I want to sit\ndown, not lie down.\"With her stick she indicated a high, straight-backed chair, which had\nbeen relegated to a corner.Having seated herself, she took a pair of spectacles out of her reticule\nand proceeded to wipe them in a most leisurely manner.Finally, her task completed to her own satisfaction, she adjusted her\nglasses and crossed her hands over the top of her cane.\"No news of my granddaughter, I suppose,\" she demanded.\"Anita is a fool, but I am certain--absolutely certain, mind you--that\nshe did not kill that precious husband of hers, though I don't doubt he\nrichly deserved it.\"\"I am surprised that you of all people should speak of my cousin in that\ntone,\" said Cyril and he looked at her meaningly.\"Of course, you believe what every one believes, that I forced Ann into\nthat marriage.I merely pointed out to her that she\ncould not do better than take him.She had not a penny to her name and\nafter my death would have been left totally unprovided for.I have only\nmy dower, as you know.\"\"But, how could you have allowed a girl whose mind was affected to\nmarry?\"You don't believe that nonsense, do you?Newspaper\ntwaddle, that is all that amounts to.\"\"I beg your pardon, Arthur himself gave out that her condition was such\nthat she was unable to see any one.\"He wrote to me quite frequently and never hinted at such a\nthing.\"\"Nevertheless I assure you that is the case.\"\"Then he is a greater blackguard than I took him to be----\"\n\n\"But did you not know that he kept her practically a prisoner here?\"\"And she never complained to you of his treatment of her?\"\"I once got a hysterical letter from her begging me to let her come back\nto me, but as the only reason she gave for wishing to leave her husband\nwas that he was personally distasteful to her, I wrote back that as she\nhad made her bed, she must lie on it.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.\"And even after that appeal you never made an attempt to see Anita and\nfind out for yourself how Arthur was treating her?\"\"I am not accustomed to being cross-questioned, Lord Wilmersley.I am\naccountable to no one but my God for what I have done or failed to do.She takes after her father, whom my daughter married\nwithout my consent.When she was left an orphan, I took charge of her\nand did my duty by her; but I never pretended that I was not glad when\nshe married and, as she did so of her own free-will, I cannot see that\nher future life was any concern of mine.\"Cyril could hardly restrain his indignation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.This proud, hard, selfish\nold woman had evidently never ceased to visit her resentment of her\ndaughter's marriage on the child of that marriage.He could easily\npicture the loveless and miserable existence poor Anita must have led.Was it surprising that she should have taken the first chance that was\noffered her of escaping from her grandmother's thraldom?She had\nprobably been too ignorant to realise what sort of a man Arthur\nWilmersley really was and too innocent to know what she was pledging\nherself to.\"I have come here to-day,\" continued Lady Upton, \"because I considered\nit seemly that my granddaughter's only relative should put in an\nappearance at the funeral and also because I wanted you to tell me\nexactly what grounds the police have for suspecting Anita.\"Cyril related as succinctly as possible everything which had so far come\nto light.He, however, carefully omitted to mention his meeting with the\ngirl on the train.As the latter could not be Anita Wilmersley, he felt\nthat he was not called upon to inform Lady Upton of this episode.exclaimed Lady Upton, when he had finished.\"All I can say is,\nthat Anita is quite incapable of firing a pistol at any one, even if it\nwere thrust into her hand.You may not believe me, but that is because\nyou don't know her.Unless\nArthur had frightened her out of her wits, she would never have screwed\nup courage to leave him, and it would be just like her to crawl away in\nthe night instead of walking out of the front door like a sensible\nperson.I have no patience with such a spineless creature!You men,\nhowever, consider it an engaging feminine attribute for a woman to have\nneither character nor sense!\"Lady Upton snorted contemptuously and", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "As he made no answer to her tirade, she continued after a moment more\ncalmly.\"It seems to me highly improbable that Anita has been murdered; so I\nwant you to engage a decent private detective who will work only for us.We must find her before the police do so.I take it for granted that you\nwill help me in this matter and that you are anxious--although,\nnaturally, not as anxious as I am--to prevent your cousin's widow from\nbeing arrested.\"\"A woman who has been treated by her husband as Arthur seems to have\ntreated Anita, is entitled to every consideration that her husband's\nfamily can offer her,\" replied Cyril.\"I am already employing a\ndetective and if he finds Anita I will communicate with you at once.\"Now remember that my granddaughter is perfectly sane; on the\nother hand, I think it advisable to keep this fact a secret for the\npresent.Circumstantial evidence is so strongly against her that we may\nhave to resort to the plea of insanity to save her neck.That girl has\nbeen a thorn in my flesh since the day she was born; but she shall not\nbe hanged, if I can help it,\" said Lady Upton, shutting her mouth with\nan audible click.CHAPTER IX\n\nTHE JEWELS\n\n\nAs soon as the funeral was over, Cyril left Geralton.On arriving in\nLondon he recognised several reporters at the station.Fearing that they\nmight follow him, he ordered his taxi to drive to the Carlton.There he\ngot out and walking quickly through the hotel, he made his exit by a\nrear door.Having assured himself that he was not being observed, he\nhailed another taxi and drove to the nursing home.Thompkins,\" exclaimed the doctor, with ponderous\nfacetiousness.\"I am glad to be able to tell you that Mrs.She does not yet remember people or incidents, but she\nis beginning to recall certain places.For instance, I asked her\nyesterday if she had been to Paris.It suggested nothing to her, but\nthis morning she told me with great pride that Paris was a city and that\nit had a wide street with an arch at one end.So you see she is\nprogressing; only we must not hurry her.\"Cyril murmured a vague assent.\"Of course,\" continued the doctor, \"you must be very careful when you\nsee Lady Wilmersley to restrain your emotions, and on no account to\nremind her of the immediate past.I hope and believe she will never\nremember it.On the other hand, I wish you to talk about those of her\nfriends and relations for whom she has shown a predilection.Her memory\nmust be gently stimulated, but on no account excited.Quiet, quiet is\nessential to her recovery.\"\"But doctor--I must--it's frightfully important that my wife (he found\nhimself calling her so quite glibly) should be told of a certain fact at\nonce.If I wait even a day, it will be too late,\" urged Cyril.\"And you have reason to suppose that this communication will agitate\nLady Wilmersley?\"You don't seem to realise the\ndelicate condition of her brain.Why, it might be fatal,\" insisted the\ndoctor.Cyril felt as if Nemesis were indeed overtaking him.\"Come, we will go to her,\" said the doctor, moving towards the door.\"She is naturally a little nervous about seeing you, so we must not keep\nher waiting.\"If he could not undeceive the poor girl, how could\nhe enter her presence.To pose as the husband of a woman so as to enable\nher to escape arrest was excusable, but to impose himself on the\ncredulity of an afflicted girl was absolutely revolting.If he treated\nher with even the most decorous show of affection, he would be taking a\ndastardly advantage of the situation.Yet if he behaved with too much\nreserve, she would conclude that her husband was a heartless brute.The one person she had to cling to in the isolation to which\nshe had awakened.Oh, why had he ever placed her in\nsuch an impossible position?He was\nsure that she could easily have proved her innocence of whatever it was\nof which she was accused, and in a few days at the latest would have\ngone free without a stain on her character, while now, unless by some\nmiracle this episode remained concealed, she was irredeemably\ncompromised.He was a married man; she, for aught he knew to the\ncontrary, might also be bound, or at all events have a fiance or lover\nwaiting to claim her.Cyril shuddered involuntarily.Every minute the\nchances that her secret could be kept decreased.If she did not return\nto her friends while it was still possible to explain or account for the\ntime of her absence, he feared she would never be able to return at all.Yes, it would take a miracle to save her now!The doctor's tone was peremptory and his piercing eyes\nwere fixed searchingly upon him.What excuse could he give for refusing\nto meet his supposed wife?\"I must remind you, doctor,\" he faltered at last, \"that my wife has\nlately detested me.I--I really don't think I had better see her--I--I\nam so afraid my presence will send her off her head again.\"The doctor's upper lip grew rigid and his eyes contracted angrily.\"I have already assured you that she is perfectly sane.It is essential\nto her recovery that she should see somebody connected with her past\nlife.I cannot understand your reluctance to meet Lady Wilmersley.\"\"I--I am only thinking of the patient,\" Cyril murmured feebly.\"The patient is my affair,\" snapped the doctor.For an instant he was again tempted to tell\nStuart-Smith the truth.And after all, he\nreflected, if he had an opportunity of watching the girl, she might\nquite unconsciously by some act, word, or even by some subtle essence of\nher personality furnish him with a clue to her past.Every occupation\nleaves indelible marks, although it sometimes takes keen eyes to discern\nthem.If the girl had been a seamstress, Cyril believed that he would be\nable by observing her closely to assure himself of the fact.\"If you are willing to assume the\nresponsibility, I will go to my wife at once.But I insist on your being\npresent at our meeting.\"\"Certainly, if you wish it, but it is not at all necessary, I assure\nyou,\" replied the doctor.A moment later Cyril, blushing like a schoolgirl, found himself in a\nlarge, white-washed room.Before him on a narrow, iron bedstead lay his\nmysterious _protegee_.Her red lips were slightly parted and the colour\nebbed and flowed in her transparent cheeks.Ignoring the doctor, her\neager glance sought Cyril and for a minute the two young people gazed at\neach other in silence.How could any\none doubt the candour of those star like eyes, thought Cyril.Crichton,\" exclaimed Stuart-Smith, \"I have brought you the\nhusband you have been so undutiful as to forget.'Love, honour, and\nobey, and above all remember,' I suggest as an amendment to the marriage\nvow.\"\"Nurse has been reading me the marriage service,\" said the girl, with a\nquaint mixture of pride and diffidence.\"I know all about it now; I\ndon't think I'll forget again.\"And now that you have seen your husband, do you find\nthat you remember him at all?\"I know that I have seen you before,\" she answered,\naddressing Cyril.\"I gather from your manner that you don't exactly dislike him, do you?\"asked the doctor with an attempt at levity.\"Your husband is so modest\nthat he is afraid to remain in your presence till you have reassured him\non this point.\"\"I love him very much,\" was her astounding answer.She\ncertainly showed no trace of embarrassment, and although her eyes clung\npersistently to his, their expression of childlike simplicity was\nabsolutely disarming.\"Very good, very good, quite as it should be,\" exclaimed the doctor,\nevidently a little abashed by the frankness of the girl's reply.\"That\nbeing the case, I will leave you two together to talk over old times,\nalthough they can't be very remote.I am sure, however, that when I see\nyou again, you will be as full of reminiscences as an octogenarian,\"\nchuckled the doctor as he left the room.An arm-chair had been placed near the bed, obviously for his reception,\nand after a moment's hesitation he took it.The girl did not speak, but\ncontinued to look at him unflinchingly.Cyril fancied she regarded him\nwith something of the unquestioning reverence a small child might have\nfor a beloved parent.Never had he felt so\nunworthy, so positively guilty.He racked his brains for something to\nsay, but the doctor's restrictions seemed to bar every topic which\nsuggested itself to him.In the dim light of the shaded lamp he had not noticed that\nwhat he had supposed was her hair, was in reality a piece of black lace\nbound turbanwise about her head.\"Was your\nhead hurt--my dear?\"\"No--I--I hope you won't be angry--nurse said you would--but I couldn't\nhelp it.She hung her head as a naughty child might have done.Strange that her first act had been to destroy one of the few things by\nwhich she could be identified.Had\nshe fooled them all, even the doctor?This amnesia, or whatever it was\ncalled, was it real, was it assumed?\"Oh, husband, I know it was wrong; but when I woke up and couldn't\nremember anything, I was so frightened, and then nurse brought me a\nlooking-glass and the face I saw was so strange!Oh, it was so lonely\nwithout even myself!She said it\nsometimes happened when people have had a great shock or been very ill\nand so--I made her cut it off.She didn't want to--it wasn't her\nfault--I made her do it.\"\"It had turned quite white, most of it.\"I am sure you would not have liked it.\"Cyril, looking into her limpid eyes, felt his sudden suspicions unworthy\nof him.\"You must grow a nice new crop of black curls, if you want to appease\nme,\" he answered.\"I know it was--but I hate it!At all events, as long as I must wear a\nwig, I should like to have a nice yellow one; nurse tells me I can get\nthem quite easily.\"But I don't think a wig nice at all.\"But she mustn't cry--anything\nrather than that.\"My dear, if you want a wig, you shall have one immediately.Tell your\nnurse to send to the nearest hairdresser for an assortment from which\nyou can make your choice.\"\"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" she cried, clapping her hands.Cyril had forgotten them for the moment, and it was through them that he\nhad hoped to establish her identity.No\nring encircled the wedding finger, nor did it show the depression which\nthe constant wearing of one invariably leaves.Those long, slender, well-kept hands certainly did not look\nas if they could belong to a servant, but he reflected that a\nseamstress' work was not of a nature to spoil them.Only the forefinger\nof her left hand would probably bear traces of needle pricks.\"At your hands, my dear,\" he tried to speak lightly.Yes, it was as he had expected--her forefinger was rough.She was\nPriscilla Prentice.Everything had fore-warned him of this conclusion,\nyet in his heart of hearts he had not believed it possible till this\nmoment.she asked, as she regarded them with anxious\nscrutiny, evidently trying to discover why they failed to find favour in\nthe sight of her lord.\"They are--\" He checked himself; he had almost added--the prettiest\nhands in the world; but he mustn't say such things to her, not under the\ncircumstances.\"They are very pretty, only you have sewn so much that\nyou have quite spoiled one little finger.\"Further proof of her identity, if he needed it.\"Well, you must get nurse to find you something on which to exercise\nyour talents--only you must be careful not to prick yourself so much in\nfuture.\"\"I will try, husband,\" she answered meekly, as she gazed solemnly at the\noffending finger.\"Do tell me something about my past life,\" said she.\"I have been lying\nhere wondering and wondering.\"In the first place, are my parents living?Cyril had no idea whether her parents were alive or\nnot, but even if they were, it would be impossible to communicate with\nthem for the present, so he had better set her mind at rest by denying\ntheir existence.\"No, my dear, you are an orphan, and you have neither brothers nor\nsisters,\" he added hastily.It was just as well to put a final stop to\nquestions as to her family.\"Nobody,\" he reiterated, but he felt like a brute.\"No, no, certainly not,\" he was so embarrassed that he spoke quite\nsharply.She stared at him in amazement and to his disgust\nCyril felt himself turning crimson.\"Now I'm sorry,\" she continued with a soft sigh.\"I--I like them, too,\" he hastened to assure her.Really this was worse\nthan he had expected.\"I have been married four years,\" he truthfully answered, hoping that\nthat statement would satisfy her.Isn't it awful that\nI can only remember you the very weeist little bit!But I will love,\nhonour, and obey you--now that I know--I will indeed.\"\"I am sure you will always do what is right,\" said Cyril with a sudden\ntightening of his throat.She looked so young, so innocent, so serious.Oh, if only----\n\n\"Bah, don't waste too much love on me.I'm an unworthy beggar,\" he said\naloud.She opened her eyes wide and stared\nat him in consternation.\"But it doesn't say anything in the prayer-book\nabout not loving unworthy husbands.I don't believe it makes any\ndifference to the vow before God.Besides you don't look unworthy--are\nyou sure you are?\"Cyril's eyes fell before her agonised gaze.\"I'll try to be worthy of you,\" he stammered.\"I'm too silly and\nstupid now to be anything but a burden--I quite realise that--but the\ndoctor thinks I will get better and in the meantime I will try to please\nyou and do my duty.\"Poor baby, thought Cyril, the marriage vows she imagined she had taken\nseemed to weigh dreadfully on her conscience.Oh, if he could only\nundeceive her!Thompkins has talked enough for the present,\"\nshe said.Cyril rose with a curious mixture of relief and reluctance.\"Well, this must be good-bye for to-day,\" he said, taking her small hand\nin his.She lifted up her face--simply as a child might have done.Slowly he\nleaned nearer to her, his heart was pounding furiously; the blood rushed\nto his temples.For a moment he crushed her fingers to his lips; then turning abruptly,\nhe strode towards the door.\"You'll come to-morrow, won't you?\"I will be so lonely without you,\" she called after\nhim, but he resolutely closed the door.At the foot of the stairs a nurse was waiting for him.\"The doctor would like to speak to you for a moment,\" she said as she\nled the way to the consulting-room.\"Well, how did you find Lady Wilmersley's memory; were you able to help\nher in any way to recall the past,\" inquired the doctor.Cyril was too preoccupied to notice that the other's manner was several\ndegrees colder than it had been on his arrival.Cyril felt guiltily conscious that he was prevaricating.But it\nwill come back to her--I am sure it will.\"\"I say, doctor, how long do you think my wife will have to remain here?\"She could be moved to-morrow, if\nnecessary, but I advise waiting till the day after.\"In fact, the sooner Lady Wilmersley resumes her normal life the\nbetter.\"\"How soon will I be able to talk freely to her?\"\"That depends largely on how she progresses, but not before a month at\nthe earliest.By the way, Lord Wilmersley, I want you to take charge of\nLady Wilmersley's bag.The contents were too valuable to be left about;\nso after taking out her toilet articles, the nurse brought it to me.\"\"Lady Wilmersley's jewels, of course.\"If they were those belonging to his cousin,\ntheir description had been published in every paper in the kingdom.It\nwas a miracle that Smith had not recognised them.\"Of course,\" Cyril managed to stammer.The doctor went to a safe and taking out a cheap, black bag handed it to\nCyril.\"I should like you, please, to see if they are all there,\" he said.\"That isn't the least necessary,\" Cyril hastened to assure him.\"You would greatly oblige me by doing so.\"\"I'm quite sure they are all right; besides if any are missing, they\nwere probably stolen in Paris,\" said Cyril.His keen\neyes had noted Cyril's agitation and his reluctance to open the bag made\nthe doctor all the more determined to force him to do so.Seizing the bag, he made for the door.\"I'll come back to-morrow,\" he cried over his shoulder, as he hurried\nunceremoniously out of the room and out of the house.A disreputable-looking man stood at the door of his waiting taxi and\nobsequiously opened it.Shouting his address to the driver, Cyril flung\nhimself into the car and waved the beggar impatiently away.No sooner were they in motion than Cyril hastened to open the bag.A\nbrown paper parcel lay at the bottom of it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.He undid the string with\ntrembling fingers.Yes, it was as he feared--a part, if not all, of the\nWilmersley jewels lay before him.\"Give me a penny, for the love of Gawd,\" begged a hoarse voice at his\nelbow.The beggar was still clinging to the step and his villainous face\nwas within a foot of the jewels.Cyril felt himself grow cold with apprehension.The fellow knew who he\nwas, and followed him.\"A gen'lman like you could well spare a poor man a penny,\" the fellow\nwhined, but there was a note of menace in his voice.Cyril tried to get\na good look at him, but the light was too dim for him to distinguish his\nfeatures clearly.Hastily covering the jewels, Cyril thrust a coin into the grimy hand.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.he commanded, \"go, or I'll call the police.\"\"My poor little girl, my poor little girl,\" murmured Cyril\ndisconsolately, as he glanced once more at the incriminating jewels.CHAPTER X\n\nTHE TWO FRENCHMEN\n\n\n\"You must be mad, Cyril!No sane man could have got into such a mess!\"cried Guy Campbell, excitedly pounding his fat knee with his podgy hand.Cyril had been so disturbed by the finding of the Wilmersley jewels that\nhe had at last decided that he must confide his troubles to some one.He\nrealised that the time had come when he needed not only advice but\nassistance.He was now so convinced that he was being watched that he\nhad fled to his club for safety.There, at all events, he felt\ncomparatively safe from prying eyes, and it was there in a secluded\ncorner that he poured his tale of woe into his friend's astonished ears.\"If that is all you can find to say, I am sorry I told you,\" exclaimed\nCyril irritably.\"It's a jolly good thing you did!Why, you are no more fit to take care\nof yourself than a new-born baby.\"Guy's chubby face expressed such\ngenuine concern that Cyril relaxed a little.\"Perhaps I've been a bit of an ass, but really I don't see what else I\ncould have done.\"\"No, don't suppose you do,\" said Guy, regarding Cyril with pitying\nadmiration.The question now is not what I ought to have done,\nbut what am I to do now?\"Why, you wouldn't even listen to a sensible\nsuggestion.\"\"To get the girl out of the nursing home and lose her.And it ought to\nbe done P.

Q., as the Americans say.\"\"I know you, Lord Quixote; you\nhave some crazy plan in your head.\"I haven't a plan, I tell you.Now as I am being followed----\"\n\n\"I can't believe you are,\" interrupted Guy.\"I feel sure that that beggar I told you about was a detective.\"\"He was evidently waiting for me and I couldn't shake him off till he\nhad had a good look at the jewels.\"\"It is much more likely that he was waiting for a penny than for you,\nand beggars are usually persistent.I see no possible reason why the\npolice should be shadowing you.It is your guilty conscience that makes\nyou so suspicious.\"\"You may be right; I certainly hope you are, but till I am sure of it, I\ndon't dare to run the risk of being seen with Miss Prentice.As she is\nin no condition to go about alone, I have been worrying a good deal as\nto how to get her out of the Home; so I thought--it occurred to\nme--that--you are the person to do it.\"So you leave me the pleasant task of running off with\na servant-girl who is 'wanted' by the police!\"Miss Prentice is a lady,\" Cyril angrily asserted.\"That she is a beauty I do not\ndoubt, and she has certainly played her cards very skilfully.\"\"Don't you dare to speak of her like that,\" cried Cyril, clenching his\nfists and half starting to his feet.You're smitten with her,\" exclaimed Campbell, staring\naghast at his friend.Cyril flushed darkly under his tan.\"Certainly not, but I have the greatest respect for this unfortunate\nyoung woman, and don't you forget it again.\"Believe what you like, but I didn't think you were the\nsort of man who never credits a fellow with disinterested motives, if he\nbehaves half-way decently to a woman.\"You mustn't take offence so\neasily.I have never seen the young lady, remember.And you know I will\nhelp you even against my better judgment.\"Now let us first of all consider Miss Prentice's case\ndispassionately.I want to be sure of my facts; then I may be able to\nform some conjecture as to why Wilmersley was murdered and how the\njewels came into Miss Prentice's possession.You tell me that it has\nbeen proved that she really left Geralton on the afternoon before the\nmurder?\"\"Yes; the carrier swears he drove her into Newhaven and put her down\nnear the station.Further than that they have luckily not been able to\ntrace her.\"\"Now your idea is that Miss Prentice, having in some way managed to\nsecure a car, returned to Geralton that evening and got into the castle\nthrough the library window?\"\"No, I doubt if she entered the castle.I can think of no reason why she\nshould have done so,\" said Cyril.\"In that case, how do you account for her injuries?Who could have\nflogged her except your charming cousin?\"\"Granting that she is Priscilla Prentice, the only hypothesis I can\nthink of which explains her predicament is this: Having planned to\nrescue her mistress, she was only waiting for a favourable opportunity\nto present itself.The doctor's visit determined her to act at once.I\nagree with you that to re-enter Geralton was not her original intention,\nbut while waiting under the library window for Lady Wilmersley to join\nher, she hears Wilmersley ill-treating his wife, so she climbs in and\nrushes to the latter's assistance.\"\"Yes, yes,\" assented Cyril with shining eyes.\"But she is overpowered by Wilmersley,\" continued Campbell, warming to\nhis theme, \"who, insane with rage, flogs her unmercifully.Then Lady\nWilmersley, fearing the girl will be killed, seizes the pistol, which is\nlying on the desk, and fires at her husband----\"\n\n\"I am convinced that that is just what happened,\" cried Cyril.\"Don't be too sure of it; still, it seems to me that that theory hangs\ntogether pretty well,\" Campbell complacently agreed.\"Of course, neither\nwoman contemplated murder.Wilmersley's death completely unnerved them.If the gardener's wife heard a cry coming from the car, it is possible\nthat one or the other had an attack of hysterics.Now about the\njewels--I believe Miss Prentice took charge of them, either because Lady\nWilmersley was unfit to assume such a responsibility or because they\nagreed that she could the more easily dispose of them.I think that Miss\nPrentice's hurried trip to town was undertaken not in order to avoid\narrest, but primarily to raise money, of which they must have had great\nneed, and possibly also to rejoin her mistress, who, now that we know\nthat she made her escape in a car, is probably hiding somewhere either\nin London itself or in its vicinity.\"You have thought of everything,\" cried Cyril\nadmiringly.\"Of course, I may be quite wrong.These are only suppositions,\nremember,\" Campbell modestly reminded him.\"By the way, what have you\ndone with the jewels?I can't believe that you are in any danger of\narrest, but if there is the remotest chance of such a thing, it wouldn't\nlook very well if they were found in your possession.\"I was even afraid that my rooms might be\nsearched in my absence, so I took them with me.\"I have hidden the bag and to-night I mean to burn\nit.\"\"Your pocket is not a very safe repository.\"That is why I want you to take charge of them,\" said Cyril.\"Oh, very well,\" sighed Campbell, with mock resignation.\"In for a\npenny, in for a pound.I shall probably end by being arrested as a\nreceiver of stolen property!But now we must consider what we had better\ndo with Miss Prentice.\"\"I think I shall hire a cottage in the country for her.\"\"If you did that, the police would find her immediately.The only safe\nhiding-place is a crowd.\"Now let me see: Where is she least likely to attract\nattention?It must be a place where you could manage to see her without\nbeing compromised, and, if possible, without being observed.In a huge caravansary like\nthat all sorts and conditions of people jostle each other without\nexciting comment.Besides, the police are less likely to look among the\nguests of such an expensive hotel for a poor maid servant or in such a\npublic resort for a fugitive from justice.\"\"But in her present condition,\" continued Campbell, \"I don't see how she\ncould remain there alone.\"But what trustworthy woman could you get to undertake such a\ntask?Perhaps one of the nurses----\"\n\n\"No,\" Cyril hastily interrupted him.\"When she leaves the nursing home,\nall trace of her must be lost.At any moment the police may discover\nthat a woman whom I have represented to be my wife has been a patient\nthere.That will naturally arouse their suspicions and they will do\ntheir utmost to discover who it is that I am protecting with my name.For one thing, she would feel called upon to\nreport to the doctor.\"\"You might bribe her not to do so,\" suggested Guy.\"I shouldn't dare to trust to an absolutely unknown quantity.Oh, if I\nonly knew a respectable woman on whom I could rely!I would pay her a\nsmall fortune for her services.\"\"I know somebody who might do,\" said Campbell.\"Her name is Miss Trevor\nand she used to be my sister's governess.She is too old to teach now\nand I fancy has a hard time to make both ends meet.The only trouble is\nthat she is so conscientious that she would rather starve than be mixed\nup in anything she did not consider perfectly honourable and above\nboard.If I told her that she was to chaperon a young lady whom the\npolice were looking for, she would be so indignant that I doubt if she\nwould ever speak to me again.\"\"It doesn't seem decent to inveigle her by false representations into\ntaking a position which she would never dream of accepting if she knew\nthe truth.\"\"I will pay her L200 a year as long as she lives, if she will look after\nMiss Prentice till this trouble is over.Even if the worst happens and\nthe girl is discovered, she can truthfully plead ignorance of the\nlatter's identity,\" urged Cyril.\"True, and two hundred a year is good pay even for unpleasant notoriety.Yes, on the whole I think I am justified in accepting the offer for her.But now we must consider what fairy tale we are going to concoct for her\nbenefit.\"\"Oh, I don't know,\" sighed Cyril wearily.\"Imagination giving out, or conscience awakening--which is it?\"\"Sorry, old man; but joking aside, we must really decide what we are to\ntell Miss Trevor.You can no longer pose as Miss Prentice's husband----\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\"What possible excuse have you for doing so, now that she is to leave\nthe doctor's care?\"\"I am sure it would have a very bad effect on Miss Prentice's health, if\nI were to tell her that she is not my wife.\"\"Remember, she is completely cut off from the past,\" urged Cyril; \"she\nhas neither friend nor relation to cling to.I am the one person in the\nworld she believes she has a claim on.Besides,\nthe doctor's orders are that she shall not be in any way agitated.\"Now what explanation will you give\nMiss Trevor for not living with your wife?\"\"I shall say that her state of health renders it inadvisable for the\npresent.\"\"I think we had better stick to Thompkins.Only we will spell it Tomkyns and change the Christian name to John.\"\"But won't she confide what she believes to be her real name to Miss\nTrevor?\"\"I think not--not if I tell her I don't wish her to do so.She has a\ngreat idea of wifely obedience, I assure you.\"\"Well,\" laughed Guy, \"that is a virtue which so few real wives possess\nthat it seems a pity it should be wasted on a temporary one.And now,\nCyril, we must decide on the best way and the best time for transferring\nMiss Prentice to the hotel.\"\"Unless something unexpected occurs to change our plans, I think she had\nbetter be moved the day after to-morrow.I advise your starting as early\nas possible before the world is well awake.Only be sure you\nare not followed, that is all I ask.\"\"I don't expect we shall be, but if we are, I think I can promise to\noutwit them,\" Campbell assured him.\"I shall never forget what you are doing for me, Guy.\"I expect you to erect a monument commemorating my\nvirtues and my folly.Where are those stolen goods of\nwhich I am to become the custodian?\"I have done them up in several parcels, so that they are\nnot too bulky to carry.As I don't want the police to know how intimate\nwe are, it is better that we should not be seen together in public for\nthe present.\"But perhaps,\" agreed Campbell, \"we might\nas well meet here till all danger is over.\"A few minutes later Cyril also left the club.His talk with Campbell had\nbeen a great relief to him.As he walked briskly along, he felt\ncalm--almost cheerful.\"Isn't this Lord Wilmersley?\"For a moment Cyril was too startled to speak.Then, pulling himself\ntogether, he exclaimed with an attempt at heartiness:\n\n\"Why, Inspector!\"I only left Newhaven this afternoon, but I think my work there is\nfinished--for the present at least.\"\"No indeed, but the clue now leads away from Geralton.\"Cyril found it difficult to control the tremor in his\nvoice.\"If you'll excuse me, my lord, I had better keep my suppositions to\nmyself till I am able to verify them.\"Cyril felt he\ncould not let him go before he had ascertained exactly what he had to\nfear.It was so awful, this fighting in the dark.\"If you have half an hour to spare, come to my rooms.Cyril was convinced that the Inspector knew where he\nwas staying and had been lying in wait for him.He thought it best to\npretend that he felt above suspicion.A few minutes later they were sitting before a blazing fire, the\nInspector puffing luxuriously at a cigar and sipping from time to time a\nglass of whiskey and soda which Peter had reluctantly placed at his\nelbow.Peter, as he himself would have put it, \"did not hold with the\npolice,\" and thought his master was sadly demeaning himself by\nfraternising with a member of that calling.\"I quite understand your reluctance to talk about a case,\" said Cyril,\nreverting at once to the subject he had in mind; \"but as this one so\nnearly concerns my family and consequently myself, I think I have a\nright to your confidence.I am most anxious to know what you have\ndiscovered.I assure you, you can rely\non my discretion.\"\"Well, my lord, it's a bit unprofessional, but seeing it's you, I don't\nmind if I do.It's the newspaper men, I am afraid of.\"\"I shall not mention what you tell me to any one except possibly to one\nfriend,\" Cyril hastily assured him.You see I may be all wrong, so I don't want to say\ntoo much till I can prove my case.\"\"I understand that,\" said Cyril; \"and this clue that you are\nfollowing--what is it?\"he inquired with breathless impatience.\"The car, my lord,\" answered the Inspector, settling himself deeper in\nhis chair, while his eyes began to gleam with suppressed excitement.\"You have found the car in which her ladyship made her escape?\"\"I don't know about that yet, but I have found the car that stood at the\nfoot of the long lane on the night of the murder.\"\"Oh, that's not so very wonderful,\" protested the Inspector with an\nattempt at modesty, but he was evidently bursting with pride in his\nachievement.\"I began my search by trying to find out what cars had been seen in the\nneighbourhood of Geralton on the night of the murder--by neighbourhood I\nmean a radius of twenty-five miles.I", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Most of these turned out to be the property\nof gentlemen who had no difficulty in proving that they had been used\nonly for perfectly legitimate purposes.There remained, however, two\ncars of which I failed to get a satisfactory account.Benedict, a young man who owns a place about ten miles from\nGeralton, and who seems to have spent the evening motoring wildly over\nthe country.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.He pretends he had no particular object, and as he is a bit\nqueer, it may be true.The other car is the property of the landlord of\nthe Red Lion Inn, a very respectable hotel in Newhaven.I then sent two\nof my men to examine these cars and report if either of them has a new\ntire, for the gardener's wife swore that the car she heard had burst\none.Benedict's tires all showed signs of wear, but the Red Lion car\nhas a brand new one!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.\"Oh, that is nothing,\" replied the Inspector, vainly trying to suppress\na self-satisfied smile.\"Did you find any further evidence against this hotel-keeper?\"He knew Lord Wilmersley slightly, but says he has never even seen her\nLadyship.\"In that case what part does he play in the affair?\"You see he keeps the car for the convenience of his\nguests and on the day in question it had been hired by two young\nFrenchmen, who were out in it from two o'clock till midnight.\"But how could they have had anything to do with the\ntragedy?\"So far all I have been able to find out about\nthese two men is that they landed in Newhaven ten days before the\nmurder.They professed to be brothers and called themselves Joseph and\nPaul Durand.They seemed to be amply provided with money and wanted the\nbest the hotel had to offer.Joseph Durand appeared a decent sort of\nfellow, but the younger one drank.The waiters fancy that the elder man\nused to remonstrate with him occasionally, but the youngster paid very\nlittle attention to him.\"\"You say they _professed_ to be brothers.\"For one reason, the elder one did not understand a word of English,\nwhile the young one spoke it quite easily, although with a strong\naccent.That is, he spoke it with a strong accent when he was sober, but\nwhen under the influence of liquor this accent disappeared.\"\"They left Newhaven the morning after the murder.Their departure was\nvery hurried, and the landlord is sure that the day before they had no\nintention of leaving.\"\"Have you been able to trace them farther?\"\"Not yet, my lord, but I have sent one of my men to try and follow them\nup, and I have notified the continental police to be on the look-out for\nthem.It's a pity that they have three days' start of us.\"\"But as you have an accurate description of both, I should imagine that\nthey will soon be found.\"\"It's through the young 'un they'll be caught, if they are caught.\"\"Why, is he deformed in any way?\"\"No, my lord, but they tell me he is abnormally small for a man of his\nage, for he must be twenty-two or three at the very least.The landlord\nbelieves that he is a jockey who had got into bad habits, and that the\nelder man is his trainer or backer.Of course, he may be right, but the\nwaiters pooh-pooh the idea.They insist that the boy is a gentleman-born\nand servants are pretty good judges of such things, though you mightn't\nthink it, my lord.\"\"I can quite believe it,\" assented Cyril.\"But then there are many\ngentlemen jockeys.\"I only wish I had seen the little fellow, for they all\nagree that there was something about him which would make it impossible\nfor any one who had once met him ever to forget him again.\"They also tell me that if his eyes had not been so\nbloodshot, and if he had not looked so drawn and haggard, he'd have been\nan extraordinarily good-looking chap.\"It seems that he has large blue eyes, a fine little nose, not a\nbit red as you would expect, and as pretty a mouth as ever you'd see.His hair is auburn and he wears it rather long, which I don't think he'd\ndo if he were a jockey.Besides, his skin is as fine as a baby's, though\nits colour is a grey-white with only a spot of red in the middle of each\ncheek.\"That's why I think we shall soon spot him.\"He is about twenty-eight years old,\nmedium height, and inclined to be stout.He has dark hair, a little thin\nat the temples, dark moustache, and dark eyes.\"On the night of the murder you say they returned to the hotel at about\nmidnight?\"\"The porter was so sleepy that he can't remember much about it.He had\nan impression that they came in arm in arm and went quietly upstairs.\"\"But what do you think they had done with Lady Wilmersley?\"\"But, my lord, you didn't expect that they would bring her to the hotel,\ndid you?If they were her friends, their first care would be for her\nsafety.If they were not--well, we will have to look for another victim,\nthat is all.\"\"I mustn't\nkeep you any longer.\"He hesitated a moment, eyeing Cyril doubtfully.There was evidently still something he wished to say.Cyril had also risen to his feet and stood leaning against the\nmantelpiece, idly wondering at the man's embarrassment.CHAPTER XI\n\nTHE INSPECTOR INTERVIEWS CYRIL\n\n\nCyril felt the muscles of his face stiffen.He had for days been\ndreading some such question, yet now that it had finally come, it had\nfound him completely unprepared.He must\nfight for her till the last ditch.But how devilishly clever of Griggs to have deferred his attack until he\nwas able to catch his adversary off his guard!Cyril looked keenly but,\nhe hoped, calmly at the Inspector.Their eyes met, but without the clash\nwhich Cyril had expected.The man's expression, although searching, was\nnot hostile; in fact, there was something almost apologetic about his\nwhole attitude.Griggs was not sure of his ground, that much was\nobvious.He knew something, he probably suspected more, but there was\nstill a chance that he might be led away from the trail.Cyril's mind worked with feverish rapidity.He realised that it was\nimperative that his manner should appear perfectly natural.He must first decide what his position,\nviewed from Griggs's standpoint, really was.He must have a definite\nconception of his part before he attempted to act it.The Inspector evidently knew that a young woman, who bore Cyril's name,\nhad been taken ill on the Newhaven train.He was no doubt also aware\nthat she was now under the care of Dr.But if the\nInspector really believed the girl to be his wife, these facts were in\nno way incriminating.He must, therefore, know\nmore of the truth.No, for if he had discovered that the girl was not\nLady Wilmersley, Cyril was sure that Griggs would not have broached the\nsubject so tentatively.He had told every one who inquired about his wife that she\nwas still on the continent.Peter, also, obeying his orders, had\nrepeated the same story in the servants' hall.And, of course, Griggs\nknew that they were both lying.I\nhave not mentioned it to any one.\"Cyril flattered himself that his\nvoice had exactly the right note of slightly displeased surprise.Yes,\nfor Griggs's expression relaxed and he answered with a smile that was\nalmost deprecating:\n\n\"I, of course, saw the report of the man who searched the train, and I\nwas naturally surprised to find that the only lady who had taken her\nticket in Newhaven was Mrs.In a case like this we have\nto verify everything, so when I discovered that the gentleman who was\nwith her, was undoubtedly your Lordship, it puzzled me a good deal why\nboth you and your valet should be so anxious to keep her Ladyship's\npresence in England a secret.\"\"Yes, yes, it must have astonished you, and I confess I am very sorry\nyou found me out,\" said Cyril.The old lie must be\ntold once more.\"Her Ladyship is suffering from a--a nervous affection.\"\"In fact--she has just left an insane asylum,\"\nhe finally blurted out.\"You mean that the present Lady Wilmersley--not the Dowager--?\"The\nInspector was too surprised to finish his sentence.\"Yes, it's queer, isn't it, that both should be afflicted in the same\nway,\" agreed Cyril, calmly lighting a cigarette.\"Most remarkable,\" ejaculated Griggs, staring fixedly at Cyril.\"As the doctors believe that her Ladyship will completely recover, I\ndidn't want any one to know that she had ever been unbalanced.But I\nmight have known that it was bound to leak out.\"\"We are no gossips, my lord; I shall not mention what you have told me\nto any one.\"\"They have got too much to do, to bother about what doesn't concern\nthem.I don't believe a dozen of them noticed that in searching the\ntrain for one Lady Wilmersley, they had inadvertently stumbled on\nanother, and as the latter had nothing to do with their case, they\nprobably dismissed the whole thing from their minds.\"Well, you see, it's different with me.It's the business of my men to\nbring me isolated facts, but I have to take a larger view of\nthe--the--the--ah--possibilities.I have got to think of\neverything--suspect every one.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.\"Your Lordship would have no difficulty in proving an alibi.\"\"So you took the trouble to find that out?\"I should really like to know what could have led you to\nsuspect me?\"You see, Lady\nWilmersley must have had an accomplice and you must acknowledge that it\nwas a strange coincidence that your Lordship should have happened to\npass through Newhaven at that particular moment, especially as the\nNewhaven route is not very popular with people of your means.\"As a matter of fact, I had no intention of taking it, but I\nmissed the Calais train.\"\"I see,\" Griggs nodded his head as if the explanation fully satisfied\nhim.\"Would you mind, my lord,\" he continued after a brief pause, \"if,\nnow that we are on the subject, I asked you a few questions?There are\nseveral points which are bothering me.Of course, don't answer, if you\nhad rather not.\"\"You mean if my answers are likely to incriminate me.Well, I don't\nthink they will, so fire ahead,\" drawled Cyril, trying to express by his\nmanner a slight weariness of the topic.Griggs looked a trifle abashed, but he persisted.\"I have been wondering how it was that you met her Ladyship in Newhaven,\nif you had no previous intention of taking that route?\"The fact is, her Ladyship escaped from an\nasylum near Fontainebleau over a fortnight ago.I scoured France for her\nbut finally gave up the search, and leaving the French detectives to\nfollow up any clue that might turn up, I decided almost on the spur of\nthe moment to run over to England.I was never more astonished than when\nI found her on the train.\"She was rather excited and I asked no questions.\"\"Had she ever before visited Newhaven to your knowledge?\"\"Then she did not know the late Lord Wilmersley?\"inquired the detective, looking keenly\nat Cyril.\"I was never very friendly with my cousin, and we sailed for South\nAfrica immediately after our marriage.Neither of us has been home since\nthen.\"\"I must find out where she spent the night of the murder,\" murmured the\nInspector.\"If you think her Ladyship had anything to do with the tragedy, I assure\nyou, you are on the wrong track,\" cried Cyril, forgetting for a moment\nhis pose of polite aloofness.It is\nchiefly her memory that is affected.Until the last few days what she\ndid one minute, she forgot the next.\"\"You think, therefore, that she would not be able to tell me how she\nspent her time in Newhaven?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.By the way, how has she taken the news of\nLord Wilmersley's murder?\"She does not even know that he is dead.\"\"I see I must explain her case more fully, so that you may be able to\nunderstand my position.Her Ladyship's mind became affected about six\nmonths ago, owing to causes into which I need not enter now.Since her\narrival in England her improvement has been very rapid.Her memory is\ngrowing stronger, but it is essential that it should not be taxed for\nthe present.The doctor assures me that if she is kept perfectly quiet\nfor a month or so, she will recover completely.That is why I want her\nto remain in absolute seclusion.An incautious word might send her off\nher balance.She must be protected from people, and I will protect her,\nI warn you of that.Six weeks from now, if all goes well, you can\ncross-question her, if you still think it necessary, but at present I\nnot only forbid it, but I will do all in my power to prevent it.Of\ncourse,\" continued Cyril more calmly, \"I have neither the power nor the\ndesire to hamper you in the exercise of your profession; so if you doubt\nmy statements just ask Dr.Stuart-Smith whether he thinks her Ladyship\nhas ever been in a condition when she might have committed murder.He\nwill laugh at you, I am sure.\"\"I don't doubt it, my lord; all the same--\" Griggs hesitated.\"All the same you would like to know what her Ladyship did on the night\nof the murder.I assure you that although\nour motives differ, my curiosity equals yours.\"I shall certainly do my best to solve the riddle,\"\nsaid the Inspector as he bowed himself out.Cyril sank wearily into a chair.The interview had been a great strain,\nand yet he felt that in a way it had been a relief also.He flattered\nhimself that he had played his cards rather adroitly.For now that he\nhad found out exactly how much the police knew, he might possibly\ncircumvent them.Of course, it was merely a question of days, perhaps\neven of hours, before Griggs would discover that the girl was not his\nwife; for the Inspector was nothing if not thorough and if he once began\nsearching Newhaven for evidence of her stay there, Cyril was sure that\nit would not take him long to establish her identity.If he only had\nGriggs fighting on his side, instead of the little pompous fool of a\nJudson!By the way, what could have become of Judson?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.It was now two\nfull days since he had left Geralton.He certainly ought to have\nreported himself long before this.Well, it made no difference one way\nor the other.Cyril had no time to think\nof him now.His immediate concern was to find a way by which Priscilla\ncould be surreptitiously removed from the nursing home, before the\npolice had time to collect sufficient evidence to warrant her arrest.Cyril sat for half an hour staring at the\nsmouldering fire before he was able to hit on a plan that seemed to him\nat all feasible.Going to the writing-table, he rapidly covered three sheets and thrust\nthem into an envelope.\"You are to take this letter at half-past seven o'clock to-morrow\nmorning to Mr.Campbell's rooms and give it into his own hands.If he is\nstill asleep, wake him up.You can go to bed now----\"\n\nIt was lucky, thought Cyril, that he had taken Guy into his confidence.For,\nnotwithstanding his careless manner, he was _au fond_ a conventional\nsoul.It was really comical to think of that impeccable person as a\nreceiver of stolen property.What would he do with the jewels, Cyril\nwondered.He must get rid of it at\nonce.Poking the fire into a blaze, he cautiously locked the two doors\nwhich connected his rooms with the rest of the house.Then, having\nassured himself that the blinds were carefully drawn and that no one was\nsecreted about the premises, he knelt down before the empty fireplace in\nhis bedroom and felt up the chimney.CHAPTER XII\n\nA PERILOUS VENTURE\n\n\nIn the grey dawn of the following morning Cyril was already up and\ndressed.The first thing he did was to detach two of the labels affixed\nto his box and place them carefully in his pocketbook.That\naccomplished, he had to wait with what patience he could muster until\nPeter returned with Campbell's reply.It was\nevidently satisfactory, for he heaved a sigh of relief as he sat down to\nbreakfast.His eyes, however, never left the clock and it had hardly\nfinished striking nine before our hero was out of the house.No\nsuspicious person was in sight, but Cyril, was determined to take no\nchances.He therefore walked quickly ahead, then turned so abruptly that\nhe would necessarily have surprised any one who was following him.This\nhe did many times till he reached Piccadilly Circus, where, with a last\nlook behind him, he bolted into a shop.There he asked for a small\ntravelling box suitable for a lady.Having chosen one, he took his\nlabels out of his pocket.\"Have these pasted on the box,\" he ordered.The man's face expressed such amazement that Cyril hastened to remark\nthat the box was intended for a bride who did not wish to be identified\nas such by the newness of her baggage.A comprehending and sympathetic\nsmile proved that the explanation was satisfactory.A few minutes later\nCyril drove off with his new acquisition.The next purchase was a\nhandsomely-fitted lady's dressing-bag, which he took to Trufitt's and\nfilled with such toilet accessories as a much-befrizzled young person\ndesignated as indispensable to a lady's comfort.On leaving there he\nstopped for a moment at his bank.Cyril now metaphorically girded his loins and summoning up all his\ncourage, plunged into a shop in Bond Street, where he remembered his\nmother used to get what she vaguely termed \"her things.\"Among the maze\nof frou-frous he stood in helpless bewilderment, till an obsequious\nfloor-walker came to his rescue.Cyril explained that he had a box\noutside which he wanted to fill then and there with a complete outfit\nfor a young lady.To his relief the man showed no surprise at so unusual\na request and he was soon ensconced in the blessed seclusion of a\nfitting room.There the box was hurriedly packed with a varied\nassortment of apparel, which he devoutly prayed would meet with\nPriscilla's approval.The doctor must have\nleft the nursing home by this time, thought Cyril.Not wishing to attract attention by driving up to the door, he told the\nchauffeur to stop when they were still at some distance away from it.There he got out and looked anxiously about him.To his relief he\nrecognised Campbell's crimson pate hovering in the distance.So far,\nthought Cyril triumphantly, there had been no hitch in his\ncarefully-laid plans.\"You are to wait here,\" he said, turning to the driver, \"for a lady and\na red-haired gentleman.Now understand, no one but a red-haired man is\nto enter this car.Here is a pound, and if you don't make a mess of\nthings, the other gentleman will give you two more.\"\"All right, sir; thank you, sir,\" exclaimed the astonished chauffeur,\ngreedily pocketing the gold piece.Cyril was certain that he had not been followed, and there was no sign\nthat the nursing home was being watched, but that did not reassure him.Those curtained windows opposite might conceal a hundred prying eyes.When he was ushered into Miss Prentice's room, he was surprised to find\nher already up and dressed.She held a mirror in one hand and with the\nother was arranging a yellow wig, which encircled her face like an\naureole.Cyril could hardly restrain a cry of admiration.He had thought\nher lovely before, but now her beauty was absolutely startling.On catching sight of him she dropped the mirror and ran to him with\noutstretched hands.Cyril heroically disengaged himself from her soft, clinging clasp and\nnot daring to allow his eyes to linger on her upturned face, he surveyed\nthe article in question judicially.I can't say, however, that I like anything\nartificial,\" he asserted mendaciously.she cried, and the corners of her mouth began\nto droop in a way he had already begun to dread.Nurse tells me it will take ages and ages for it to grow again.\"\"There, there, my dear, it's all right.You look lovely--\" he paused\nabruptly.This sort of thing must stop, he\ndetermined.\"Then I could afford to have some pretty clothes?\"I can't bear the ones I have on.I can't think why I\never bought anything so ugly.I shall throw them away as soon as I can\nget others.Nurse tells me that I arrived\nhere with nothing but a small hand-bag.\"\"It has gone astray,\" he stammered.\"It will turn up soon, no doubt, but\nin the meantime I have bought a few clothes for your immediate use.\"He must introduce the subject of her\ndeparture tactfully.\"It is waiting a little farther down the street.\"\"Then, believe me, it is necessary for you to leave this place\nimmediately.I--you--are being pursued by some one who--who wishes to\nseparate us.\"\"But how can any one separate us, when\nGod has joined us together?\"\"It's a long story and I have no time to explain it now.All I ask is\nthat you will trust me blindly for the present, and do exactly what I\ntell you to.\"\"I will,\" she murmured submissively.The same middle-aged woman appeared of whom he had caught a glimpse on\nhis former visit.\"I am sorry, but he has just left.\"Cyril knitted his brows as if the doctor's absence was an\nunexpected disappointment.Thompkins must leave here at once and I\nwanted to explain her precipitate departure to him.\"\"Yes, or better still, I shall call at his office.But his absence\nplaces me in a most awkward predicament.\"Cyril paced the room several times as if in deep thought, then halted\nbefore the nurse.As the doctor is not here, I must\nconfide in you.The doctor knows what\nthat is and it was on his advice that we discarded it for the time\nbeing.I can't tell you our reason for this concealment nor why my wife\nmust not only leave this house as soon as possible, but must do so\nunobserved.\"I--I don't know, sir,\" answered the nurse dubiously, staring at Cyril\nin amazement.\"If you will dress my wife in a nurse's uniform and see that she gets\nout of here without being recognised, I will give you L100.The nurse gave a gasp and backed away from the notes, which Cyril held\ntemptingly toward her.\"Oh, I couldn't, sir, really I couldn't.\"I promise you on my word of honour that the doctor need never know that\nyou helped us.\"\"Do you think I am trying to\nbribe you to do something dishonourable?\"Look at my wife, does she look like a criminal, I ask\nyou?\"\"She certainly doesn't,\" answered the nurse, glancing eagerly from one\nto the other and then longingly down at the money in Cyril's hand.\"Well, then, why not trust your instinct in the matter?My wife and I\nhave been placed, through no fault of our own, in a very disagreeable\nposition.You will know the whole story some day, but for the present my\nlips are sealed.International complications might arise if the truth\nleaked out prematurely.\"Cyril felt that the last was a neat touch, for\nthe woman's face cleared and she repeated in an awe-struck voice:\n\"International complications!\"I can say no more,\" added Cyril in a stage whisper.\"One never knows what they will be\nat next.I ought to have known at once that\nit was sure to be all right.Any one can see that you are a gentleman--a\nsoldier, I dare say?\"It is better that you should be able\ntruthfully to plead your complete ignorance.Now as to the uniform; have\nyou one to spare?\"\"All this mystery frightens me,\" exclaimed Priscilla as soon as they\nwere alone.Now listen attentively to what I am saying.On\nleaving here----\"\n\n\"Oh, aren't you going with me?\"\"No, we must not be seen together, but I will join you later.\"\"Very well, now tell me what I am to do.\"\"On leaving this house you are to turn to your right and walk down the\nstreet till you see a taxi with a box on it.A friend of mine, Guy\nCampbell, will be inside.You can easily recognise him; he has red hair.Campbell will drive you to a hotel where a lady is waiting for you and\nwhere you are to stay till I can join you.If there should be any hitch\nin these arrangements, go to this address and send a telegram to me at\nthe club.I have written all this down,\" he said, handing her a folded\npaper.The nurse returned with her arms full of clothes.\"There is a long one attached to the bonnet, but we never pull it over\nour faces, and I am afraid if Mrs.Thompkins did so, it would attract\nattention.\"\"Yet something must be done to conceal her face.\"I used to help in private theatricals once upon\na time.\"I will go downstairs now and wait till you have got\nMrs.\"Give me a quarter of an hour and you will be astonished at the result.\"She seemed to have thrown her whole heart into the business.When Cyril returned, he found Priscilla really transformed.Her yellow\ncurls had been plastered down on either side of her forehead.A pair of\ntinted spectacles dimmed the brilliancy of her eyes and her dark,\nfinely-arched eyebrows had been rendered almost imperceptible by a\nskilful application of grease and powder.With a burnt match the nurse\nhad drawn a few faint lines in the girlish face, so that she looked at\nleast ten years older, and all this artifice was made to appear natural\nby means of a dingy, black net veil.A nurse's costume completed the\ndisguise.I can't thank you enough,\" he exclaimed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.cried Priscilla a little ruefully.You are not\nnoticeable one way or the other.If we are seen, it will be supposed that she is some friend of\nmine who has been calling on me.I will watch till I see her safely in\nthe car,\" the nurse assured him.\"By the way, as I have to pretend not to know of my patient's departure,\nI had better not return till you have left.\"I shall stay here a quarter of an hour so\nas to give you a good start.The next fifteen minutes seemed to Cyril the longest he had ever spent.He did not even dare to follow Priscilla's progress from the window.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Watch in hand he waited till the time was up and then made his way\ncautiously out of the house without, as luck would have it, encountering\nany one.With a light heart Cyril walked briskly\nto the doctor's office.\"Well, Lord Wilmersley, what brings you here?\"But past her heritage of woe and pain,\n    A far more blest millennium shall reign;\n    Seedlings of heroes shall her

but also with the\n   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the\n   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and\n   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English\n   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,\n   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the\n   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick\n   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great\n   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,\n   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of\n   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the\n   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the\n   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the\n   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board\n   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each\n   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few\n   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of\n   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called \"Prairie\n   Geology,\" was selected by President Fillmore, as the first\n   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;\n   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present\n   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so\n   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an\n   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of\n   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the\n   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the\n   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were\n   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the\n   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of\n   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated\n   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;\n   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,\n   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the\n   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of\n   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at\n   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the\n   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not\n   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific\n   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at\n   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them\n   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its\n   main characteristic.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,\n   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal\n   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant\n   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of\n   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being\n   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by\n   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that \"the globe\n   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated\n   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very\n   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its\n   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten\n   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual\n   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly\n   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being\n   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner\n   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also\n   producing all volcanic action.\"The arguments in favor of this\n   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most\n   prominent:\n\n   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous\n   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial\n   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago\n   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most\n   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal\n   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a\n   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of\n   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt\n   in his \"Cosmos.\"_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases\n   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the\n   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must\n   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,\n   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining\n   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been\n   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant\n   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this\n   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that\n   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,\n   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines\n   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one\n   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the\n   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the\n   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred\n   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at\n   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average\n   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in\n   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and\n   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an\n   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in\n   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one\n   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat\n   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree\n   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of\n   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when\n   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed\n   from a common source; and\n\n   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change\n   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less\n   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of\n   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and\n   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees\n   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of\n   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of\n   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could\n   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of\n   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful\ncontrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only\na portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:\n\n   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten\n   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone\n   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the\n   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise\n   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to\n   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that\n   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to\n   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive\n   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by\n   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Turbine wheels were built,\n   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the\n   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between\n   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet\n   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the\n   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the\n   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron\n   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred\n   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of\n   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two\n   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected\n   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron\n   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost\n   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the\n   tunneling through Mount St.Gothard was effected for the Lyons\n   and Turin Railway, just completed.The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an\n   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.This consumed\n   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of\n   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850.But from\n   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the\n   excavation steadily progressed.I neglected to state at the\n   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was\n   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that\n   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the\n   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter\n   fully narrated.As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to\n   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the\n   calculations of the experts.After attaining the depth of fifteen\n   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the\n   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were\n   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio\n   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface\n   downward.Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at\n   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface.As\n   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if\n   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some\n   atheromatous or adiathermic covering.Professor Tyndall was\n   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast\n   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies.As the result of\n   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of\n   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of\n   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon\n   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the\n   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an\n   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,\n   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the\n   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day.The drilling was\n   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the\n   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the\n   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping\n   the drill-point _in situ_.Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a\n   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st\n   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily\n   established.First in importance is the one alluded to above--the\n   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of\n   the earth.This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the\n   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by\n   all the scientists, living or dead.No one had for a moment\n   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a\n   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De\n   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_\n   and not as a ponderable quality.But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse\n   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the\n   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule.Thus, while\n   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred\n   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one\n   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only\n   fifteen thousand feet above that level.This, we know, is owing\n   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a\n   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it.The\n   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being\n   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent.But\n   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere\n   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance\n   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious\n   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward.Its action also was\n   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it\n   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not\n   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at\n   for the time being.As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, \"The hands\n   of the magnetic clock stopped.\"But the activity of the needle\n   gradually increased as the surface was approached.All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the\n   theory, of Professor Faraday, that \"electricity is a force\n   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that\n   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right\n   angles to its current.\"Hence electricity, from the nature of its\n   cause, must be superficial.Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000\n   feet.From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic\n   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite\n   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery\n   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,\n   instead of _igneous_ deposition.As a corollary from the law of\n   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize\n   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was\n   reached in 1869.No amount of heat affected it in the least\n   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest\n   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found\n   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or\n   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.The report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of\nthe earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only\ntruncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the\nlatitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg.The concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the\n   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover\n   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the\n   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two\n   years.However, important results had been obtained, and a\n   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the\n   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks.In fact, the enormous\n   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured\n   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the\n   floor of the shaft building!<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.The highest peak of the Himalayas is\n   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that\n   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the\n   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November\n   1.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages\n   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the\n   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were\n   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from\n   cyncope.Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent\n   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon\n   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar.But the miners went\n   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as\n   human endurance could bear it.But this was not to be much\n   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible\n   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco\n   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of\n   asphyxia.The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,\n   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials\n   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in\n   the flames.At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another\n   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more\n   than 1000 feet at the other end.The detonations became more\n   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,\n   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice.A\n   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,\n   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious\n   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into\n   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one\n   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the\n   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and\n   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and\n   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and\n   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on\n   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty\n   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the\n   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed\n   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire\n   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed\n   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were\n   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and\n   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the\n   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after\n   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,\n   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it\n   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this\n   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,\n   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted\n   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders\n   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he\n   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded\n   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate\n   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they\n   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,\n   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the\n   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are\n   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a\n   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the\n   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the\n   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils\n   are almost incalculable.The Belgian Government was duly notified\n   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous\n   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the\n   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was\n   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference\n   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest\n   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could\n   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the\n   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,\n   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the\n   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their\n   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant\n   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the\n   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But\n   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,\n   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from\n   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could\n   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this\n   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been\n   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established\n   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost\n   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the\n   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most\n   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose\n   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the\n   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in\n   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the\n   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the\n   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on\n   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of\n   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff\n   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the\n   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only\n   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action.\"There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of,\" said he,\n   \"and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving\n   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly\n   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a\n   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim\n   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever\n   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active\n   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently\n   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes.\"Palmieri then asked the speaker \"if he wished to be understood as\n   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being\n   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law\n   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could\n   rise?\"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: \"I dissent _in toto_ from\n   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I\n   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and\n   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw\n   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can\n   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to\n   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts\n   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the\n   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent\n   center and fly off into surrounding space.\"M. Gassiot replied, \"that true volcanoes were supplied by nature\n   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their\n   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no\n   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could\n   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he\n   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all\n   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size.\"Palmieri again responded, \"that he had no doubt but that the\n   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up\n   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,\n   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds\n   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply\n   ridiculous.\"Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited\n   tone, when Prof.Palmieri \"disclaimed any intention of personal\n   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint.\"He then\n   proceeded: \"The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level\n   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than\n   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich\n   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It\n   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true\n   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten\n   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when\n   controlled by the moon.\"It was seen at once that the scientists\n   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its\n   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the\n   close of the session, the members were equally divided between\n   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take\n   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed\n   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and\n   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as\n   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the\n   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet\n   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about\n   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is\n   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch\n   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and\n   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of\n   the United States in originating the work that led to the\n   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign\n   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State\n   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum\n   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States\n   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by\n   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,\n   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the\n   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\n                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,\n                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did\n   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory\n   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and\n   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his\n   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that \"Holland,\n   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of\n   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the\n   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the\n   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of\n   basalt.\"The reason given was this: \"That lava must continue to\n   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic\n   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the\n   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's\n   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of\n   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great\n   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created\n   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained\n   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as\n   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of\n   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw\n   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic\n   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a\n   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome.\"In concluding his\n   remarks, he ventured the prediction that \"the North Sea would be\n   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected\n   with the Continent.\"_WILDEY'S DREAM._\n\n\n    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,\n          Just fifty years ago,\n    And struck in his might, to the left and right,\n          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star\n          Illumined the dusky air,\n    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,\n          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,\n          Just fifty years ago,\n    Of the sins that start in the human heart\n          When _its_ metal is all aglow;\n    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,\n          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,\n    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs\n          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,\n          With center in self alone,\n    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,\n          In the sweep of its mighty zone;\n    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,\n          He gazed from his swarthy home,\n    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,\n          That covered the world with its dome!'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march\n          All peoples went wailing by,\n    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,\n          To the grave that was yawning nigh,\n    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows\n          On the iron that was aglow,\n    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,\n          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,\n    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;\n    Men of all nations, and of every clime,\n    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,\n    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,\n    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band\n    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;\n    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,\n    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,\n    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose\n    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;\n    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,\n    With tombs inscribed--\"Here lies a realm of slaves.\"Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,\n    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,\n    By bold S", "question": "Where is Daniel?

sorrow filled his breast;\n    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,\n    \"Come!\"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,\n    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;\n    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,\n    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.Again he stood at his anvil good\n      With an angel by his side,\n    And rested his sledge on its iron edge\n      And blew up his bellows wide;\n    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,\n      Then murmured in accent low:\n    \"All ready am I your bidding to try\n      So far as a mortal may go.\"'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,\n      And breathed in his softest tone,\n    \"Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air\n

night groweth late, but here will I wait\n      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;\n    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,\n      And search with _my_ angel eyes.\"The dreamer once more passed the open door,\n      But plumed for an angel's flight;\n    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled\n      When the clouds are alive with light;\n    He followed the sun till his race was won,\n      And probed every heart and mind;\n    But in every zone man labored alone\n      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,\n      The dreamer returned to his home,\n    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,\n      Besprinkled with dew and foam.\"The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught\n      In the flame that is all aglow.\"\"No heart could I find that was true to its kind,\n      So I left all the world in its woe.\"Then the stern angel cried: \"In your own throbbing side\n      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;\n    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife\n      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?\"\"Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,\n      And sinful my sorrowing heart;\n    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,\n      With life I am willing to part.\"Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast\n      To the angel's glittering blade;\n    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide\n      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,\n      And buried it deep in

Beat the heart that was all aglow,\n    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars\n      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge\n      Of wounds that were

 And cried at each blow, \"Strike high!\"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought\n      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;\n    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,\n      _But

FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke\n      At the anvil that slept by his side;\n    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,\n      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,\n      Our emblem in age and in youth;\n    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,\n      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._\n\n\nBy pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the\nvagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of\nloveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive\nin the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up\nto the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us\nfrom the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the\nimperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous\ntruth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as\nwe unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in\ncreation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the\nmighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,\na boiling flood of lava.Time was not;\nfor as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun\nhad not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure\nconcave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but\nshot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their\nhorrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not \"moved upon the face of\nthe waters,\" and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable\ndepths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,\ndestined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the\nlaws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned\nupon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and\nwater overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting\npinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and\ndecomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This\nbut prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the\ngroundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of\nall her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet\naffections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God\ncalls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and\ncommences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his\nsway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven\nthrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme\nof the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and\nanxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous\nword--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of\nTelegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the\nwest, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa\nhills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand\nproblem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea\nof silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of\nthe setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay\nlike a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at\nintervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of\nbusiness I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since\ngrated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the\nnight.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my\nprofession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to\nthe cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their\nthraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought\ncame back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in\nletters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,\nwith its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy\ncame with her republics, her \"starry\" Galileo, and her immortal\nBuonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her\nNapoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her\ncommerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld\nNewton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw\nRussell expiring on the scaffold.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.But ever and anon a pale,\nthorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a\ncross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but\nspeechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open\non my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would\nthen pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and\nher apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and\nwent like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in\nglittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow\nencircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud\nabove of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled\nand subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth's physical history also swept by in full\nreview.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no\nmeans uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I\nseemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,\nread or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide\nheavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an\nimmense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides\nI saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in\ndeep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its\nsummit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in\nalternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: \"_Granite_, _Liquid_,\n_Gas_, _Electricity_;\" on another, \"_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,\n_Human_;\" on the third side, \"_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,\n_Imagination_;\" and on the fourth, \"_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,\n_Love_.\"At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the\nbase of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot\nupon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught\na distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and\nswarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly\nupward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and\nI observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second\nlayer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me\nfor observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily\nrecognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he\nreached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I\ncaught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high\nforehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of\nthe true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,\nand that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in\nreality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced\nfrom the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with\nfolded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as\nif about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in\ndistinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen\nto my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because\nunanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral\nsound of my voice.\"Home,\" responded a tiny voice at my side, and\nturning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little\nschool-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached\nme unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I\nspoke.\"Yes, little daughter,\" replied I, \"'tis time to proceed\nhomeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the\nevening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home,\" and taking\nher proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still\nringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #\n\nMidnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The\ncandle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering\nglimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber\nvisited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and\nexcited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart\nand brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now\nperceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were\ndense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me\nhowling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving\nbillows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his\ndoubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his\npoison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all\nthe great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the\nsame thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and\nas I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and\nagain--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart\nfrom Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed\nher into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No\ncoquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are\nwoven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits\nimpassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The\nlight she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the\nbright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the\nsoul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the\nscene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its\nlessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was\ncased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an\nocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of\nan angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my\nconscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my\nmental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of\nthe straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the\npoor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely\nglancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable\npassage in one of Paul's epistles: \"That was not _first_ which is\nspiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is\nspiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but\nwe shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the\nlast trump.\"Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection\nthan at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the\nhorizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that\nthe past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the\nhuman soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the\nprophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,\nand read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul\nevidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its\napplicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in\nphilosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;\nthat man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of\nHis creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is\nbarren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,\nhe clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science\nis demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first\nlaw, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone\nforth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up\nlike a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that\nthe shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that\npoor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in\nthought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had\nwandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it\nwould be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had\nbeen identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually\ndecipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral\napparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by\nmortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of\nthe mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and\nbear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the\ntelescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered\nby the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin\nbeheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to\ntheir bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,\nand he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so\nlong tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most\nunwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be\ncalled sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more\npowerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst\nmy eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and\nalmost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking\nsong flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose\nshadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I\nbeheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree\nwhich was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the\nbranches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its\nsilken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,\nspreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding\nthis, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of\nTelegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It\nwas in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and\nthe identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the\ntop.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or\ngreets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are\nwhistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her\nsides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many\nmoments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it\ncovered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and\nfertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then\ncame forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the\nmorn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at\nJerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker\nthan the transformation which now overspread the earth.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.In a second of\ntime it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes\ntoward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his\nposition, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to\nbe floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His\nfeatures were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression\nof superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the\nquestion came forth the response, \"I am.\"But, inquired my mind, for my\nlips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again\nI read in his features the answer, \"For ages this earth existed as a\nnatural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;\ngradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that\nwhich transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the\nbutterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now\ngleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed\nas naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets\nand apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind\ninfatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your\nown mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the\nidea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and\ndismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year\nallotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as\nscience elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,\nthe natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be\nchanged in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear\nthe clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration.\"Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the\ndark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my\nheart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When\nthe morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent\nand abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,\nbut thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the\nclouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its\nwings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when\nin terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._\n\n\n                   I.\n\n    A dozen

occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged\nheavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose\nstate.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder\nsleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician\nwith joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss\nLucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused\nme from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something\nof the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared\nas fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my\nshattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after\nmy awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no\ntorpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the\noccurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had\nhappened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my\nintended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I\nwas awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I\nsmiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all\napprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late\ncatastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand\ntimes, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,\nremembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he\nrushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome\nintelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild\nwith joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and\nforehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,\nand had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my\nchamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the\nnurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the\nreader's eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything\naround me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when\nconsciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and\ninstead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at\nmy bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she\nmight select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual\nmanner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most\nimplicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark\nin relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what\ndelighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a\nmanuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its\nhistory.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for\nmy brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day\ncame round, instead of \"hammering away,\" as he called it, on moral\nessays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled\n\n\nTHE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old\ntoper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great\nmany very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard\nof, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of\n\"Teutonic pluck\" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the\ndisplay of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was\nhis strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He\nhad told me, in confidence, that \"many a time and oft\" he had rolled\nincessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once\nrolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to\neat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,\nthe fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might\naccidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically\nthat such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very\nlong fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great\nSahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must\nnot episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the\nlittle town", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "His\ncompanions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and\ngazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,\ncould nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the\npins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal\nhad a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start\nhome.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and\nthe heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever\nheard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down\ntremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set\nout.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he\nhad but a boy to talk to!A verse\nthat he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into\nhis mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire\nits company.for the might of dread Odin\n       The powers upon him shed,\n     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]\n       And a talk with Mimir's head!\"[B-236]\n\n[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could\nsail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and\ncarry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin.When he\ndesired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired\nof Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,\nhowever, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,\nuntil finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that\nit drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven\ntimes, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and\ndemanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, \"What do _you_\nwant with Odin?\"\"Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,\"\npolitely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head\nwas followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least\nforty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in\nclose proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he\ncould, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, \"Now I lay me\ndown to sleep,\" etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal\nsaid--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it\nmight, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,\n\"Stand up!\"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took\ntheir places.There has appeared, however, a new claimant for the\nplace--one that possesses all the qualities that go to make a social\nfavorite, and has the additional advantages of greater ease of\nexecution, and wider possibilities of adaptation.This is the BOSTON--not, as many persons suppose, a new creation nor\nindeed is it a novelty even to the American public, for it was\nintroduced here more than a generation ago; but the great popularity of\nthe Two-Step, which had just then come into vogue, and was fast gaining\nfavor under the influence of such brilliant compositions as the\nquick-step marches by Sousa, operated against its immediate acceptance.One of the reasons why the Boston should prove today a more attractive\ndance than any other, is the fact that now there are more captivating\nairs written for this particular form of dance than for any other, and\nas the Two-Step, in its time, found its most powerful ally in the music\nto which it was adapted, the Boston has today the persuasive\nintercession of such languorous and haunting melodies as \"Love's\nAwakening\" and \"On the Wings of Dream,\" by Danglas; Sinibaldi's\n\"Thrill,\" and others.General taste has gradually found out the superior charm of the Boston;\nthe pendulum of public favor has again swung in the direction of skilful\ndancing.The recent revival of the Waltz in its proper form, has brought with it\na larger appreciation of the more worthy and graceful social dances,\nand the entire world now recognizes the wonderful beauty of the Boston,\nand has welcomed it as a real competitor.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.The Boston is not a Waltz, yet it is the perfection of it.It is one of\nthose paradoxical things which, while it is impossible to be classified,\ncontains all that is to be found in almost any other dance.Even the\npersons who have so long and so loyally clung to other forms of dancing,\nand have abated none in their zeal for their favorites, have been\nunconsciously, and perhaps unwillingly, charmed by the seductiveness of\nthe Boston, until they now freely declare the new dance to be the\nsuperior of the Waltz.Therefore it is safe to say that the Boston will,\neventually, supersede the Waltz altogether.We demand a dance which combines ease of execution with attractive\nmovement.That is just what the Boston does, and perhaps more.It is so\nsimple in construction that, when acquired, it becomes natural, and its\nperfect adaptability assures it lasting popularity.Owing to the urgent request of many of his pupils and colleagues, the\nauthor has undertaken this little book in the hope that it will meet the\nrequirements of both teachers and students, and help to assure the\nproper appreciation of what is in reality the most delightful and\nartistic social dance since the Minuet.THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL POSITIONS\n\nIn order that the reader may the more readily understand the\ndescriptions given in this book, we will explain the five fundamental\npositions upon which the art of dancing rests.In the 1st position, the feet are together, heel against heel.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 2nd position, the heels are separated sidewise, and on the same\nline.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 3rd position, the heel of one foot touches the middle of the\nother.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 4th position, the feet are separated as in walking, either\ndirectly forward or directly backward.[Illustration]\n\nIn the 5th position, the heel of one foot touches the point of the\nother.[Illustration]\n\nIn all these positions the feet must be turned outward to form not less\nthan a right angle.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTNERS\n\nMuch, if not all, of the adverse criticism of the Boston which has been\noffered by educators, parents and other responsible objectors, has been\ndirected at the relative positions of the partners.This is, in fact, no\nmore than the general rule as regards the Social Round Dance, with the\npossible exception that the positions have been sometimes distorted by\nattempts to copy the freer forms of dancing that have been presented\nupon the stage.The Round Dance demands that a certain fixed grouping of the partners be\nmaintained in order that the rotation around a common moving centre may\nbe accomplished, and it is here that the most serious problem is to be\nfound.The dancing profession long ago undertook to settle upon arbitrary\ngroupings satisfactory to the needs of the dancers, and conforming to\nall the requirements of propriety and hygienic exercise.[Illustration]\n\nActing upon this basis, the reputable teachers of dancing throughout the\nworld have adopted and promulgated three fundamental groupings for the\nRound Dance which are so constructed as to provide the greatest ease of\nexecution and freedom of action.They are known as the Waltz Position,\nthe Open Position, and the Side Position of the Waltz.All round dances\nare executed in one or another of these groupings, which are not only\naccepted by all good teachers, but, with the exception of certain minor\nand unimportant variations, rigidly adhered to in all their work.In the Waltz Position the partners stand facing one another, with\nshoulders parallel, and looking over one another's right shoulder.Special attention must be paid to the parallel position of the\nshoulders, in order to fit the individual movements of the partners\nalong the line of direction.The gentleman places his right hand lightly upon the lady's back, at a\npoint about half-way across, between the waist-line and the\nshoulder-blades.The fingers are so rounded as to permit the free\ncirculation of air between the palm of the hand and the lady's back, and\nshould not be spread.The lady places her left hand lightly upon the gentleman's arm, allowing\nher fore-arm to rest gently upon his arm.The partners stand at an easy\ndistance from one another, inclining toward the common centre very\nslightly.The free hands are lightly joined at the side.This is merely\nto provide occupation for the disengaged arms, and the gentleman holds\nthe tip of the lady's hand lightly in the bended fingers of his own.Guiding is accomplished by the gentleman through a slight lifting of his\nright elbow.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE OPEN POSITION\n\nThe Open Position needs no explanation, and can be readily understood\nfrom the illustration facing page 8.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.THE SIDE POSITION OF THE WALTZ\n\nThe side position of the Waltz differs from the Waltz Position only in\nthe fact that the partners stand side by side and with the engaged arms\nmore widely extended.The free arms are held as in the frontispiece.In\nthe actual rotation this position naturally resolves itself into the\nregular Waltz Position.THE STEP OF THE BOSTON\n\nThe preparatory step of the Boston differs materially from that of any\nother Social Dance.There is _only one position_ of the feet in the\nBoston--the 4th.That is to say, the feet are separated one from the\nother as in walking.On the first count of the measure the whole leg swings freely, and as a\nunit, from the hip, and the foot is put down practically flat upon the\nfloor, where it immediately receives the entire weight of the body\n_perpendicularly_.The weight is held entirely upon this foot during the\nremainder of the measure, whether it be in 3/4 or 2/4 time.The following preparatory exercises must be practiced forward and\nbackward until the movements become natural, before proceeding.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.In going backward, the foot must be carried to the rear as far as\npossible, and the weight must always be perpendicular to the supporting\nfoot.These movements are identical with walking, and except the particular\ncare which must be bestowed upon the placing of the foot on the first\ncount of the measure, they require no special degree of attention.On the second count the free leg swings forward until the knee has\nbecome entirely straightened, and is held, suspended, during the third\ncount of the measure.This should be practiced, first with the weight\nresting upon the entire sole of the supporting foot, and then, when this\nhas been perfectly accomplished, the same exercise may be supplemented\nby raising the heel (of the supporting foot) on the second count and\nlowering it on the third count._Great care must be taken not to divide\nthe weight._\n\nFor the purpose of instruction, it is well to practice these steps to\nMazurka music, because of the clearness of the count.[Illustration]\n\nWhen the foregoing exercises have been so fully mastered as to become,\nin a sense, muscular habits, we may, with safety, add the next feature.This consists in touching the floor with the point of the free foot, at\na point as far forward or backward as can be done without dividing the\nweight, on the second count of the measure.Thus, we have accomplished,\nas it were, an interrupted, or, at least, an arrested step, and this is\nthe true essence of the Boston.Too great care cannot be expended upon this phase of the step, and it\nmust be practiced over and over again, both forward and backward, until\nthe movement has become second nature.All this must precede any attempt\nto turn.The turning of the Boston is simplicity itself, but it is, nevertheless,\nthe one point in the instruction which is most bothersome to\nlearners.The turn is executed upon the ball of _the supporting foot_,\nand consists in twisting half round without lifting either foot from the\nground.In this, the weight is held altogether upon the supporting foot,\nand there is no crossing.In carrying the foot forward for the second movement, the knees must\npass close to one another, and care must be taken that _the entire half\nturn comes upon the last count of the measure_.To sum up:--\n\nStarting with the weight upon the left foot, step forward, placing the\nentire weight upon the right foot, as in the illustration facing page 14\n(count 1); swing left leg quickly forward, straightening the left knee\nand raising the right heel, and touch the floor with the extended left\nfoot as in the illustration facing page 16, but without placing any\nweight upon that foot (count 2); execute a half-turn to the left,\nbackward, upon the ball of the supporting (right) foot, at the same time\nlowering the right heel, and finish as in the illustration opposite page\n18 (count 3).[Illustration]\n\nStarting again, this time with the weight wholly upon the right foot,\nand with the left leg extended backward, and the point of the left foot\nlightly touching the floor, step backward, throwing the weight entirely\nupon the left foot which sinks to a position flat upon the floor, as\nshown in the illustration facing page 21, (count 4); carry the right\nfoot quickly backward, and touch with the point as far back as possible\nupon the line of direction without dividing the weight, at the same time\nraising the left heel as in the illustration facing page 22, (count 5);\nand complete the rotation by executing a half-turn to the right,\nforward, upon the ball of the left foot, simultaneously lowering the\nleft heel, and finishing as in the illustration facing page 24, (count\n6).THE REVERSE\n\nThe reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the\nrotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to\nalternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the\nturning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of\nalternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see\npreparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the\ngentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole\nturn.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the\nturn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,\nand in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,\nthan that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure\nto reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised\nuntil one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The\nwriter has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only\nhelpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in\nobviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent\nunpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]\n\nAfter acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to\nMazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of\nSpanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more\nliquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of\nDanglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is\nalways opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,\nthe weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the\nweight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the\ndancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be\nheld back, instead of inclining slightly forward as in the other round\ndances.This seeming contradiction of forces lends to the Boston a\nunique charm which is to be found in no other dance.As the dancer becomes more familiar with the Boston, the movement\nbecomes so natural that little or no thought need be paid to technique,\nin order to develop the peculiar grace of it.The fact of its being a dance altogether in one position calls for\ngreater skill in the execution of the Boston, than would be the case if\nthere were other changes and contrasts possible, just as it is more\ndifficult to play a melody upon a violin of only one string.The Boston, in its completed form, resolves itself into a sort of\nwalking movement, so natural and easy that it may be enjoyed for a\nwhole evening without more fatigue than would be the result of a single\nhour of the Waltz and Two-Step.Aside from the attractiveness of the Boston as a social dance, its\nphysical benefits are more positive than those of any other Round Dance\nthat we have ever had.The action is so adjusted as to provide the\nmaximum of muscular exercise and the minimum of physical effort.This\ntends towards the conservation of energy, and produces and maintains, at\nthe same time an evenness of blood pressure and circulation.The\nmovements also necessitate a constant exercise of the ankles and insteps\nwhich is very strengthening to those parts, and cannot fail to raise and\nsupport the arch of the foot.Taken from any standpoint, the Boston is one of the most worthy forms of\nthe social dance ever devised, and the distortions of position which\nare now occasionally practiced must soon give way to the genuinely\nrefining influence of the action.[Illustration]\n\nOf the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond\nthe description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated\nin the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete\nunderstanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further\nthe proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady's\npart.The gentleman's is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._\n\n\nTHE LONG BOSTON\n\nThe ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is\ncommonly known as the \"Long\" Boston to distinguish it from other forms\nand variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and\nat any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it\nshould be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE SHORT BOSTON\n\nThe \"Short\" Boston differs from the \"Long\" Boston only in measure.It is\ndanced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)\noccupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements\neach occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between\nthe \"Long\" and the \"Short\" Boston the same difference as between the\nWaltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the \"Short\" Boston, the\nrising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take\nthe form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less\nfatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON\n\nThe \"Open\" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first\npart is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages\n8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the \"Long\"\nBoston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,\nwithout turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to\nface directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the\nposition shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one\nBoston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz\nPosition for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE BOSTON DIP\n\nThe \"Dip\" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4\nmeasures of the \"Long\" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:\n\nStanding upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the\nweight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in\nfront of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);\nlower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original\nplace where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across\nin front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the\nleft heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side\nof the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across\nin front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down\nthe left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it\n(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and\nfinish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives\nthe weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the\nmovement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly\ncoincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TURKEY TROT\n\n_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._\n\n\nDuring the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning\n(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,\nstretch the free foot backward, (lady's left, gentleman's right) as\nshown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady's right, gentleman's left)\nswaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and\npointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *\n\n  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in \"The Gobbler\" by\n  J. Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE\n\n\nThe \"Aeroplane Glide\" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed\nto represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its\nname from that fact.The sole difference between the \"Dip\" and \"Aeroplane\" consists in the\nsix running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running\nsteps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before\nand behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure\nrequires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is\nnoticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the \"Dip\".[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TANGO\n\n\nThe Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the\npeculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends\nlargely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the\nmusic as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,\nand the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend\nthemselves most readily to verbal description.1\n\nThe partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes\nthe lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full\nextent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand\nupon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration\nopposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and\nsteps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows\nforward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing\none foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same\ndirection.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the\nwhole is repeated at will.2\n\nThis variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman\ntakes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two\nsteps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two\nsteps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as\nthe feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the\nwhole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE \"BOSTON\"\n\n\nPIANO SOLO\n\n(_Also to be had

MASS.TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\n\n\n  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.According to the regulations, is it\nhis duty to call _first_ on the Superintendent?--that's the point.\"\"However, the Superintendent has a copy\nof the letter, and he will know the ropes.We will wait a day, then, if\nhe's quiescent, it's up to us.\"\"You should have been a diplomat,\nCroyden--nothing less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!\"\"A motor boat would be mighty convenient to go back and forth to\nAnnapolis,\" he said.\"Look at the one cutting through the water there,\nmidway across!\"It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep water, and an officer\nin uniform swept the tents and them with a glass.Then the boat put\nabout and went chugging upstream.\"We didn't seem to please him,\" remarked Macloud, gazing after the\nboat.Suddenly it turned in toward shore and made the landing at the\nExperiment Station.\"We are about to be welcomed or else ordered off--I'll take a bet\neither way,\" said Macloud.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.\"Otherwise, they wouldn't have\ndespatched an officer--it would have been a file of marines instead.You haven't lost the permit, Macloud!\"Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly down the roadway.As\nsoon as he sighted the tents, he swung over toward them.Macloud went a\nfew steps forward to meet him.\"Senator Rickrose isn't coming until later.I am\none of his friends, Colin Macloud, and this is Mr.\"The\nSuperintendent presents his compliments and desires to place himself\nand the Academy at your disposal.\"(He was instructed to add, that\nCaptain Boswick would pay his respects to-morrow, having been called to\nWashington to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence of the\nChairman of the Naval Affairs Committee rendered it unnecessary.)\"Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose and us, and tell him we\nappreciate his kindness exceedingly,\" Macloud answered.\"We're camping\nhere for a week or so, to try sleeping in the open, under sea air.Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed.\"So far, we're making delightful progress,\" said Croyden; \"but there\nare breakers ahead when Hook-nose and his partner get in the game.Suppose we inspect the premises and see if they have been here in our\nabsence.\"They went first to the place where they had seen them conceal the\ntools--these were gone; proof that the thieves had paid a second visit\nto the Point.But, search as they might, no evidence of work was\ndisclosed.\"Not very likely,\" replied Macloud, \"with half a million at stake.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.They\nprobably are seeking information; when they have it, we shall see them\nback again.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.\"Suppose they bring four or five others to help them?\"\"They won't--never fear!--they're not sharing the treasure with any one\nelse.Rather, they will knife each other for it.Honor among thieves is\nlike the Phoenix--it doesn't exist.\"\"If the knifing business were to occur before the finding, it would\nhelp some!\"\"Meantime, I'm going to look at the ruins\nof the light-house.I discovered in an almanac I found in the hotel\nlast night, that the original light-house was erected on Greenberry\nPoint in 1818.They went out to the extreme edge, and stood gazing across the shoals\ntoward the ruins.\"What do you make the distance from the land?\"\"About one hundred yards--but it's very difficult to estimate over\nwater.It may be two hundred for all I can tell.\"\"It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two feet from the Point to the\nnear side of the ruins,\" said Croyden.\"Why not three hundred and twenty-two and a half feet!\"\"I measured it this morning while you were dawdling over your\nbreakfast,\" answered Croyden.\"Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I suppose.\"\"Not exactly; I measured it on the Government map of the Harbor.It\ngives the distance as three hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain\nfigures.\"\"Now, what's the rest\nof the figures--or haven't you worked it out?\"\"The calculation is of value only on the\nassumption--which, however, is altogether reasonable--that the\nlight-house, when erected, stood on the tip of the Point.It is now\nthree hundred and twenty-two feet in water.Therefore, dividing\nninety-two--the number of years since erection--into three hundred and\ntwenty-two, gives the average yearly encroachment of the Bay as three\nand a half feet.Parmenter buried the casket in 1720, just a hundred\nand ninety years ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by three and\na half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five feet.In other words, the\nPoint, in 1720, projected six hundred and sixty-five feet further out\nin the Bay than it does to-day.\"\"Then, with the point moved in six hundred and sixty-five feet\nParmenter's beeches should be only eighty-five feet from the shore\nline, instead of seven hundred and fifty!\"\"As the Point from year to year slipped\ninto the Bay, the fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake,\ngradually ate into the timber.It is seventy years, at least, since\nParmenter's beeches went down.\"\"Why shouldn't the Duvals have noticed the encroachment of the Bay, and\nmade a note of it on the letter?\"\"Probably, because it was so gradual they did not observe it.They,\nlikely, came to Annapolis only occasionally, and Greenberry Point\nseemed unchanged--always the same narrow stretch of sand, with large\ntrees to landward.\"\"Next let us measure back eighty-five feet,\" said Croyden, producing a\ntape-line.... \"There!this is where the beech tree should stand.But\nwhere were the other trees, and where did the two lines drawn from them\nintersect?\"...said Macloud--\"where were the trees, and where\ndid the lines intersect?You had a compass yesterday, still got\nit?\"Macloud drew it out and tossed it over.\"I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams last night, and they\ndisclosed a peculiar thing.With the location of the first tree fixed,\nit matters little where the others were, in determining the direction\nof the treasure.The _objective point_ will\nchange as you change the position of the trees, but the _direction_\nwill vary scarcely at all.It is self-evident, of course, to those who\nunderstand such things, but it was a valuable find for me.Now, if we\nare correct in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is buried----\"\n\nHe opened the compass, and having brought North under the needle, ran\nhis eye North-by-North-east.A queer look passed over his face, then he\nglanced at Macloud and smiled.\"The treasure is buried,\" he repeated--\"the treasure is buried--_out in\nthe Bay_.\"\"Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult,\" he said dryly.Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they measured to the low\nbluff at the water's edge.\"Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here,\" he said, \"and Parmenter\nburied the treasure at three hundred and thirty feet--therefore, it's\nforty-eight feet out in the Bay.\"\"Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter's time, the Bay has not\nonly encroached on the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.\"\"It's hard to dig in water,\" Macloud remarked.\"It's apt to fill in the\nhole, you know.\"\"Don't be sarcastic,\" Croyden retorted.\"I'm not responsible for the\nBay, nor the Point, nor Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the\nfool quest, please remember.\"\"Except the present measurements and the theory on which they're\nbased,\" Macloud replied.\"And as the former seem to be accurate, and\nthe latter more than reasonable, we'd best act on them.\"\"At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies either in the Bay, or\nclose on shore; if so, we have relieved ourselves from digging up the\nentire Point.\"\"You have given us a mighty plausible start,\" said Macloud.as a\nbuggy emerged from among the timber, circled around, and halted before\nthe tents.\"It is Hook-nose back again,\" said Macloud.\"Come to pay a social call,\nI suppose!\"They're safe--I put them under the blankets.\"\"Come to treat with us--to share the treasure.\"By this time, they had been observed by the men in the buggy who,\nimmediately, came toward them.said Croyden, and they sauntered\nalong landward.\"And make them stop us--don't give the least indication that we know\nthem,\" added Macloud.As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden glanced carelessly at the\noccupants, and were about to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the\nhorse over in front of them.\"Which of you men is named Croyden?\"\"Well, you're the man we're lookin' for.Geoffrey is the rest of your\nhandle, isn't it?\"\"You have the advantage of me,\"", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "\"Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your name.Where can we have a\nlittle private talk?\"said Croyden, stepping quickly around the horse and\ncontinuing on his way--Macloud and Axtell following.\"If you'd rather have it before your friends, I'm perfectly ready to\naccommodate you,\" said the fellow.\"I thought, however, you'd rather\nkeep the little secret.Well, we'll be waiting for you at the tents,\nall right, my friend!\"\"Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows right now--and easy, too,\"\nsaid Croyden.\"When we get to the tents, I'll take them into one--and\ngive them a chance to talk.When you and Axtell have the revolvers,\nwith one for me, you can join us.They are armed, of course, but only\nwith small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop on them before\nthey can draw.Come, at any time--I'll let down the tent flaps on the\nplea of secrecy (since they've suggested it), so you can approach with\nimpunity.\"\"This is where _we_ get killed, Axtell!\"\"I would that I\nwere in my happy home, or any old place but here.But I've enlisted for\nthe war, so here goes!If you think it will do any good to pray, we can\njust as well wait until you've put up a few.I'm not much in that line,\nmyself.\"\"But there seem to be no rules to the game\nwe're playing, so I wanted to give you the opportunity.\"As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed the reins to Bald-head\nand got out.\"Leave it to me, I'll get them together,\" Croyden answered.... \"You\nwish to see me, privately?\"\"I wish to see you--it's up to you whether to make it private or not.\"said Croyden, leading the way toward the tent, which was\npitched a trifle to one side.... \"Now, sir, what is it?\"as the flaps\ndropped behind them.\"You've a business way about you, which I like----\" began Hook-nose.\"Come to the point--what do\nyou want?\"\"There's no false starts with you, my friend, are there!\"You lost a letter recently----\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Croyden cut in.\"I had a letter _stolen_--you, I suppose,\nare the thief.\"\"I, or my pal--it matters not which,\" the fellow replied easily.\"Now,\nwhat we want, is to make some arrangement as to the division of the\ntreasure, when you've found it.\"\"Well, let me tell you there won't\nbe any arrangement made with you, alone.You must get your pal here--I\ndon't agree with one.\"Oh, very well, I'll have him in, if you wish.\"Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and raised the flap.he called, \"hitch the horse and come in.\"And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.While Hook-nose was summoning his partner, Croyden very naturally\nretired to the rear of the tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their\nbacks to the entrance.\"I'm glad to make your acquaint----\" began Smith.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.\"There is no need for an introduction,\" Croyden interrupted curtly.\"You're thieves, by profession, and blackmailers, in addition.Get down\nto business, if you please!\"\"You're not overly polite, my friend--but we'll pass that by.You're\nhell for business, and that's our style.You understand, I see, that\nthis treasure hunt has got to be kept quiet.If anyone peaches, the\nGovernment's wise and Parmenter's chest is dumped into its strong\nbox--that is, as much as is left after the officials get their own\nflippers out.Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching, and,\nwhen the jewels is found, me and Bill will take half and youn's half.Then we all can knock off work, and live respectable.\"\"Rather a good bargain for you,\" said Croyden.\"We supply the\ninformation, do all the work and give up half the spoils--for what,\npray?\"\"For our silence, and an equal share in the information.You have\ndoubtless forgot that we have the letter now.\"\"Better\nhalf a big loaf than no loaf at all.\"\"I see what's in your mind, all right.But it won't work, and you know\nit.You can have us arrested, yes--and lose your plunder.Parmenter's\nmoney belongs to the United States because it's buried in United States\nland.A word to the Treasury Department, with the old pirate's letter,\nand the jig is up.We'll risk your giving us to the police, my friend!\"\"If you're one to throw away good money, I miss\nmy guess.\"\"I forgot to say, that as you're fixed so comfortable here, me and Bill\nmight as well stay with you--it will be more convenient, when you\nuncover the chest, you know; in the excitement, you're liable to forget\nthat we come in for a share.\"His ears were\nprimed, and they told him that Macloud and Axtell were coming--\"Let us\nhave them all, so I can decide--I want no afterthoughts.\"\"You've got them all--and very reasonable they are!\"Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly into the tent.Something in Croyden's face caused Hook-nose's laugh to end abruptly.He swung sharply around--and faced Macloud's leveled revolver--Axtell's\ncovered his pal.--Croyden cried--\"None of that,\nHook-nose!--make another motion to draw a gun, and we'll scatter your\nbrains like chickenfeed.\"His own big revolver was sticking out of\nMacloud's pocket.\"Now, I'll look after you, while my\nfriends tie up your pal, and the first one to open his head gets a\nbullet down his throat.\"\"Hands behind your back, Bald-head,\" commanded Axtell, briskly.He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them on.\"Now, lie down and put your feet together--closer!\"Now, I'll do for you,\" Axtell remarked, turning toward Hook-nose.With Croyden's and Macloud's guns both covering him, the fellow was\nquickly secured.\"With your permission, we will search you,\" said Croyden.\"Macloud, if\nyou will look to Mr.Smith, I'll attend to Hook-nose.We'll give them a\ntaste of their own medicine.\"\"I don't care to shoot a prisoner, but I'll do\nit without hesitation.It's going to be either perfect quiet or\npermanent sleep--and you may do the choosing.\"He slowly went through Hook-nose's clothes--finding a small pistol,\nseveral well-filled wallets, and, in his inside waistcoat pocket, the\nParmenter letter.\"You stole one hundred and seventy-nine dollars from Mr.Macloud and\none hundred and eight from me,\" said Croyden.\"You may now have the\nprivilege of returning it, and the letter.If you make no more trouble,\nlie quiet and take your medicine, you'll receive no further harm.If\nyou're stubborn, we'll either kill you and dump your bodies in the Bay,\nor give you up to the police.The latter would be less trouble, for,\nwithout the letter, you can tell your story to the Department, or\nwhomever else you please--it's your word against ours--and you are\nthieves!\"\"How long are you going to hold us prisoners?\"asked Bald-head--\"till\nyou find the treasure?\"And luck is with you,\" Hook-nose sneered.\"At present, it _is_ with us--very much with us, my friend,\" said\nCroyden.\"You will excuse us, now, we have pressing business,\nelsewhere.\"When they were out of hearing, Macloud said:\n\n\"Doesn't our recovery of Parmenter's letter change things very\nmaterially?\"\"It seems to me it does,\" Croyden answered.\"Indeed, I think we need\nfear the rogues no longer--we can simply have them arrested for the\ntheft of our wallets, or even release them entirely.\"\"Arrest is preferable,\" said Macloud.\"It will obviate all danger of\nour being shot at long range, by the beggars.Let us put them where\nthey're safe, for the time.\"\"We can't\nsend for the police: if they find them here it would give color to\ntheir story of a treasure on Greenberry Point.\"\"Then Axtell and I will remain on guard, while you go to town and\narrange for their apprehension--say, just as they come off the Severn\nbridge.\"What if they don't cross the Severn--what if they scent our game, and\nkeep straight on to Baltimore?They can abandon their team, and catch a\nShort Line train at a way station.\"\"Then the Baltimore police can round them up.They've lost Parmenter's letter; haven't anything to substantiate their\nstory.Furthermore, we have a permit for the Chairman of the Naval\nAffairs Committee and friends to camp here.I think that, now, we can\nafford to ignore them--the recovery of the letter was exceedingly\nlucky.\"said Macloud--\"you're the one to be satisfied; it's a\nwhole heap easier than running a private prison ourselves.\"Croyden looked the other's horse over carefully, so he could describe\nit accurately, then they hitched up their own team and he drove off to\nAnnapolis.\"I told the Mayor we had passed two men on\nthe Severn bridge whom we identified as those who picked our pockets,\nWednesday evening, in Carvel Hall--and gave him the necessary\ndescriptions.He recognized the team as one of 'Cheney's Best,' and\nwill have the entire police force--which consists of four men--waiting\nat the bridge on the Annapolis side.\"\"They are\nthere, now, so we can turn the prisoners loose.\"Croyden and Macloud resumed their revolvers, and returned to the\ntent--to be greeted with a volley of profanity which, for fluency and\nvocabulary, was distinctly marvelous.Gradually, it died away--for want\nof breath and words.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.\"In the cuss line, you two are the real\nthing.Why didn't you open up sooner?--you shouldn't hide such\nproficiency from an admiring world.\"Whereat it flowed forth afresh from Hook-nose.Bald-head, however,\nremained quiet, and there was a faint twinkle in his eyes, as though he\ncaught the humor of the situation.They were severely cramped, and in\nconsiderable pain, but their condition was not likely to be benefited\nby swearing at their captors.said Croyden, as Hook-nose took a fresh start.Now, if you'll be quiet a moment, like\nyour pal, we will tell you something that possibly you'll not be averse\nto hear.... So, that's better.We're about to release you--let you go\nfree; it's too much bother to keep you prisoners.These little toy guns\nof yours, however, we shall throw into the Bay, in interest of the\npublic peace.Axtell, to remove the bonds?...Now, you may arise and shake yourselves--you'll, likely,\nfind the circulation a trifle restricted, for a few minutes.\"Hook-nose gave him a malevolent look, but made no reply, Bald-head\ngrinned broadly.\"Now, if you have sufficiently recovered, we will escort you to your\ncarriage!And with the two thieves in front, and the three revolvers bringing up\nthe rear, they proceeded to the buggy.XI\n\nELAINE CAVENDISH\n\n\n\"May we have seen the last of you!\"said Macloud, as the buggy\ndisappeared among the trees; \"and may the police provide for you in\nfuture.\"\"And while you're about it,\" said Croyden, \"you might pray that we find\nthe treasure--it would be quite as effective.\"Now, to resume where those rogues interrupted us.We had the jewels located, somewhere, within a radius of fifty feet.They must be, according to our theory, either on the bank or in the\nBay.We can't go at the water without a boat.Shall we tackle the land\nat once?or go to town and procure a boat, and be ready for either in\nthe morning.\"\"Don't let it go to waste, old man, let's have it!\"\"If you can give up hearing yourself talk, for a moment, I'll try!\"\"It is conceded, I believe, that digging on the Point\nby day may, probably will, provoke comment and possibly investigation\nas well.Then as soon as dusky\nNight has drawn her robes about her----\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\"ejaculated Croyden, with upraised hands.\"Then, as soon as dusky Night has drawn her robes about her,\" Macloud\nrepeated, imperturbably, \"we set to work, by the light of the silvery\nmoon.We arouse no comment--provoke no investigation.When morning\ndawns, the sands are undisturbed, and we are sleeping as peacefully as\nguinea pigs.\"\"And if there isn't a moon, we will set to work by the light of the\nsilvery lantern, I reckon!\"\"And, when we tackle the water, it will be in a silver boat and with\nsilver cuirasses and silver helmets, a la Lohengrin.\"\"And I suppose, our swan-song will be played on silver flutes!\"\"There won't be a swan-song--we're going to find Parmenter's treasure,\"\nsaid Macloud.Leaving Axtell in camp, they drove to town, stopping at the North end\nof the Severn bridge to hire a row-boat,--a number of which were drawn\nup on the bank--and to arrange for it to be sent around to the far end\nof the Point.At the hotel, they found a telephone call from the\nMayor's office awaiting them.The thieves had been duly captured, the Mayor said, and they had been\nsent to Baltimore.The Chief of Detectives happened to be in the\noffice, when they were brought in, and had instantly recognized them as\nwell-known criminals, wanted in Philadelphia for a particularly\natrocious hold-up.He had, thereupon, thought it best to let the Chief\ntake them back with him, thus saving the County the cost of a trial,\nand the penitentiary expense--as well as sparing Mr.Croyden and his\nfriend much trouble and inconvenience in attending court.He had had\nthem searched, but found nothing which could be identified.Croyden assured him it was more than satisfactory.That night, and every night for the\nnext three weeks, they kept at it.They dug up the entire zone\nof suspicion--it being loose sand and easy to handle.On the plea that\na valuable ruby ring had been lost overboard while fishing, they\ndragged and scraped the bottom of the Bay for a hundred yards around.Nothing smiled on them but the weather--it had\nremained uniformly good until the last two days before.Then there had\nset in, from the North-east, such a storm of rain as they had never\nseen.The very Bay seemed to be gathered up and dashed over the Point.They had sought refuge in the hotel, when the first chilly blasts of\nwind and water came up the Chesapeake.As it grew fiercer,--and a <DW64>\nsent out for information returned with the news that their tents had\nbeen blown away, and all trace of the camp had vanished--it was\ndecided that the quest should be abandoned.\"We knew from the first it\ncouldn't succeed.\"\"But we wanted to prove that it couldn't succeed,\" Macloud observed.\"If you hadn't searched, you always would have thought that, maybe, you\ncould have been successful.Now, you've had your try--and you've\nfailed.It will be easier to reconcile yourself to failure, than not to\nhave tried.\"\"In other words, it's better to have tried and lost, than never to have\ntried at all,\" Croyden answered.it's over and there's no profit\nin thinking more about it.We have had an enjoyable camp, and the camp\nis ended.I'll go home and try to forget Parmenter, and the jewel box\nhe buried down on Greenberry Point.\"\"I think I'll go with you,\" said Macloud.\"To Hampton--if you can put up with me a little longer.\"A knowing smile broke over Croyden's face.\"Maybe!--and maybe it is just you.At any rate, I'll come if I may.\"You know you're more than welcome, always!\"\"I'll go out to Northumberland to-night, arrange a few\nmatters which are overdue, and come down to Hampton as soon as I can\nget away.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next afternoon, as Macloud was entering the wide doorway of the\nTuscarora Trust Company, he met Elaine Cavendish coming out.There isn't a handy dinner man around, with you and Geoffrey\nboth away.Dine with us this evening, will you?--it will be strictly\n_en famille_, for I want to talk business.\"he thought, as, having accepted, he went on\nto the coupon department.\"It has to do with that beggar Croyden, I\nreckon.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd when, the dinner over, they were sitting before the open grate\nfire, in the big living room, she broached the subject without\ntimidity, or false pride.\"You are more familiar with Geoffrey Croyden's affairs than any one\nelse, Colin,\" she said, crossing her knees, in the reckless fashion\nwomen have now-a-days, and exposing a ravishing expanse of blue silk\nstockings, with an unconscious consciousness that was delightfully\nnaive.\"And I want to ask you something--or rather, several things.\"Macloud blew a whiff of cigarette smoke into the fire, and waited.\"I, naturally, don't ask you to violate any confidence,\" she went on,\n\"but I fancy you may tell me this: was the particular business in which\nGeoffrey was engaged, when I saw him in Annapolis, a success or a\nfailure?\"\"Did he tell you anything concerning\nit?\"\"Only that his return to Northumberland would depend very much on the\noutcome.\"\"Well, it wasn't a success; in fact, it was a complete failure.\"\"I do not mean, where is he this minute, but where\nis he in general--where would you address a wire, or a letter, and know\nthat it would be received?\"He threw his cigarette into the grate and lit another.\"I am not at liberty to tell,\" he said.\"Then, it is true--he is concealing himself.\"\"Not exactly--he is not proclaiming himself----\"\n\n\"Not proclaiming himself or his whereabouts to his Northumberland\nfriends, you mean?\"\"Are there such things as friends, when one\nhas been unfortunate?\"\"I can answer only for myself,\" she replied earnestly.\"I believe you, Elaine----\"\n\n\"Then tell me this--is he in this country or abroad?\"\"In this country,\" he said, after a pause.\"Is he in want,--I mean, in want for the things he has been used to?\"\"He is not in want, I can assure you!--and much that he was used to\nhaving, he has no use for, now.He was forced to give up the old life, so he chose\nwisely, I think--to go where his income was sufficient for his needs.\"She was silent for a while, staring into the blaze.He did not\ninterrupt--thinking it wise to let her own thoughts shape the way.she said suddenly, bending her blue\neyes hard upon his face.I ought not to have told you he was not abroad.\"\"This business which you and he were on, in Annapolis--it failed, you\nsay?\"\"And is there no chance that it may succeed, some time?\"\"But may not conditions change--something happen----\" she began.In this case, abandonment spells\nfinis.\"\"Did he know, when we were in Annapolis?\"\"On the contrary, he was very sanguine--it looked most promising\nthen.\"He blew ring after ring of smoke, and\nwaited, patiently.He was the friend, he saw, now.Croyden was the lucky fellow--and would not!Well, he had\nhis warning and it was in time.Since she was baring her soul to him,\nas friend to friend, it was his duty to help her to the utmost of his\npower.Suddenly, she uncrossed her knees and sat up.\"I have bought all the stock, and the remaining bonds of the Virginia\nDevelopment Company, from the bank that held them as collateral for\nRoyster & Axtell's loan,\" she said.I didn't\nappear in the matter--my broker bought them in _your_ name, and paid\nfor them in actual money.\"She arose, and bending swiftly over, kissed him on the cheek.\"I am, also, Geoffrey Croyden's friend, but\nthere are temptations which mortal man cannot resist.\"she smiled, leaning over the back of his chair, and\nputting her head perilously close to his--\"but I trust you--though I\nshan't kiss you again--at least, for the present.Now, you have been so\n_very_ good about the bonds, I want you to be good some more.He held his hands before him, to put them out of temptation.\"Ask me to crawl in the grate, and see how quickly I do it!\"\"It might prove my power, but I should lose my friend,\" she whispered.it's\nalready granted, that you should know, Elaine.\"\"You're a very sweet boy,\" she said, going back to her seat.But that you're a very sweet girl, needs no\nproof--unless----\" looking at her with a meaning smile.\"I should accept it as such,\" he averred--\"whenever you choose to\nconfer it.\"\"_Confer_ smacks of reward for service done,\" she said.\"Will it bide\ntill then?\"\"Wait--If you choose such pay, the----\"\n\n\"I choose no pay,\" he interrupted.\"Then, the reward will be in kind,\" she answered enigmatically.\"I want\nyou----\" She put one slender foot on the fender, and gazed at it,\nmeditatively, while the firelight stole covert glances at the silken\nankles thus exposed.\"I want you to purchase for me, from Geoffrey\nCroyden, at par, his Virginia Development Company bonds,\" she said.I will give you a check, now----\"\n\n\"Wait!\"he said; \"wait until he sells----\"\n\n\"You think he won't sell?\"\"I think he will have to be satisfied, first, as to the purchaser--in\nplain words, that it isn't either you or I. We can't give Geoffrey\nmoney!The bonds are practically worthless, as he knows only too\nwell.\"\"I had thought of that,\" she said, \"but, isn't it met by this very\nplan?Your broker purchases the bonds for your account, but he,\nnaturally, declines to reveal the identity of his customer.You can,\ntruthfully, tell Geoffrey that _you_ are not buying them--for you're\nnot.And _I_--if he will only give me the chance--will assure him that\nI am _not_ buying them from him--and you might confirm it, if he\nasked.\"It's juggling with the facts--though true on the face,\" said\nMacloud, \"but it's pretty thin ice we're skating on.\"He may take the two hundred\nthousand and ask no question.\"\"And you wouldn't think the same of him, if he did.\"\"So, we are back to the thin ice.I'll do what I can; but, you forgot,\nI am not at liberty to give his address to my brokers.I shall have to\ntake their written offer to buy, and forward it to him, which, in\nitself will oblige me, at the same time, to tell him that _I_ am not\nthe purchaser.\"\"I leave it entirely to you--manage it any way you see fit.All I ask,\nis that you get him to sell.It's horrible to think of Geoffrey being\nreduced to the bare necessities of life--for that's what it means, when\nhe goes 'where his income is sufficient for his needs.'\"\"It's unfortunate, certainly: it would be vastly worse for a woman--to\ngo from luxury to frugality, from everything to relatively nothing is\npositively pathetic.However, Croyden is not suffering--he has an\nattractive house filled with old things, good victuals, a more than\ncompetent cook, and plenty of society.He has cut out all the\nnon-essentials, and does the essentials economically.\"\"You speak of your own knowledge,\nnot from his inferences?\"he laughed; \"but quite the equal of our own\ndifferentiated.If Croyden were a marrying man--with sufficient income\nfor two--I should give him about six months, at the outside.\"\"And how much would you give one with sufficient for two--_yourself_,\nfor instance?\"\"Just long enough to choose the girl--and convince her of the propriety\nof the choice.\"\"And do you expect to join Geoffrey, soon?\"\"As soon as I can get through here,--probably in a day or two.\"\"Then, we may look for the new Mrs.Macloud in time for the holidays, I\npresume.--Sort of a Christmas gift?\"\"About then--if I can pick among so many, and she ratifies the pick.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.\"No!--there are so many I didn't have time to more than look them over.When I go back, I'll round them up, cut out the most likely, and try to\ntie and brand her.\"\"One would think, from your talk, that\nGeoffrey was in a cowboy camp, with waitresses for society.\"He grinned, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\"And nothing can induce you to tell me the location of the camp?\"\"Let us try the bond matter, first.If\nhe sells, I think he will return; if not, I'll then consider telling.\"\"You're a good fellow, Colin, dear!\"she whispered, leaning over and\ngiving his hand an affectionate little pat.\"You're so nice and\ncomfortable to have around--you never misunderstand, nor draw\ninferences that you shouldn't.\"\"Which means, I'm not to draw inferences now?\"\"Nor at any other time,\" she remarked.\"Will be forthcoming,\" with an alluring smile.\"I've a mind to take part payment now,\" said he, intercepting the hand\nbefore she could withdraw it.whisking it loose, and darting around a table.With a swift movement, she swept up her skirts and fled--around chairs,\nand tables, across rugs, over sofas and couches--always manoeuvring to\ngain the doorway, yet always finding him barring the way;--until, at\nlast, she was forced to refuge behind a huge davenport, standing with\none end against the wall.he demanded, coming slowly toward her in the\ncul de sac.\"It is five steps, until I reach\nyou--One!--Will you yield?\"\"Four----\"\n\nQuick as thought, she dropped one hand on the back of the davenport;\nthere was a flash of slippers, lingerie and silk, and she was across\nand racing for the door, now fair before her, leaving him only the echo\nof a mocking laugh.she counted, tauntingly, from the hall.\"I'll be good for to-night, Elaine--you\nneed have no further fear.\"She tossed her head ever so slightly, while a bantering look came into\nher eyes.\"I'm not much afraid of you, now--nor any time,\" she answered.\"But you\nhave more courage than I would have thought, Colin--decidedly more!\"XII\n\nONE LEARNED IN THE LAW\n\n\nIt was evening, when Croyden returned to Hampton--an evening which\ncontained no suggestion of the Autumn he had left behind him on the\nEastern Shore.It was raw, and damp, and chill, with the presage of\nwinter in its cold; the leaves were almost gone from the trees, the\nblackening hand of frost was on flower and shrubbery.As he passed up\nthe dreary, deserted street, the wind was whistling through the\nbranches over head, and moaning around the houses like spirits of the\ndamned.He turned in at Clarendon--shivering a little at the prospect.He was\nbeginning to appreciate what a winter spent under such conditions\nmeant, where one's enjoyments and recreations are circumscribed by the\nbounds of comparatively few houses and few people--people, he\nsuspected, who could not understand what he missed, of the hurly-burly\nof life and amusement, even if they tried.Their ways were sufficient\nfor them; they were eminently satisfied with what they had; they could\nnot comprehend dissatisfaction in another, and would have no patience\nwith it.He could imagine the dismalness of Hampton, when contrasted with the\nbrightness of Northumberland.The theatres, the clubs, the constant\ndinners, the evening affairs, the social whirl with all that it\ncomprehended, compared with an occasional dinner, a rare party,\ninterminable evenings spent, by his own fireside, alone!To be sure, Miss Carrington, and Miss Borden, and Miss Lashiel, and\nMiss Tilghman, would be available, when they were home.But the winter\nwas when they went visiting, he remembered, from late November until\nearly April, and, at that period, the town saw them but little.There\nwas the Hampton Club, of course, but it was worse than nothing--an\nopportunity to get mellow and to gamble, innocent enough to those who\nwere habituated to it, but dangerous to one who had fallen, by\nadversity, from better things....\n\nHowever, Macloud would be there, shortly, thank God!And the dear girls\nwere not going for a week or so, he hoped.And, when the worst came, he\ncould retire to the peacefulness of his library and try to eke out a\nfour months' existence, with the books, and magazines and papers.Moses held open the door, with a bow and a flourish, and the lights\nleaped out to meet him.It was some cheer, at least, to come home to a\nbright house, a full larder, faithful servants--and supper ready on the\ntable, and tuned to even a Clubman's taste.\"Moses, do you know if Miss Carrington's at home?\"he asked, the coffee\non and his cigar lit.her am home, seh, I seed she herse'f dis mornin' cum down\nde parf from de front poach wid de dawg, seh.\"Croyden nodded and went across the hall to the telephone.Miss Carrington, herself, answered his call.--Yes, she intended to be\nhome all evening.She would be delighted to see him and to hear a full\naccount of himself.He was rather surprised at his own alacrity, in finishing his cigar and\nchanging his clothes--and he wondered whether it was the girl, or the\ncompanionship, or the opportunity to be free of himself?A little of\nall three, he concluded.... But, especially, the _girl_, as she came\nfrom the drawing-room to meet him.\"So you have really returned,\" she said, as he bowed over her slender\nfingers.\"We were beginning to fear you had deserted us.\"\"You don't appreciate your own\nattractions.\"The \"you\" was plainly singular, but she refused to see it.\"Our own attractions require us to be modest,\" she returned; \"with\na--man of the world.\"\"Whatever I may have been, I am, now, a man of\nHampton.\"\"If you live here--take on our ways, our beliefs, our mode of thinking,\nyou may, in a score of years, grow like us, outwardly; but, inwardly,\nwhere the true like must start, _never_!\"You've been bred differently, used to\ndifferent things, to doing them in a different way.We do things\nslowly, leisurely, with a fine disregard of time, you, with the modern\nrush, and bustle, and hurry.You are a man of the world--I repeat\nit--up to the minute in everything--never lagging behind, unless you\nwish.You never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.We never\ndo anything to-day that can be put off till to-morrow.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.\"And which do you prefer, the to-day or the to-morrow?\"\"It depends on my humor, and my location, at the time--though, I must\nadmit, the to-day makes for thrift, and business, and success in\nacquiring wealth.\"It is a return toward the\nprimitive condition--the survival of the fittest.There must be losers\nas well as acquirers.\"she exclaimed, \"that one must lose in order\nthat another may gain.\"\"But as we are not in Utopia or Altruria,\" he smiled, \"it will continue\nso to be.Why, even in Baltimore, they----\"\n\n\"Oh, Baltimore is only an overgrown country town!\"\"With half a million population, it is as\nprovincial as Hampton, and thanks God for it--the most smug,\nself-satisfied, self-sufficient municipality in the land, with its\ncobblestones, its drains-in-the-gutters, its how much-holier-than-thou\nair about everything.\"\"Because it happens to be on the main line between Washington and the\nNorth.\"\"At least, the people are nice, barring a few mushrooms who are making\na great to-do.\"\"Yes, the people _are_ delightful!--And, when it comes to mushrooms,\nNorthumberland has Baltimore beaten to a frazzle.\"It is--but it's not overcrowded.About as many die every day, as are\nborn every night; and, at any rate, they don't interfere with those who\nreally belong--except to increase prices, and the cost of living, and\nclog the avenue with automobiles.\"but whither it leads no one knows--to the devil,\nlikely--or a lemon garden.\"\"'Blessed are the lemons on earth, for they shall be peaches in\nHeaven!'\"\"What a glorious peach your Miss Erskine will be,\" he replied.\"I'm afraid you don't appreciate the great honor the lady did you, in\ncondescending to view the _treasures_ of Clarendon, and to talk about\nthem afterward.To hear her, she is the most intimate friend you have\nin Hampton.\"he said, \"I'm glad you told me.Somehow, I'm always drawing\nlemons.\"\"Quite immaterial to the question, which is: A lemon or not a lemon", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "\"If you could but see yourself at this moment, you would not ask,\" he\nsaid, looking at her with amused scrutiny.The lovely face, the blue black hair, the fine figure in the simple\npink organdie, the slender ankles, the well-shod feet--a lemon!\"But as I can't see myself, and have no mirror handy, your testimony is\ndesired,\" she insisted.\"Then you can't have any objection----\"\n\n\"If you bring Miss Erskine in?\"\"----if I take you there for a game of Bridge--shall we go this very\nevening?\"\"I don't wish--and we are growing very silly.Come, tell\nabout your Annapolis trip.\"It's a queer old town, Annapolis--they call it the 'Finished City!'It's got plenty of landmarks, and relics, but nothing more.If it were\nnot for the State Capitol and Naval Academy, it would be only a lot of\nruins, lost in the sand.No one on\nthe streets, no one in the shops, no one any place.--Deserted--until\nthere's a fire.\"But, with the\nautumn and the Academy in session, the town seemed very much alive.We\nsampled 'Cheney's Best,' Wegard's Cakes, and saw the Custard-and-Cream\nChapel.\"\"You've been to Annapolis, sure!\"\"There's only one thing\nmore--did you see Paul Jones?\"You can't find him without the aid of a\ndetective or a guide.\"We accepted the vast labors and the\nmoney of our Ambassador to France in locating the remains of America's\nfirst Naval Hero; we sent an Embassy and a warship to bring them back;\nwe received them with honor, orated over them, fired guns over them.And then, when the spectators had departed--assuming they were to be\ndeposited in the crypt of the Chapel--we calmly chucked them away on a\ncouple of trestles, under a stairway in Bancroft Hall, as we would an\nold broom or a tin can.That's _our_ way of honoring the only Naval\nCommander we had in the Revolution.It would have been better, much\nbetter, had we left him to rest in the quiet seclusion of his grave in\nFrance--lost, save in memory, with the halo of the past and privacy of\ndeath around him.\"\"Why bring him here,\nwith the attendant expense, and then stop, just short of completion?Why didn't we inter him in the Chapel (though, God save me from burial\nthere), or any place, rather than on trestles under a stairway in a\nmidshipmen's dormitory?\"\"Because the appropriation was exhausted, or because the Act wasn't\nworded to include burial, or because the Superintendent didn't want the\nbother, or because it was a nuisance to have the remains around--or\nsome other absurd reason.At all events, he is there in the cellar, and\nhe is likely to stay there, till Bancroft Hall is swallowed up by the\nBay.The junket to France, the parade, the speeches, the spectacular\npart are over, so, who cares for the entombment, and the respect due\nthe distinguished dead?\"\"I don't mean to be disrespectful,\" he observed, \"but it's hard luck to\nhave one's bones disturbed, after more than a hundred years of\ntranquillity, to be conveyed clear across the Atlantic, to be orated\nover, and sermonized over, and, then, to be flung aside like old junk\nand forgot.However, we have troubles of our own--I know I have--more\nreal than Paul Jones!He may be glad he's dead, so he won't have any to\nworry over.In fact, it's a good thing to be dead--one is saved from a\nheap of worry.\"\"A daily struggle to procure fuel sufficient\nto keep up the fire.\"Why not make an end of life, at once?\"\"Sometimes, I'm tempted,\" he admitted.\"It's the leap in the dark, and\nno returning, that restrains, I reckon--and the fact that we must face\nit alone.You have\nbegged the question, or what amounts to it.But, to return to\nAnnapolis; what else did you see?\"\"Then you know what I saw,\" he replied.This isn't the day of the rapier and the mask.\"She half closed her eyes and looked at him through the long lashes.\"What were you doing down on Greenberry Point?\"I was in Annapolis--I saw your name on the\nregister--I inquired--and I had the tale of the camp.No one, however,\nseemed to think it queer!\"Camping out is entirely natural,\" Croyden answered.\"With the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs?\"\"A party which until five days ago he had not joined--at least, so the\nSuperintendent told me, when I dined at his house.He happened to\nmention your name, found I knew you--and we gossiped.Perhaps we\nshouldn't, but we did.\"he didn't seem even to wonder at your being there----\"\n\n\"But _you_ did?\"\"It's the small town in me, I suppose--to be curious about other people\nand their business; and it was most suspicious.\"First, you hire a boat and cross the Bay direct from\nHampton to Annapolis.Second, you procure, through Senator Rickrose, a\npermit from the Secretary of the Navy to camp on Greenberry Point.Third, you actually do camp, there, for nearly, or quite three weeks.Why go clear to the Western Shore, and choose a\ncomparatively inaccessible and exposed location on United States\nproperty, if the idea were only a camp?Why not camp over on Kent\nIsland, or on this coast?Anywhere, within a few miles of Hampton,\nthere are scores of places better adapted than Greenberry Point.\"With a series of premises, you can reach whatever conclusion\nyou wish--you're not bound by the probabilities.\"\"You're simply obscuring the point,\" she insisted.\"In this instance,\nmy premises are facts which are not controverted.Why?----\" She held up her hand.I'm simply\n'chaffing of you,' don't you know!\"\"With just a lingering curiosity, however,\" he added.\"Which, some time, I shall gratify.You've trailed me down--we _were_\non Greenberry Point for a purpose, but nothing has come of it, yet--and\nit's likely a failure.\"Croyden, I don't wish to know.It was a mistake to refer\nto it.I should simply have forgot what I heard in Annapolis--I'll\nforget now, if you will permit.\"You can't forget, if you would--and I\nwould not have you, if you could.Moreover, I inherited it along with\nClarendon, and, as you were my guide to the place, it's no more than\nright that you should know.I think I shall confide in you--no use to\nprotest, it's got to come!\"\"You are determined?--Very well, then, come over to the couch in the\ncorner, where we can sit close and you can whisper.\"She put out her hand and led him--and he\nsuffered himself to be led.when they were seated, \"you may begin.Once upon a time----\" and\nlaughed, softly.\"I'll take this, if you've no immediate use for it,\"\nshe said, and released her hand from his.\"I shall want it back, presently, however.\"\"Do you, by any chance, get all you want?\"Else I would have kept what I already had.\"She put her hands behind her, and faced around.\"Well,--once upon a time----\" Then he stopped.\"I'll go over to the\nhouse and get the letter--it will tell you much better than I can.You\nwill wait here, _right here_, until I return?\"She looked at him, with a tantalizing smile.\"Won't it be enough, if I am here _when_ you return?\"When he came out on the piazza the rain had ceased, the clouds were\ngone, the temperature had fallen, and the stars were shining brightly\nin a winter sky.He strode quickly down the walk to the street and crossed it diagonally\nto his own gates.As he passed under the light, which hung near the\nentrance, a man walked from the shadow of the Clarendon grounds and\naccosted him.Croyden halted, abruptly, just out of distance.\"With your permission, I will accompany you to your house--to which I\nassume you are bound--for a few moments' private conversation.\"He was about thirty years of age, tall\nand slender, was well dressed, in dark clothes, a light weight\ntop-coat, and a derby hat.His face was ordinary, however, and Croyden\nhad no recollection of ever having seen it--certainly not in Hampton.\"I'm not in the habit of discussing business with strangers, at night,\nnor of taking them to my house,\" he answered, brusquely.\"If you have\nanything to say to me, say it now, and be brief.\"Some one may hear us,\" the man objected.\"Pardon me, but I think, in this matter, you would have objection.\"\"You'll say it quickly, and here, or not at all,\" snapped Croyden.\"It's scarcely a subject to be discussed on the street,\" he observed,\n\"but, if I must, I must.Did you ever hear of Robert Parmenter?Well, the business concerns a certain letter--need I\nbe more explicit?\"\"If you wish to make your business intelligible.\"\"As you wish,\" he said, \"though it only consumes time, and I was under\nthe impression that you were in a hurry.However: To repeat--the\nbusiness concerns a letter, which has to do with a certain treasure\nburied long ago, on Greenberry Point, by the said Robert Parmenter.Do\nI make myself plain, now, sir?\"\"Your language is entirely intelligible--though I cannot answer for the\nfacts recited.\"The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:\n\n\"The letter in question having come into your possession recently, you,\nwith two companions, spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,\nostensibly for your health, or the night air, or anything else that\nwould deceive the Naval authorities.During which time, you dug up the\nentire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining--and then\ndeparted, very strangely choosing for it a time of storm and change of\nweather.Evidently, the thieves had managed to\ncommunicate with a confederate, and this was a hold-up.\"Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that your search was\nnot ineffectual.In plain words, you have recovered the treasure.\"Croyden only smiled, and waited, too.\"Very good!--we will proceed,\" said the stranger.It makes no difference whether recovered on\nthe Point or on the Bay--the law covering treasure trove, I am\ninformed, doesn't apply.The Government is entitled to the entire find,\nit being the owner in fee of the land.\"\"I have devoted my spare moments to the study of\nthe law----\"\n\n\"And how to avoid it,\" Croyden interjected.\"And also how to prevent _others_ from avoiding it,\" he replied,\nsuggestively.\"Let us take up that phase, if it please you.\"asked Croyden, suppressing an inclination\nto laugh.\"Then let us take it up, any way--unless you wish to forfeit your find\nto the Government.\"\"We are arriving, now, at the pith of the\nmatter.We will take Parmenter's estimate and\nmultiply it by two, though jewels have appreciated more than that in\nvaluation.Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars, which will total, according to the calculation, half a million\ndollars,--one half of which amount you pay us as our share.\"Why don't you call it properly--blackmail?\"\"If you prefer blackmail to\nshare, it will not hinder the contract--seeing that it is quite as\nillegal on your part as on ours.Share merely sounds a little better\nbut either obtains the same end.Call it what you\nwill--but _pay_.\"\"If you are not familiar\nwith the law covering the subject under discussion, let me enlighten\nyou.\"\"I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly,\" the stranger\nreplied, refusing to be hurried or flustered.\"The Common Law and the\npractice of the Treasury Department provide, that all treasure found on\nGovernment land or within navigable waters, is Government property.If\ndeclared by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid such reward as\nthe Secretary may determine.If he does not declare, and is informed\non, the informer gets the reward.You will observe that, under the law,\nyou have forfeited the jewels--I fancy I do not need to draw further\ndeductions.\"\"No!--it's quite unnecessary,\" Croyden remarked.\"Your fellow thieves\nwent into that phase (good word, I like it!)rather fully, down on\nGreenberry Point.Unluckily, they fell into the hands of the police,\nalmost immediately, and we have not been able to continue the\nconversation.\"\"I have the honor to continue the conversation--and, in the interim,\nyou have found the treasure.So, Parmenter's letter won't be\nessential--the facts, circumstances, your own and Mr.Macloud's\ntestimony, will be sufficient to prove the Government's case.Then, as\nyou are aware, it's pay or go to prison for larceny.\"\"There is one very material hypothesis, which you assume as a fact, but\nwhich is, unfortunately, not a fact,\" said Croyden.The man laughed, good-humoredly.\"We don't ask you to acknowledge the\nfinding--just pay over the quarter of a million and we will forget\neverything.\"\"My good man, I'm speaking the truth!\"\"Maybe it's\ndifficult for you to recognize, but it's the truth, none the less.I\nonly wish I _had_ the treasure--I think I'd be quite willing to share\nit, even with a blackmailer!\"\"I trust it will give no offence if I say I don't believe you.\"And, without more ado, he turned his back and went up the path to\nClarendon.XII\n\nI COULD TELL SOME THINGS\n\n\nWhen Croyden had got Parmenter's letter from the secret drawer in the\nescritoire, he rang the old-fashioned pull-bell for Moses.It was only\na little after nine, and, though he did not require the <DW64> to remain\nin attendance until he retired, he fancied the kitchen fire still held\nhim.In a moment Moses appeared--his eyes heavy\nwith the sleep from which he had been aroused.\"Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?\"Hit's bin so long sence I dun hit, I t'ink I'se\ngun-shy, seh.\"\"Yass, seh, I has don hit.\"\"And you could do it again, if necessary?\"\"I speck so, seh--leas'wise, I kin try--dough I'se mons'us unsuttin,\nseh, mons'us unsuttin!\"\"Uncertain of what--your shooting or your hitting?\"\"Well, we're all of us somewhat uncertain in that line.At least you\nknow enough not to point the revolver toward yourself.\"said the <DW64>, with a\nbroad grin.\"There is a revolver, yonder, on the table,\" said Croyden, indicating\none of those they used on Greenberry Point.\"It's a self-cocker--you\nsimply pull the trigger and the action does the rest.\"Yass, seh, I onderstands,\" said Moses.\"Bring it here,\" Croyden ordered.Moses' fingers closed around the butt, a bit timorously, and he carried\nit to his master.\"I'll show you the action,\" said Croyden.\"Here, is the ejector,\"\nthrowing the chamber out, \"it holds six shots, you see: but you never\nput a cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything strikes the\ntrigger, it's likely to be discharged.\"Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and passed it over to Moses,\nwho took it with a little more assurance.He was harkening back thirty\nyears, and more.\"What do yo warn me to do, seh?\"\"I want you to sit down, here, while I'm away, and if any one tries to\nget in this house, to-night, you're to shoot him.I'm going over to\nCaptain Carrington's--I'll be back by eleven o'clock.It isn't likely\nyou will be disturbed; if you are, one shot will frighten him off, even\nif you don't hit him, and I'll hear the shot, and come back at once.\"Yass, seh!--I'm to shoot anyone what tries to get in.\"\"You're to shoot anyone who tries to\n_break_ in.don't shoot me, when I return, or any\none else who comes legitimately.Be sure he is an intruder, then bang\naway.\"I'se dub'us bout hittin', but I kin bang\naway right nuf.Does yo' spose any one will try to git in, seh?\"Croyden smiled--\"but you be ready for them, Moses, be\nready for them.It's just as well to provide against contingencies.\"as Croyden went out and the front door closed behind him,\n\"but dem 'tingencies is monty dang'ous t'ings to fools wid.I don'\nlikes hit, dat's whar I don'.\"Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he had left her--a quick\nreturn to the sofa having been synchronous with his appearance in the\nhall.\"I had a mind not to wait here,\" she said; \"you were an inordinately\nlong time, Mr.\"I was, and I admit\nit--but it can be explained.\"\"Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter, deceased!\"said\nhe, and gave her the letter.\"Oh, this is the letter--do you mean that I am to read it?\"She read it through without a single word of comment--an amazing thing\nin a woman, who, when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions\nto the minute than can be answered in a month.When she had finished,\nshe turned back and read portions of it again, especially the direction\nas to finding the treasure, and the postscript bequests by the Duvals.At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and looked up at Croyden.\"Most extraordinary in its\nordinariness, and most ordinary in its extraordinariness.And you\nsearched, carefully, for three weeks and found--nothing?\"\"First, tell me where you obtained this letter?\"\"I found it by accident--in a secret compartment of an escritoire at\nClarendon,\" he answered.\"This is the tale of Parmenter's treasure--and how we did _not_ find\nit!\"Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details--from the finding of\nthe letter to the present moment, dwelling particularly on the episode\nof the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming of the\nthieves to the Point, their capture and subsequent release, together\nwith the occurrence of this evening, when he was approached, by the\nwell-dressed stranger, at Clarendon's gates.And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington did not\ninterrupt, through the entire course of the narrative.Nor did she\nbreak the silence for a time after he had concluded, staring\nthoughtfully, the while, down into the grate, where a smouldering back\nlog glowed fitfully.\"What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?\"In the\nwords of the game, popular hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!\"\"But he doesn't know it's a bobtail.He is convinced you found the\ntreasure,\" she objected.\"Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won't bother me, in the\nleast.\"\"He has confederates--they may\nattack Clarendon, in an effort to capture the treasure.\"this is the twentieth century, not the seventeenth!\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.\"We don't'stand-by to repel boarders,' these days.\"\"Rather queer!--I've heard those same words before, in this\nconnection.\"\"Possibly--though I don't recall it.Suppose you are attacked and\ntortured till you reveal where you've hidden the jewels?\"\"However, I\nput Moses on guard--with a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone\nmolesting the house.If we hear a fusillade we'll know it's he shooting\nup the neighborhood.\"\"Then the same idea _did_ suggest itself to you!\"\"Only to the extent of searching for the jewels--I regarded that as\nvaguely possible, but there isn't the slightest danger of any one being\ntortured.\"\"You know best, I suppose,\" she said--\"but you've had your warning--and\npirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.You've given up all hope of finding\nthe treasure--abandoned jewels worth--how many dollars?\"\"Possibly half a million,\" he filled in.\"If you can suggest what to do--anything which hasn't been done, I\nshall be only too glad to consider it.\"\"You say you dug up the entire Point for a hundred yards inland?\"\"And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?\"He regarded her with an amused\nsmile.\"I don't see what you're to do, except to do it all over again,\" she\nannounced--\"Now, don't laugh!It may sound foolish, but many a thing\nhas been found on a second seeking--and this, surely, is worth a\nsecond, or a third, or even many seekings.\"\"If there were any assurance of ultimate success, it would pay to spend\na lifetime hunting.The two essentials, however, are wanting: the\nextreme tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the beech-trees.We made\nthe best guess at their location.More than that, the zone of\nexploration embraced every possible extreme of territory--yet, we\nfailed.It will make nothing for success to try again.\"\"Somewhere, in the Bay!--It's shoal water, for three or four hundred\nfeet around the Point, with a rock bottom.The Point itself has been\neaten into by the Bay, down to this rock.Parmenter's chest disappeared\nwith the land in which it was buried, and no man will find it now,\nexcept by accident.\"\"Without anyone having the fun of wasting it!\"She took up Parmenter's letter again, and glanced over it.Then she\nhanded it back, and shook her head.\"It's too much for my poor brain,\" she said.We gave it rather more than a fair trial,\nand, then, we gave it up.When I go home, to-night, I shall\nreturn the letter to the escritoire where I found it, and forget it.\"You can return it to its hiding place,\" she reflected, \"but you can't\ncease wondering.Why didn't Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while the\nlandmarks were there?\"Probably on account of old Parmenter's restriction that it be left\nuntil the 'extremity of need.'\"\"Probably,\" she said, \"the Duvals would regard it as a matter of honor\nto observe the exact terms of the bequest.\"It's only because they did so, that I got a chance to search!\"\"You mean that, otherwise, there would be no buried treasure!\"And with all that money, the Duvals\nmight have gone away from Hampton--might have experienced other\nconditions.Colonel Duval might never have met your father--you might\nhave never come to Clarendon.--My goodness!\"In the realm of pure conjecture,\" he answered.\"It is idle to theorize\non the might-have-beens, or what might-have-happened if the\nwhat-did-happen hadn't happened.Dismiss it, at least, for this\nevening.You asked what I was doing for three weeks at Annapolis, and I\nhave consumed a great while in answering--let us talk of something\nelse.What have you been doing in those three weeks?\"A little Bridge, a few riding parties, some sails on the Bay,\nwith an occasional homily by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered,\nand I couldn't get away.Then is when I learned what a deep impression\nyou had made!\"\"We both were learning, it seems,\" he replied.\"You made an impression, also--of course, that's to be expected, but\nthis impression is much more than the ordinary kind!\"_\"Merci, Monsieur_,\" she scoffed.\"No, it isn't _merci_, it's a fact.And he is a mighty good fellow on\nwhom to make an impression.\"\"For he's coming back----\"\n\n\"To Hampton?\"\"To be accurate, I expect him not later than the day-after-to-morrow.\"\"I shall believe you, when I see him!\"\"He is, I think, coming solely on your account.\"\"But you're not quite sure?--oh!\"Naturally, he hasn't confided in me.\"\"So you're confiding in me--how clever!\"\"I could tell some things----\"\n\n\"Which are fables.\"\"----but I won't--they might turn your head----\"\n\n\"Which way--to the right or left?\"\"----and make you too confident and too cruel.He saw you but\ntwice----\"\n\n\"Once!\"\"Once, on the street; again, when we called in the evening--but he gave\nyou a name, the instant he saw you----\"\n\n\"How kind of him!\"\"He called you: 'The Symphony in Blue.'\"\"Was that the first time you had noticed it?\"she said, \"I know you're intrepid--but you _won't_!\"\"Because, it would be false to your friend.\"Yes!--as between you two, you have renounced, in his favor.\"\"At least, I so view it,\" with a teasingly fascinating smile.\"Don't you think that you protest over-much?\"\"If we were two children, I'd say: 'You think you're smart, don't\nyou?'\"\"And I'd retort: 'You got left, didn't you?'\"\"Seriously, however--do you really expect Mr.\"I surely do--probably within two days; and I'm not chaffing when I say\nthat you're the inducement.So, be good to him--he's got more than\nenough for two, I can assure you.\"\"And what number am I--the twenty-first, or thereabout?\"\"What matters it, if you're _the_ one, at present?\"She raised her shoulders in the slightest shrug.\"I'd sooner be the present one than all the has-beens,\" he insisted.\"If it will advantage any----\"\n\n\"I

AND CONTEMPORARY MONUMENTS.Leaving these speculations to be developed more fully in the sequel, let\nus now turn to the pyramids\u2014the oldest, largest, and most mysterious of\nall the monuments of man\u2019s art now existing.All those in Egypt are\nsituated on the left bank of the Nile, just beyond the cultivated\nground, and on the edge of the desert, and all the principal examples\nwithin what may fairly be called the Necropolis of Memphis.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.Sixty or\nseventy of these have been discovered and explored, all which appear to\nbe royal sepulchres.This alone, if true would suffice to justify us in\nassigning a duration of 1000 years at least to the dynasties of the\npyramid builders, and this is about the date we acquire from other\nsources.The three great pyramids of Gizeh are the most remarkable and the best\nknown of all those of Egypt.Of these the first, erected by Cheops, or,\nas he is now more correctly named, Khufu, is the largest; but the next,\nby Chephren (Khafra), his successor, is scarcely inferior in dimensions;\nthe third, that of Mycerinus (Menkaura), is very much smaller, but\nexcelled the two others in this, that it had a coating of beautiful red\ngranite from Syene, while the other two were rev\u00eated only with the\nbeautiful limestone of the country.Part of this coating still remains\nnear the top of the second; and Colonel Vyse[29] was fortunate enough to\ndiscover some of the coping-stones of the Great Pyramid buried in the\nrubbish at its base.These are sufficient to indicate the nature and\nextent of the whole, and to show that it was commenced from the bottom\nand carried upwards; not at the top, as it has sometimes been\nthoughtlessly asserted.[30]\n\n[Illustration: No.Since Colonel Vyse\u2019s discovery, however, further casing-stones have been\nfound in situ by Mr.Flinders Petrie, whose measurements, taken in\n1880-82, and published in the following year,[31] are the most accurate\nyet made.The dimensions hitherto given have shown a difference of as\nmuch as eighteen inches in the length of the sides, which, if the\npyramid had been set out on a perfectly clear level ground, would have\ndetracted from the perfection which has been claimed for its setting\nout.This difference, however, it appears now, was due to the fact that\nthe various observers had measured from angle to angle of the corner\nsockets, and had \u201cassumed that the faces of the stones placed in them\nrose up vertically from the edge of the bottom until they reached the\npavement (whatever level that might be), from which the sloping face\nstarted upwards.\u201d This, however, was not the case; the sloping sides of\nthe Pyramid continued down to the rock surface, and the base was\neventually partially covered over by a level pavement or platform;[32]\nthe parts covered over varying in extent according to the depth they\nwere carried down.Petrie utilized the angle sockets for the purpose\nof obtaining the true diagonals of the casing, and having computed a\nsquare which passed through the points of casing found on each side, and\nhaving also its corners lying on the diagonals of the sockets, obtained\nthe dimensions of the original base of the Great Pyramid casing on the\nartificial platform or pavement, which was as follows:\u2014\n\n                                Sq.North side  9069\u00b74 or 755 9\u00b74\n                     East side   9067\u00b77 or 755 7\u00b77\n                     South side  9069\u00b75 or 755 8\u00b76\n                     West side   9068\u00b76 or 755 8\u00b78\n\nThe mean being 755 ft.8\u00b78 in., and the extreme difference being 1\u00b77 of\nan inch only.The actual height of the Great Pyramid from level of platform was 481\nft.4 in., and the angle of casing 51\u00b0 52\u02ba.In the Second Pyramid, the bottom corner of casing (which was in\ngranite) had a vertical base 10 or 12 in.high, against which the\npavement was laid; and the following were the dimensions obtained:\u2014\n\n                                Sq.North side  8471\u00b79 or 705 11\u00b79\n                     East side   8475\u00b72 or 706 3\u00b72\n                     South side  8476\u00b79 or 706 4\u00b79\n                     West side   8475\u00b75 or 706 3\u00b75\n\nThe mean being 706 ft.2\u00b79 in., and the extreme difference in the length\nof side 5 in.The height was 472 ft., and the angle of casing 53\u00b0 10\u02b9.The Third Pyramid was never quite finished, and there is some difficulty\nin determining the exact level of platform.The mean length of the sides\nwas calculated by Mr.1\u00b76 in., its height 215 ft., and\nthe angle of its casing 51\u00b0 10\u02b9.From this it will be seen that the area of the Great Pyramid (more than\n13 acres) is more than twice the extent of that of St.Peter\u2019s at Rome,\nor of any other building in the world.[33] Its height is equal to the\nhighest spire of any cathedral in Europe; for, though it has been\nattempted to", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Even the Third Pyramid covers more ground than\nany Gothic cathedral, and the mass of materials it contains far\nsurpasses that of any erection we possess in Europe.All the pyramids (with one exception) face exactly north, and have their\nentrance on that side\u2014a circumstance the more remarkable, as the later\nbuilders of Thebes appear to have had no notion of orientation, but to\nhave placed their buildings and tombs so as to avoid regularity, and\nfacing in every conceivable direction.Instead of the entrances to the\npyramids being level, they all <DW72> downwards\u2014generally at angles of\nabout 26\u00b0 to the horizon\u2014a circumstance which has led to an infinity of\nspeculation, as to whether they were not observatories, and meant for\nthe observation of the pole-star, &c.[34] All these theories, however,\nhave failed, for a variety of reasons it is needless now to discuss; but\namong others it may be mentioned that the angles are not the same in any\ntwo pyramids, though erected within a few years of one another, and in\nthe twenty which were measured by Colonel Vyse they vary from 22\u00b0 35\u02b9 to\n34\u00b0 5\u02b9.The angle of the inclination of the side of the pyramid to the\nhorizon is more constant, varying only from 51\u00b0 10\u02b9 to 52\u00b0 32\u02b9, and in\nthe Gizeh pyramid it would appear that the angle of the passage was\nintended to have been about one-half of this.Petrie gives a synopsis of the various theories connected with the\nGreat Pyramid, which applies not only to the outside form but to the\nseveral chambers and passages in the interior.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.\u201cThere are three great\nlines of theory,\u201d he says,[35] \u201cthroughout the Pyramid, each of which\nmust stand or fall as a whole, they are scarcely contradictory, and may\nalmost subsist together;\u201d these are (1) the Egyptian cubit (20\u00b762 in.)theory; (2) the \u03c0 proportion or radius and circumference theory; (3) the\ntheory of areas, squares of lengths and diagonals.Of the two first, and applying these only to the exterior by the cubit\ntheory, the outside form of pyramid is 280 cubits high and 440 cubits\nlength of side, or 7 in height to 11 of width.This is confirmed by the\n\u03c0 theory, where we get the very common proportion that the height is to\nthe circumference as the radius is to the circumference of a circle\ninscribed within its base; thus taking the mean height of 481 ft.4 in.,\nwe have 481\u00b733 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3\u00b71416 = 3024, whilst the side 755\u00b775 \u00d7 4 = 3023,\nso near a coincidence that it can hardly be accidental, and if it was\nintended, all the other external proportions follow as a matter of\ncourse.Even if this theory should not be accepted as the true one, it has at\nleast the merit of being nearer the truth than any other yet proposed.I\nconfess it appears to me so likely that I would hardly care to go\nfurther, especially as all the astronomical theories have signally\nfailed, and it seems as if it were only to some numerical fancy that we\nmust look for a solution of the puzzle.Be this as it may, the small residuum we get from all these pyramid\ndiscussions is, that they were built by the kings of the early dynasties\nof the old kingdom of Egypt as their tombs.The leading idea that\ngoverned their forms was that of durability\u2014a quasi-eternity of duration\nis what they aimed at.The entrances were meant to be concealed, and the\nangle of the passages was the limit of rest at which heavy bodies could\nbe moved while obtaining the necessary strength where they opened at the\noutside, and the necessary difficulty for protection inside, without\ntrenching on impossibility.By concealment of the entrance, the\ndifficulties of the passages, and the complicated but most ingenious\narrangement of portcullises, these ancient kings hoped to be allowed to\nrest in undisturbed security for at least 3000 years.Perhaps they were\nsuccessful, though their tombs have since been so shamefully profaned.To the principal dimensions of the Great Pyramid given above, it may be\nadded that the entrance is 55 ft.above the base, on the 19th\ncourse, which is deeper than the 11 to 14 courses above and below; at\npresent there remain 203 courses, to which must be added 12 to 14\nmissing.6 in., but they diminish\nin height\u2014generally speaking, but not uniformly\u2014towards the top.The\nsummit now consists of a platform 32 ft.square; so that about 27\nft.is wanting, the present actual height being 454 ft.It contains two\nchambers above-ground, and one cut in the rock at a considerable depth\nbelow the foundations.The passages and chambers are worthy of the mass; all are lined with\npolished granite; and the ingenuity and pains that have been taken to\nrender them solid and secure, and to prevent their being crushed by the\nsuperincumbent mass, raise our idea of Egyptian science higher than even\nthe bulk of the building itself could do.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.Section of King\u2019s Chamber and of Passage in\n  Great Pyramid.Towards the exterior, where the pressure is not great, the roof is flat,\nthough it is probable that even there the weight is throughout\ndischarged by 2 stones, sloping up at a certain angle to where they\nmeet, as at the entrance.Towards the centre of the pyramid, however,\nthe passage becomes 28 feet high, the 7 upper courses of stone\noverhanging one another as shown in the annexed section (fig.1), so as\nto reduce the bearing of the covering stone.Nowhere, however, is this\ningenuity more shown than in the royal chamber, which measures 17 ft.The walls are lined and the\nroof is formed of splendid slabs of Syenite, but above the roof 4\nsuccessive chambers, as shown in the annexed section (fig.2), have been\nformed, each divided from the other by slabs of granite, polished on\ntheir lower surfaces, but left rough on the upper, and above these a 5th\nchamber is formed of 2 sloping blocks to discharge the weight of the\nwhole.The first of these chambers has long been known; the upper four\nwere discovered and first entered by Colonel Vyse, and it was in one of\nthese that he discovered the name of the founder.This was not engraved\nas a record, but scribbled in red paint on the stones, apparently as a\nquarrymark, or as an address to the king, and accompanied by something\nlike directions for their position in the building.The interest that\nattaches to these inscriptions consists in the certainty of their being\ncontemporary records, in their proving that Khufu was the founder of the\nGreat Pyramid, and consequently fixing its relative date beyond all\npossibility of cavil.This is the only really virgin discovery in the\npyramids, as they have all been opened either in the time of the Greeks\nor Romans, or by the Mahometans, and an unrifled tomb of this age is\nstill a desideratum.Until such is hit upon we must remain in ignorance\nof the real mode of sepulture in those days, and of the purpose of many\nof the arrangements in these mysterious buildings.The portcullises which invariably close the entrances of the sepulchral\nchamber in the pyramids are among the most curious and ingenious of the\narrangements of these buildings.Generally they consist of great cubical\nmasses of granite, measuring 8 or 10 ft.each way, and consequently\nweighing 50 or 60 tons, and even more.These were fitted into chambers\nprepared during the construction of the building, but raised into the\nupper parts, and, being lowered after the body was deposited, closed the\nentrance so effectually that in some instances it has been found\nnecessary either to break them in pieces, or to cut a passage round\nthem, to gain admission to the chambers.They generally slide in grooves\nin the wall, to which they fit exactly, and altogether show a degree of\ningenuity and forethought very remarkable, considering the early age at\nwhich they were executed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.In the Second Pyramid one chamber has been discovered partly\nabove-ground, partly cut in the rock.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.In the Third the chambers are\nnumerous, all excavated in the rock; and from the tunnels that have been\ndriven by explorers through the superstructures of these two, it is very\ndoubtful whether anything is to be found above-ground.[36]\n\nAll the old pyramids do not follow the simple outline of those at Gizeh.That at Dahshur, for instance, rises to half the height, with a <DW72> of\n54\u00b0 to the horizon, but is finished at the angle of 45\u00b0, giving it a\nvery exceptional appearance.The pyramids of Sakkara and Medum are of\nthe class known as mastaba pyramids, the term mastaba (Arabic for bench)\nbeing given to the sloping-sided tombs of about 76\u00b0 angle and from 10 to\n20 ft.The annexed plan and section of Sakkara (Woodcut Nos.9 and 10), both to\nthe scale of 100 ft.to 1 in., show the peculiar nature of their\nconstruction, which seems to have been cumulative; that is to say, they\nhave been enlarged in successive periods, the original casing of the\nearlier portions having been traced.Petrie says: \u201cBoth of these\nstructures have been several times finished, each time with a\nclose-jointed polished casing of the finest white limestone, and then,\nafter each completion, it has been again enlarged by another coat of\nrough masonry and another line casing outside.\u201d\n\nThese two pyramids are the only two genuine stepped pyramids, all the\nothers having had an uniform casing on one <DW72> (excepting Dahshur, as\nabove mentioned).The Pyramid of Sakkara is the only pyramid that does\nnot face exactly north and south.It is nearly of the same general\ndimensions as the Third Pyramid, that of Mycerinus; but its outline, the\ndisposition of its chambers, and the hieroglyphics found in its\ninterior, all would seem to point it out as an imitation of the older\nform of mausolea by some king of a far more modern date.Flinders Petrie\u2019s discoveries in 1891 determined the age and the\nconstruction of the Pyramid of Medum,[37] erected by Seneferu, a king of\nthe third dynasty, being therefore the oldest pyramid known.Its\nconstruction resembles that of the small pyramid of Rikheh and the\noblong step pyramid of Sakkara, that is to say, it is a cumulative\nmastaba, the primal mastaba being about 150 ft.square, and from 37 to\n45 ft.The outer coatings added were seven in number, and the\noriginal mass was carried up and heightened as the circuit was\nincreased, and lastly an outer casing covered over all the steps which\nhad resulted during the construction.The average length of the base was\n473 ft.6 in., the total height being 301 ft.Petrie, the Pyramid of Medum, as those of Sakkara and Rikheh, were of a\ntransitional form, in which the original mastaba had been greatly\nenlarged and subsequently covered over with a casing of pyramidal\noutline.\u201cThat type once arrived at, there was no need for subsequent\nkings to retain the mastaba form internally, and Khufu and his\nsuccessors laid out their pyramids of full size at first and built them\nup at an angle of 51\u00b0, and not at 75\u00b0, that which is found in the\nordinary mastabas.\u201d Mr.Petrie also discovered the temple of the pyramid\nin the middle of its east side, and almost uninjured.It consisted of a\npassage entered at the south end of east front, then a small chamber and\na courtyard adjoining the side of the pyramid, containing two steles and\none altar between them.In the sepulchral pit of Rahotep, near the pyramid, Mr.Petrie found two\narches thrown across a passage to relieve the thrust of the overlapping\nsides, which carries the use of that feature back to the 4th dynasty.Around the Pyramids from Abouraash, north of Gizeh to Medum, south of\nSakkara, a distance of over 15 miles, forming the Necropolis of Memphis,\nnumberless smaller sepulchres are found, which appear to have been\nappropriated to private individuals, as the pyramids were\u2014so far as we\ncan ascertain\u2014reserved for kings, or, at all events, for persons of\nroyal blood.These tombs are now known under the term of mastabas, to\nwhich we have already referred.The mastaba is a rectangular building\nvarying in size from 15 to 150 ft.in width and length, and from 10 to\n80 ft.Their general form is that of a truncated pyramid with\nan angle of 75\u00b0 to the horizon, low, and looking exceedingly like a\nhouse with sloping walls, with only one door leading to the interior,\nthough they may contain several apartments, and no attempt is made to\nconceal the entrance.The chambers consist (1) of reception rooms and\n(2) of serdabs, which are closed cells containing the terra-cotta\nstatuettes which represent the Ka\u2019s or doubles of the deceased.These\nchambers occupy a part only of the mastaba, the remainder being solid\nmasonry or brickwork.The body seems to have been hidden from\nprofanation by being hid in a pit sunk in the rock, the entrance to\nwhich was concealed, and could be approached only through the solid core\nof the mastaba.Unlike the pyramids, the walls are covered with the paintings above\nalluded to, and everything in this \u201ceternal dwelling\u201d[38] of the dead is\nmade to resemble the abodes of the living; as was afterwards the case\nwith the Etruscans.It is owing to this circumstance that we are able\nnot only to realise so perfectly the civil life of the Egyptians at this\nperiod, but to fix the dates of the whole series by identifying the\nnames of the kings who built the pyramids with those on the walls of the\ntombs that surround them.[39]\n\nLike all early architecture, that of these tombs shows evident symptoms\nof having been borrowed from a wooden original.The lintels of the\ndoorways are generally rounded, and the walls mere square posts, grooved\nand jointed together, every part of it being as unlike a stone\narchitecture as can possibly be conceived.Yet the pyramids themselves,\nand those tombs which are found outside them, are generally far removed\nfrom the forms employed in timber structures; and it is only when we\nfind the Egyptians indulging in decorative art that we trace this more\nprimitive style.There are two doorways of this class in the British\nMuseum and many in that of Berlin.One engraved in Lepsius\u2019s work\n(Woodcut No.11) gives a fair idea of this style of decorative art, in\nthe most elaborate form in which we now know it.It is possible that\nsome of its forms may have been derived from brick architecture, but the\nlintel certainly was of wood, and so it may be suspected were the\nmajority of its features.It certainly is a transitional form, and\nthough we only find it in stone, none of its peculiarities were derived\nfrom lithic arts.Perhaps one of the best illustrations of the\narchitectural forms of that day was the sarcophagus of Mycerinus,\nunfortunately lost on its way to England.It represented a palace, with\nall the peculiarities found on a larger scale in the buildings which\nsurround the pyramid, and with that peculiar cornice and still more\nsingular roll or ligature on the angles, most evidently a carpentry\nform, but which the style retained to its latest day.Sarcophagus of Mycerinus, found in Third Pyramid.]In many of these tombs square piers are found supporting the roofs\nsometimes, but rarely, with an abacus, and generally without any carved\nwork, though it is more than probable they were originally painted with\nsome device, upon which they depended for their ornament.In most\ninstances they look more like fragments of a wall, of which the\nintervening spaces had been cut away, than pillars in the sense in which\nwe usually understand the word; and in every case in the early ages they\nmust be looked upon more as utilitarian expedients than as parts of an\nornamental style of architecture.Till recently no temples had been discovered which could with certainty\nbe ascribed to the age of the pyramid builders; one, however, was\nexcavated in 1853, from the sand close beside the great Sphinx, with\nwhich it was thought at one time to have been connected.Petrie,\nhowever, found the remains of a causeway 15 ft.wide and over a quarter\nof a mile long, leading to a second temple in front of the pyramid of\nKhafra; as also the traces of other temples in front of the Great\nPyramid and of that of Menkaura.Further temples have been discovered at\nAbouseer, Dahshur and other pyramids, so that, as Mr.209, \u201cto understand the purpose of the erection of the Pyramids it\nshould be observed that each has a temple on the eastern side of it.Of\nthe temples of the second and third Pyramids the ruins still remain; and\nof the temple of the Great Pyramid the basalt pavement and numerous\nblocks of granite show its site.\u201d \u201cThe worship of the deified king was\ncarried on in the temple, looking toward the Pyramid which stood on the\nwest of it; just as private individuals worshipped their ancestors in\nthe family tombs\u201d (already referred to) \u201clooking towards the false\ndoors[40] which are placed in the west side of the tomb, and which\nrepresent the entrances to the hidden sepulchres.\u201d\n\n[Illustration: 13.The temple of the Sphinx,[41] (or, as it is now called, the granite\ntemple,) though at present almost buried, was apparently a free-standing\nbuilding, a mass of masonry, the outer surfaces of which were built in\nlimestone, and carved with long grooves, horizontal and vertical,\nskilfully crossed, resembling therefore the carved fronts of many tombs\nat Sakkara and Gizeh and the sarcophagus of Mycerinus (Woodcut No.in each direction, and the walls were 40 ft.It was arranged in two storeys, the upper one being an open court.In the lower storey were: A, a hall 55 ft.high, with two rows of massive granite piers supporting beams\nof the same material to carry the stone roof: B, a second hall into\nwhich the first hall opened, and at right angles to it, measuring 81 ft.high, with one row of granite piers down\nthe centre; both of these being lighted by narrow slits just below the\ngranite roof:[42] C, a side chamber with six loculi, in two levels, each\n19 ft.long: D, a sloping passage lined with granite and oriental\nalabaster, leading to the causeway which placed it in communication with\nthe Second Pyramid, and: E, a hall 60 ft.high (rising therefore above the pavement of the upper court), with a\nlarge recess at each end containing a statue.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.These recesses were high\nabove doors which led to smaller chambers also containing statues.The internal walls were lined with immense blocks of granite from Syene\nand of alabaster beautifully polished, but with sloping joints and\nuneven beds, a form of masonry not unknown in that age.No sculpture or\ninscription of any sort is found on the walls of the temple,[43] or\nornament or symbol in the sanctuary.Statues and tablets of Khafra, the\nbuilder of the Second Pyramid, were found in the well, and this, and the\nfact that the causeway extended to the temple in front of his pyramid,\nshows clearly that it belonged to his time.[44]\n\n\nIn the present transitional state of our knowledge of the architectural\nart of the pyramid builders, it is difficult to form any distinct\njudgment as to its merits.The early Egyptians built neither for beauty\nnor for use, but for eternity, and to this last they sacrificed every\nother feeling.In itself nothing can be less artistic than a pyramid.A\ntower, either round or square, or of any other form, and of the same\ndimensions, would have been far more imposing, and if of sufficient\nheight\u2014the mass being the same\u2014might almost have attained sublimity; but\na pyramid never looks so large as it is, and not till you almost touch\nit can you realise its vast dimensions.This is owing principally to all\nits parts sloping away from the eye instead of boldly challenging\nobservation; but, on the other hand, no form is so stable, none so\ncapable of resisting the injuries of time or force, and none,\nconsequently, so well calculated to attain the object for which the\npyramids were erected.As examples of technic art, they are unrivalled\namong the works of men, but they rank low if judged by the \u00e6sthetic\nrules of architectural art.The same may be said of the tombs around them: they are low and solid,\nbut possess neither beauty of form nor any architectural feature worthy\nof attention or admiration, but they have lasted nearly uninjured from\nthe remotest antiquity, and thus have attained the object their builders\nhad principally in view in designing them.Their temple architecture, on the other hand, may induce us to modify\nconsiderably these opinions.The one described above\u2014which is the only\none I personally have any knowledge of\u2014is perhaps the simplest and least\nadorned temple in the world.All its parts are plain\u2014straight and\nsquare, without a single moulding of any sort, but they are perfectly\nproportioned to the work they have to do.They are pleasingly and\neffectively arranged, and they have all that lithic grandeur which is\ninherent in large masses of precious materials.Such a temple as that near the Sphinx cannot compete either in richness\nor magnificence with the great temples of Thebes, with their sculptured\ncapitals and storied walls, but there is a beauty of repose and an\nelegance of simplicity about the older example which goes far to redeem\nits other deficiencies, and when we have more examples before us they\nmay rise still higher in our estimation.Whatever opinion we may ultimately form regarding their architecture,\nthere can be little doubt as to the rank to be assigned to their\npainting and sculpture.In these two arts the Egyptians early attained a\nmastery which they never surpassed.Judged by the rules of classic or of\nmodern art, it appears formal and conventional to such an extent as to\nrender it difficult for us now to appreciate its merits.But as a purely\nPhonetic form of art\u2014as used merely to enunciate those ideas which we\nnow so much more easily express by alphabetic writings\u2014it is clear and\nprecise beyond any picture-writings the world has since seen.Judged by\nits own rules, it is marvellous to what perfection the Egyptians had\nattained at that early period, and if we look on their minor edifices as\nmere vehicles for the display of this pictorial expression, we must\nmodify to some extent the judgment we would pass on them as mere objects\nof architectural art.XITH AND XIITH DYNASTY OF MANETHO.Sankhkara                 reigned 46 years.Amenemhat                 reigned 38 years.Osirtasen                 reigned 48 years.(Lampares) reigned  8 years.The great culminating period of the old kingdom of Egypt is that\nbelonging to the 4th and 5th dynasties.Nine-tenths of the monuments of\nthe pyramid-builders which have come down to our time belong to the five\ncenturies during which these two dynasties ruled over Egypt (B.C.The 6th dynasty was of a southern and more purely African origin.On the\ntablets of Apap[45] (Apophis), its most famous monarch, we find the\nworship of Khem and other deities of the Theban period wholly unknown to\nthe pyramid kings.The next four dynasties are of _fain\u00e9ant_ kings, of\nwhom we know little, not \u201cCarent quia vate sacro,\u201d but because they were\nnot builders, and their memory is lost.The 11th and 12th usher in a new\nstate of affairs.The old Memphite pyramid-building kingdom had passed,\nwith its peaceful contentment, and had given place to a warlike\nidolatrous race of Theban kings, far more purely African, the prototypes\nof the great monarchy of the 18th and 19th dynasties, and having no\naffinity with anything we know of as existing in Asia in those times.Their empire lasted apparently for more than 300 years in Upper Egypt;\nbut for the latter portion of that period they do not seem to have\nreigned over the whole country, having been superseded in Lower Egypt by\nthe invasion of the hated Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, about the year 2300\nB.C., and by whom they also were finally totally overthrown.When we turn from the contemplation of the pyramids, and the monuments\ncontemporary with them, to examine those of the 12th dynasty, we become\nat once aware of the change which has taken place.Instead of the\npyramids, all of which are situated on the western side of the Nile, we\nhave obelisks, which, without a single exception, are found on its\neastern side towards the rising sun, apparently in contradistinction to\nthe valley of the dead, which was towards the side on which he set.The\nearliest and one of the finest of these obelisks is that still standing\nat Heliopolis, inscribed with the name of Osirtasen, one of the first\nand greatest kings of this dynasty.in height,\nwithout the pyramidion which crowns it, and is a splendid block of\ngranite, weighing 217 tons.It must have required immense skill to\nquarry it, to transport it from Syene, and finally, after finishing it,\nto erect it where it now stands and has stood for 4500 years.We find the sculptures of the same king at Wady Halfah, near the second\ncataract, in Nubia; and at Sarabout el Kadem, in the Sinaitic Peninsula.He also commenced the great temple of Karnac at Thebes, which in the\nhands of his successors became the most splendid in Egypt, and perhaps\nit is not too much to say the greatest architectural monument in the\nwhole world.As might be expected, from our knowledge of the fact that the Hyksos\ninvasion took place so soon after his reign, none of his structural\nbuildings now remain entire in which we might read the story of his\nconquests, and learn to which gods of the Pantheon he especially devoted\nhimself.We must therefore fall back on Manetho for an account of his\n\u201cconquering all Asia in the space of nine years, and Europe as far as\nThrace.\u201d[46] While there is nothing to contradict this statement, there\nis much that renders it extremely probable.It is to this dynasty also that we owe the erection of the Labyrinth,\none of the most remarkable, as well as one of the most mysterious\nmonuments of Egypt.All Manetho tells us of this is, that Lampares, or\nM\u0153ris, \u201cbuilt it as a sepulchre for himself;\u201d and the information we\nderive from the Greeks on this subject is so contradictory and so full\nof the wonderful, that it is extremely difficult to make out either the\nplan or the purpose of the building.As long ago as 1843, the whole site\nwas excavated and thoroughly explored by the officers of the Prussian\nexpedition under Lepsius; but, like most of the information obtained by\nthat ill-conditioned party, such data as have been given are of the most\nunsatisfactory and fragmentary form.The position which Lepsius claimed\nfor the Labyrinth has been found by Mr.Petrie[47] to be incorrect; the\nremains supposed to be those of the walls and chambers are of much later\ndate, being only the houses and tombs of the population which destroyed\nthe great structure.The village thus created was established on the\nouter portion of the site when the destruction of the buildings was\nfirst commenced.Petrie calculates that the Labyrinth was\nsymmetrical with the pyramid, and had the same axis: that it occupied a\nsite of about 1000 feet wide by 800 ft.deep; thus covering an area\nsufficiently large to accommodate all the Theban temples on the east\nbank, and in addition one of the largest on the west bank.The essential\ndifference between the Labyrinth and all other temples was that it\nconsisted of a series of eighteen large peristylar courts with\nsanctuaries and other chambers.Of these, according to Herodotus, there\nwere six, side by side, facing north; six others, opposite, facing\nsouth, and a wall surrounding the whole.Herodotus, however, was allowed\nto see portions only of the Labyrinth, probably those nearest to the\nentrance.Beyond this, on the north side, Mr.Petrie suggests the\nexistence of a third series of peristylar courts (described by Strabo),\nwith sanctuaries and other chambers, and south of these, halls of\ncolumns, and smaller halls, through which Strabo entered.In the hall of\ntwenty-seven columns, mentioned by Strabo, Mr.Petrie places the columns\nin one row to form a vestibule to the entrances to the courts similar to\nthe temple of Abydos.The whole disposition of the plan, the style of\nthe courts and their peristyles must be conjectural, as no remains of\nblocks of stone or columns in sufficient preservation have been found on\nwhich to base a restoration.On some architrave blocks were found\ninscriptions of Amenemhat III.The last remains were\ntaken away within our own time by the engineers of the new railway, and\napparently with the consent of the officials of the Boulak Museum, who\nreported that they had been quarried from the native rock.The Hawara Pyramid, on the north of the Labyrinth, and erected by the\nsame King Amenemhat III., has been examined by Mr.[48] As the rock on which it was built was little more than\nhardened sand, a pit was excavated, into which a monolithic chamber of\ngranite, brought from Upper Egypt, and weighing 100 tons, was lowered.The sarcophagus and two other coffins having been placed in it, the\nchamber was covered over with three granite beams, 4 feet thick, one of\nwhich was raised in a hollow chamber, and supported there till after the\nKing\u2019s death and the deposit of his body in the sarcophagus.Round the\ngranite monolith were built walls which carried two courses of stone\nblocks, the lower horizontal, the upper courses sloping one against the\nother, as in the Great Pyramid.The rest of the pyramid was constructed\nin brick, and to prevent the brickwork settling down and splitting on\nthe pointed roof-stones, an arch of five courses of brick, measuring 3\nfeet deep, was thrown across, resting on bricks laid in mud between the\narch and the stonework.The brickwork above the arch was laid in sand,\nand the whole pyramid covered with a casing of limestone.Petrie calculates to have been about 334 ft.A second pyramid belonging to this dynasty, and erected by Osirtasen\nII., has also been examined and described by Mr.[49] This\npyramid (Illahun) is of peculiar construction, being partly composed of\nthe natural rock dressed into form to a height of 40 feet, above which\nrose the built portion, which was different from that of any other\npyramid, being built with a framing of cross walls.The walls ran right\nthrough the diagonals up to the top of the building, and had offset\nwalls at right angles to the sides, the walls being of stone in the\nlower part, and brick above; the filling-in between the walls was of mud\nand brick, and the whole pyramid, brick, stone, and rock, was covered\nwith a casing of limestone.Petrie in the Fayum[50] was\nthe finding of the plan, more or less complete, of the town or village\nof Kahun, which was built for the workmen and overseers of the Illahun\npyramid, and deserted shortly after its completion.The plan would seem\nto have been laid out from one design, and consisted: of an acropolis or\nraised space, where the house of the chief controller of the works was\nplaced, and which might have been occupied by the King when he came to\ninspect the works: a series of large houses (Woodcut No.14), arranged\nvery much in the same way as those of Pompeii, and containing a great\nnumber of halls, courts, and rooms; and many streets of workmen\u2019s\ndwellings of two or three rooms each.The walls were all built in crude\nbrick, the rooms being covered over with roofs formed of beams of wood,\non which poles were placed, and to these bundles of straw and reeds\nlashed down, the whole being covered inside and outside with mud.In\nthose rooms, which exceeded 8 or 9 ft.in width, columns of stone or\nwood were employed to assist in carrying the roof; such columns being\noctagonal or with sixteen sides, fluted or ribbed like the reed or lotus\ncolumn at Beni-Hasan.The lower portion of a fluted column in wood was\nfound, existing still in situ on its base, which shows that description\nof column to have had a wooden origin.The most interesting series of monuments of this dynasty which have come\ndown to our time are the tombs of Beni-Hasan, in Middle Egypt.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.They are\nsituated on the eastern side of the Nile, as are also those of\nTel-el-Amarna, Sheykh-Said, K\u00f4m-el-ahman, and others.The character of\nthe sculptures which adorn their walls approaches that found in the\ntombs surrounding the pyramids, but the architecture differs widely.They are all cheerful-looking halls, open to the light of day, many of\nthem with pillared porches, and all possessing pretensions to\narchitectural ornament, either internal or external.One of the most interesting of the tombs has in front of it a\nportico-in-", "question": "Where is John?

Mariette to identify San, Zoan, or Tanis, a well-known site\non the Bubastite branch of the Nile, with this Avaris.And already he\nhas disinterred a sphinx and two seated statues which certainly belong\nto the reign of the Shepherd king Apophis.[53]\n\nThe character of these differs widely from anything hitherto found in\nEgypt.They present a physiognomy strongly marked with an Asiatic\ntype\u2014an arched nose, rude bushy hair, and great muscular development;\naltogether something wholly different from everything else found in\nEgypt either before or afterwards.This is not much, but it is an earnest that more remains to be\ndiscovered, and adds another to the proofs that are daily accumulating,\nhow implicitly Manetho may be relied upon when we only read him\ncorrectly, and how satisfactory it is to find that every discovery that\nis made confirms the conclusions we had hesitatingly been adopting.It appears from such fragmentary evidence as has hitherto been gleaned\nfrom the monuments, that the Shepherds\u2019 invasion was neither sudden nor\nat once completely successful, if indeed it ever was so, for it is\ncertain that Theban and Xoite dynasties co-existed with the Shepherds\nduring the whole period of their stay, either from policy, like the\nprotected princes under our sway in India, or because their conquest was\nnot so complete as to enable them to suppress the national dynasties\naltogether.Like the Tartars in China they seem to have governed the country by\nmeans of the original inhabitants, but for their own purposes;\ntolerating their religion and institutions, but ruling by the superior\nenergy of their race the peace-loving semi-Semitic inhabitants of the\nDelta, till they were in their turn overthrown and expelled by the more\nwarlike but more purely African races of the southern division of the\nEgyptian valley.PRINCIPAL KINGS OF THE GREAT THEBAN PERIOD.1830\n\n  Amenhotep I.         reigned 25 years.Thothmes I.          reigned 13 years.Hatshepsu (Queen)    reigned 21 years.Horemheb (Horus)     reigned 36 years.Rameses I.           reigned 12 years.Meneptah I.          reigned 32 years.1312\n\n          XXTH DYNASTY.Rhampsinitus-Rameses reigned 55 years.Ramessid\u00e6            reigned 66 years.Amenophis            reigned 20 years.The five centuries[54] which elapsed between the expulsion of the\nShepherds and Exode of the Jews comprise the culminating period of the\ngreatness and greatest artistic development of the Egyptians.It is\npractically within this period that all the great buildings of the\n\u201cHundred pyloned city of Thebes\u201d were erected.Memphis was adorned\nwithin its limits with buildings as magnificent as those of the southern\ncapital, though subsequently less fortunate in escaping the hand of the\nspoiler; and in every city of the Delta wherever an obelisk or\nsculptured stone is found, there we find almost invariably the name of\none of the kings of the 18th or 19th dynasties.In Arabia, too, and\nabove the cataracts of the far-off Mero\u00eb, everywhere their works and\nnames are found.At Arban,[55] on the Khabour, we find the name of the\nthird Thothmes; and there seems little doubt but that the Naharaina or\nMesopotamia was one of the provinces conquered by them, and that all\nWestern Asia was more or less subject to their sway.Whoever the conquering Thebans may have been, their buildings are\nsufficient to prove, as above mentioned, that they belonged to a race\ndiffering in many essential respects from that of the Memphite kingdom\nthey had superseded.The pyramid has disappeared as a form of royal sepulchre, to be replaced\nby a long gloomy corridor cut in the rock; its walls covered with wild\nand fetish pictures of death and judgment: a sort of magic hall, crowded\nwith mysterious symbols the most monstrous and complicated that any\nsystem of human superstition has yet invented.Instead of the precise orientation and careful masonry of the old\nkingdom, the buildings of the new race are placed anywhere, facing in\nany direction, and generally affected with a symmetriphobia that it is\ndifficult to understand.The pylons are seldom in the axis of the\ntemples; the courts seldom square; the angles frequently not right\nangles, and one court succeeding another without the least reference to\nsymmetry.The masonry, too, is frequently of the rudest and clumsiest sort, and\nwould long ago have perished but for its massiveness: and there is in\nall their works an appearance of haste and want of care that sometimes\ngoes far to mar the value of their grandest conceptions.In their manners, too, there seems an almost equal degree of\ndiscrepancy.War was the occupation of the kings, and foreign conquest\nseems to have been the passion of the people.The pylons and the walls\nof the temples are covered with battle-scenes, or with the enumeration\nof the conquests made, or the tribute brought by the subjected races.While not engaged in this, the monarch\u2019s time seems to have been devoted\nto practising the rites of the most complicated and least rational form\nof idolatry that has yet been known to exist among any body of men in\nthe slightest degree civilised.If the monuments of Memphis had come down to our times as perfect as\nthose of Thebes, some of these differences might be found less striking.On the other hand, others might be still more apparent; but judging from\nsuch data as we possess\u2014and they are tolerably extensive and complete\u2014we\nare justified in assuming a most marked distinction; and it is\nindispensably necessary to bear it in mind in attempting to understand\nthe architecture of the valley of the Nile, and equally important in any\nattempt to trace the affinities of the Egyptian with any other races of\nmankind.So far as we can now see, it may be possible to trace some\naffinities with the pyramid builders in Assyria or in Western Asia; but\nif any can be dimly predicated of the southern Egyptian race, it is in\nIndia and the farther east; and the line of communication was not the\nIsthmus of Suez, but the Straits of Babelmandeb and the Indian Ocean.Although, as already mentioned, numerous buildings of the great\nPharaonic dynasties are to be found scattered all along the banks of the\nNile, it is at Thebes only that the temples are so complete as to enable\nus to study them with advantage, or to arrive at a just appreciation of\ntheir greatness.That city was practically the capital of Egypt during\nthe whole of the 18th and 19th dynasties, and has been fortunate in\nhaving had no great city built near it since it fell into decay; unlike\nMemphis in this respect, which has been used as a quarry during the last\n14 or 15 centuries.It has also had the advantage of a barrier of rocky\nhills on its western limits, which has prevented the sand of the desert\nfrom burying its remains, as has been the case at Abydus and elsewhere.The ruins that still remain are found scattered over an area extending\nabout 2\u00bc miles north and south, and 3\u00bd miles east and west.The\nprincipal group is at Karnac, on the eastern bank of the Nile,\nconsisting of one great temple 1200 feet long, and five or six smaller\ntemples grouped unsymmetrically around it.About two miles farther south\nis the temple at Luxor 820 feet long, and without any dependencies.On the other side of the river is the great temple of Medeenet-Hab\u00fb,\nbuilt by the first king of the 19th dynasty, 520 feet in length; the\nRameseum, 570 feet long, and the temple at Koorneh, of which only the\nsanctuary and the foundations of the Propyla now exist.Of the great\ntemple of Thothmes and Amenophis very little remains above ground\u2014it\nhaving been situated within the limits of the inundation\u2014except the two\ncelebrated colossi, one of which was known to the Greeks as the vocal\nMemnon.When complete it probably was, next after Karnac, the most\nextensive of Theban temples.There are several others, situated at the\nfoot of the Libyan hills, which would be considered as magnificent\nelsewhere, but sink into insignificance when compared with those just\nenumerated.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.Central Pillar, from Rameseum, Thebes.]Most of these, like our medi\u00e6val cathedrals, are the work of successive\nkings, who added to the works of their ancestors without much reference\nto congruity of plan; but one, the Rameseum, was built wholly by the\ngreat Rameses in the 15th century B.C., and though the inner sanctuary\nis so ruined that it can hardly be restored, still the general\narrangement, as shown in the annexed woodcut, is so easily made out that\nit may be considered as a typical example of what an Egyptian temple of\nthis age was intended to have been.Its fa\u00e7ade is formed by two great\npylons, or pyramidal masses of masonry, which, like the two western\ntowers of a Gothic cathedral, are the appropriate and most imposing part\nof the structure externally.Between these is the entrance doorway,\nleading, as is almost invariably the case, into a great square\ncourtyard, with porticoes always on two, and sometimes on three, sides.This leads to an inner court, smaller, but far more splendid than the\nfirst.On the two sides of this court, through which the central passage\nleads, are square piers with colossi in front, and on the right and left\nare double ranges of circular columns, which are continued also behind\nthe square piers fronting the entrance.Passing through this, we come to\na hypostyle hall of great beauty, formed by two ranges of larger columns\nin the centre, and three rows of smaller ones on each side.These\nhypostyle halls almost always accompany the larger Egyptian temples of\nthe great age.They derive their name from having, over the lateral\ncolumns, what in Gothic architecture would be called a _clerestory_,\nthrough which the light is admitted to the central portion of the hall.Although some are more extensive than this, the arrangement of all is\nnearly similar.They all possess two ranges of columns in the centre, so\ntall as to equal the height of the side columns together with that of\nthe attic which is placed on them.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.They are generally of different\norders; the central pillars having a bell-shaped capital, the under side\nof which was perfectly illuminated from the mode in which the light was\nintroduced; while in the side pillars the capital was narrower at the\ntop than at the bottom, apparently for the sake of allowing its\nornaments to be seen.Beyond this are always several smaller apartments, in this instance\nsupposed to be nine in number, but they are so ruined that it is\ndifficult to be quite certain what their arrangement was.These seem to\nhave been rather suited to the residences of the king or priests than to\nthe purposes of a temple, as we understand the word.Indeed,\nPalace-Temple, or Temple-Palace, would be a more appropriate term for\nthese buildings than to call them simply Temples.They do not seem to\nhave been appropriated to the worship of any particular god, but rather\nfor the great ceremonials of royalty\u2014of kingly sacrifice to the gods for\nthe people, and of worship of the king himself by the people, who seems\nto have been regarded, if not as a god, at least as the representative\nof the gods on earth.Though the Rameseum is so grand from its dimensions, and so beautiful\nfrom its design, it is far surpassed in every respect by the\npalace-temple at Karnac, which is perhaps the noblest effort of\narchitectural magnificence ever produced by the hand of man.in length, by about 360 in width,\nand it covers therefore about 430,000 square ft., or nearly twice the\narea of St.Peter\u2019s at Rome, and more than four times that of any\nmedi\u00e6val cathedral existing.This, however, is not a fair way of\nestimating its dimensions, for our churches are buildings entirely under\none roof; but at Karnac a considerable portion of the area was uncovered\nby any buildings, so that no comparison is just.The great hypostyle\nhall, however, is internally 330 ft.by 170, and, with its two pylons,\nit covers more than 85,000 square feet\u2014nearly as large as Cologne, one\nof the largest of our northern cathedrals; and when we consider that\nthis is only a part of a great whole, we may fairly assert that the\nentire structure is among the largest, as it undoubtedly is one of the\nmost beautiful, buildings in the world.The original part of this great group was, as before mentioned, the\nsanctuary or temple built by Osirtasen, the great monarch of the 12th\ndynasty, before the Shepherd invasion.It is the only thing that seems\nto have been allowed to stand during the five centuries of Shepherd\ndomination, though it is by no means clear that it had not been pulled\ndown by the Shepherds, and reinstated by the first kings of the 18th\ndynasty, an operation easily performed with the beautiful polished\ngranite masonry of the sanctuary.Be this as it may, Amenhotep, the\nfirst king of the restored race, enclosed this in a temple about 120 ft.Thothmes I. built in front of it a splendid hall, surrounded by\ncolossi, backed by piers; and Thothmes III.erected behind it a palace\nor temple, which is one of the most singular buildings in Egypt.long by 55 in width internally, the roof is supported by\ntwo rows of massive square columns, and two of circular pillars of most\nexceptional form, the capitals of which are reversed, and somewhat\nresembling the form usually found in Assyria, but nowhere else in Egypt.Like almost all Egyptian halls, it was lighted from the roof in the\nmanner shown in the section.With all these additions, the temple was a\ncomplete whole, 540 ft.in length by 280 in width, at the time when the\nSun-worshippers broke in upon the regular succession of the great 18th\ndynasty.Section of Palace of Thothmes III., Thebes.]When the original line was resumed, Meneptah commenced the building of\nthe great hall, which he nearly completed.Rameses, the first king of\nthe 19th dynasty, built the small temple in front; and the so-called\nBubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty added the great court in front,\ncompleting the building to the extent we now find it.We have thus, as\nin some of our medi\u00e6val cathedrals, in this one temple a complete\nhistory of the style during the whole of its most flourishing period;\nand, either for interest or for beauty, it forms such a series as no\nother country, and no other age, can produce.Besides those buildings\nmentioned above, there are other temples to the north, to the east, and\nmore especially to the south, and pylons connecting these, and avenues\nof sphinxes extending for miles, and enclosing-walls, and tanks, and\nembankments\u2014making up such a group as no city ever possessed before or\nsince.Peter\u2019s, with its colonnades, and the Vatican, make up an\nimmense mass, but as insignificant in extent as in style when compared\nwith this glory of ancient Thebes and its surrounding temples.Plan of Hypostyle Hall at Karnac.Section of central portion of Hypostyle Hall at\nKarnac.The culminating point and climax of all this group of building is the\nhypostyle hall of Meneptah.The plan and section of its central portion\non the next page, both to the usual scale, will explain its general\narrangement; but no language can convey an idea of its beauty, and no\nartist has yet been able to reproduce its form so as to convey to those\nwho have not seen it an idea of its grandeur.The mass of its central\npiers, illumined by a flood of light from the clerestory, and the\nsmaller pillars of the wings gradually fading into obscurity, are so\narranged and lighted as to convey an idea of infinite space; at the same\ntime, the beauty and massiveness of the forms, and the brilliancy of\ntheir  decorations, all combine to stamp this as the greatest of\nman\u2019s architectural works; but such a one as it would be impossible to\nreproduce, except in such a climate and in that individual style in\nwhich, and for which, it was created.Caryatide Pillar, from the Great Court at\nMedeenet-Hab\u00fb.]On the same side of the Nile, and probably at one time connected with it\nby an avenue of sphinxes, stands the temple of Luxor, hardly inferior in\nsome respects to its great rival at Karnac; but either it was never\nfinished, or, owing to its proximity to the Nile, it has been ruined,\nand the materials carried away.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.The length is about 830 ft., its breadth\nranging from 100 to 200 ft.Its general arrangement comprised, first, a\ngreat court at a different angle from the rest, being turned so as to\nface Karnac.In front of this stand two colossi of Rameses the Great,\nits founder, and two obelisks were once also there, one of which is now\nin Paris.Behind this was once a great hypostyle hall, but only the two\ncentral ranges of columns are now standing.Still further back were\nsmaller halls and numerous apartments, evidently meant for the king\u2019s\nresidence, rather than for a temple or place exclusively devoted to\nworship.The palace at Luxor is further remarkable as a striking instance of how\nregardless the Egyptians were of regularity and symmetry in their plans.Not only is there a considerable angle in the direction of the axis of\nthe building, but the angles of the courtyards are in scarcely any\ninstance right angles; the pillars are variously spaced, and pains seem\nto have been gratuitously taken to make it as irregular as possible in\nnearly every respect.All the portion at the southern end was erected by\nAmenhotep III., the northern part completed by Rameses the Great, the\nsame who built the Rameseum already described as situated on the other\nbank of the Nile.Besides these there stood on the western side of the Nile the Memnonium,\nor great temple of Amenhotep III., now almost entirely ruined.It was\nplaced on the alluvial plain, within the limits of the inundation, which\nhas tended on the one hand to bury it, and on the other to facilitate\nthe removal of its materials.Nearly the only remains of it now apparent\nare the two great seated colossi of its founder, one of which, when\nbroken, became in Greek, or rather Roman times, the vocal Memnon, whose\nplaintive wail to the rising sun, over its own and its country\u2019s\ndesolation, forms so prominent an incident in the Roman accounts of\nThebes.[56]\n\n[Illustration: 25.Section through Hall of Columns, South Temple of\nKarnac.Not far from this stands the great temple known as that of\nMedeenet-Hab\u00fb, built by the first king of the 19th dynasty.Its\ndimensions are only slightly inferior to those of the Rameseum, being\n520 ft.from front to rear, and its propylon 107 ft.Its two great\ncourts are, however, inferior in size to those of that building.The\ninner one is adorned by a series of Caryatide figures (Woodcut No.24),\nwhich are inferior both in conception and execution to those of the\nprevious reigns; and indeed throughout the whole building there is an\nabsence of style, and an exaggeration of detail, which shows only too\nclearly that the great age was passing away when it was erected.The\nroof of its hypostyle hall, and of the chambers beyond it, is occupied\nby an Arab village, which would require to be cleared away before it\ncould be excavated; much as this might be desired, the details of its\ncourts would not lead us to expect anything either very beautiful or new\nfrom its disinterment.Further down the river, as already mentioned,\nstood another temple, that of Koorneh, built by the same Meneptah who\nerected the great hall of Karnac.It is, however, only a fragment, or\nwhat may be called the residential part of a temple.The hypostyle hall\nnever was erected, and only the foundations of two successive pylons can\nbe traced in front of it.In its present condition, therefore, it is one\nof the least interesting of the temples of Thebes, though elsewhere it\nwould no doubt be regarded with wonder.Another building of this age, attached to the southern side of the great\ntemple of Karnac, deserves especial attention as being a perfectly\nregular building, erected at one time, and according to the original\ndesign, and strictly a temple, without anything about it that could\njustify the supposition of its being a palace.It was erected by the first king of the 19th dynasty, and consists of\ntwo pylons, approached through an avenue of sphinxes.Within this is an\nhyp\u00e6thral court, and beyond that a small hypostyle hall, lighted from\nabove, as shown in the section (Woodcut No.Within this is the\ncell, surrounded by a passage, and with a smaller hall beyond, all\napparently dark, or very imperfectly lighted.The gateway in front of\nthe avenue was erected by the Ptolemys, and, like many Egyptian\nbuildings, is placed at a different angle to the direction of the\nbuilding itself.Besides its intrinsic beauty, this temple is\ninteresting as being far more like the temples erected afterwards under\nthe Greek and Roman domination than anything else belonging to that\nearly age.At Tanis, or Zoan, near the mouth of the Nile, the remains of a temple\nand of 13 obelisks can still be traced.At Soleb, on the borders of\nNubia, a temple now stands of the Third Amenhotep, scarcely inferior in\nbeauty or magnificence to those of the capital.At Sedinga, not far below the third cataract, are the remains of temples\nerected by Amenhotep III.of the 18th dynasty, which are interesting as\nintroducing in a completed form a class of pillar that afterwards became\na great favourite with Egyptian architects (Woodcut No.Before this\ntime we find these Isis heads either painted or carved on the face of\nsquare piers, but so as not to interfere with the lines of the pillars.Gradually they became more important, so as to form a double capital, as\nin this instance.In the Roman times, as at Denderah (Woodcut No.143), all the four faces of the pier were so adorned, though it must be\nadmitted in very questionable taste.It would be tedious to attempt to enumerate without illustrating all the\nfragments that remain of temples of this age.Some are so ruined that it\nis difficult to make out their plan.Others, like those of Memphis or\nTanis, so entirely destroyed, that only their site, or at most only\ntheir leading dimensions, can be made out.Their loss is of course to be\nregretted; but those enumerated above are sufficient to enable us to\njudge both of the style and the magnificence of the great building\nepoch.At Abydus the remains of two great temples have been found; one of\nRameses II., with great court surrounded by piers with osireide figures\non them; two halls of columns, a sanctuary, and other small chambers in\nthe rear.The other, completed only and decorated with sculpture by\nRameses II., the temple having been built by his father, Sethi I. This\nsecond temple differs in the arrangement of its plan from other examples\n(Woodcut No.29); it was preceded by two great courts; at the further\nend of the second court was a peristyle with twelve piers, from which,\nthrough three doors, a hall of twenty-four columns was reached; the\ncolumns here were so arranged as to suggest seven avenues, beyond which\nwere seven doors leading to a second hall with thirty-six columns,\nsimilarly disposed to those in the first hall.These avenues led to\nseven sanctuaries, the roofs of which were segmental, the arched form of\nvault being cut out of solid blocks of stone (Woodcut No.Beyond\nthe sepulchral destination, which roofs of these sanctuaries suggest,\nnothing is known from inscriptions as to their precise use.Through one\nof the sanctuaries other halls of columns and chambers were reached\nwhich lie in the rear of the building, and on the south side, and\napproached from the second great hall of columns, many other halls,\nchambers, and staircases leading to the roof.The special interest to\nthe Egyptologist, however, of this temple lies in the fact that it was\non the walls of one of these that the so-called tablet of Abydus was\ndiscovered\u2014now in the British Museum\u2014which first gave a connected list\nof kings, the predecessors of Rameses, and sufficiently extensive to\nconfirm the lists of Manetho in a manner satisfactory to the ordinary\ninquirer.A second list, far more complete, has recently been brought to\nlight in the same locality, and contains the names of 76 kings,\nancestors of Meneptah, the father of Rameses.It begins, as all lists\ndo, with Menes; but even this list is only a selection, omitting many\nnames found in Manetho, but inserting others which are not in his\nlists.[57] Before the discovery of this perfect list, the longest known\nwere that of the chamber of the ancestors of Thothmes III., at Karnac,\ncontaining when perfect 61 names, of which, however, nearly one-third\nare obliterated; and that recently found at Saccara, containing 58 names\noriginally, but of which several are now illegible.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.It is the existence of these lists which gives such interest and such\nreality to the study of Architecture in Egypt.Fortunately there is\nhardly a building in that country which is not adorned with the name of\nthe king in whose reign it was erected.In royal buildings they are\nfound on every wall and every pillar.The older cartouches are simple\nand easily remembered; and when we find the buildings thus dated by the\nbuilders themselves, and their succession recorded by subsequent kings\non the walls of their temples, we feel perfectly certain of our\nsequence, and nearly so of the actual dates of the buildings; they are,\nmoreover, such a series as no other country in the world can match\neither for historic interest or Architectural magnificence.ROCK-CUT TOMBS AND TEMPLES.But in Egypt Proper and in Nubia the Egyptians were in the habit of\nexcavating monuments from the living rock, but with this curious\ndistinction, that, with scarcely an exception, all the excavations in\nEgypt Proper are tombs, and no important example of a rock-cut temple\nhas yet been discovered.In Nubia, on the other hand, all the\nexcavations are temples, and no tombs of importance are to be found\nanywhere.This distinction may hereafter lead to important historical\ndeductions, inasmuch as on the western side of India there are an\ninfinite number of rock-cut temples, but no tombs of any sort.Every\ncircumstance seems to point to the fact that, if there was any\nconnection between Africa and India, it was with the provinces in the\nupper part of the Valley of the Nile, and not with Egypt Proper.This,\nhowever, is a subject that can hardly be entered on here, though it may\nbe useful to bear in mind the analogy alluded to.Plan and Section of Rock-cut Temple at Ab\u00fb Simbel.Like all rock-cut examples all over the world, these Nubian temples are\ncopies of structural buildings only more or less modified to suit the\nexigencies of their situation, which did not admit of any very great\ndevelopment inside, as light and air could only be introduced from the\none opening of the doorway.The two principal examples of this class of monument are the two at Ab\u00fb\nSimbel, the larger of which is the finest of its class known to exist\nanywhere.Its total depth from the face of the rock is 150 ft., divided\ninto 2 large halls and 3 cells, with passages connecting them.Externally the fa\u00e7ade is about 100 ft.in height, and adorned by 4 of\nthe most magnificent colossi in Egypt, each 70 ft.in height, and\nrepresenting the king, Rameses II., who caused the excavation to be\nmade.It may be because they are more perfect than any others now found\nin that country, but certainly nothing can exceed their calm majesty and\nbeauty, or be more entirely free from the vulgarity and exaggeration\nwhich is generally a characteristic of colossal works of this sort.The smaller temple at the same place has six standing figures of deities\ncountersunk in the rock, and is carved with exceeding richness.It is of\nthe same age with the large temple, but will not admit of comparison\nwith it owing to the inferiority of the design.Besides these, there is a very beautiful though small example at\nKalabsheh (known as the Bayt el Wellee, \u201cthe house of the saint\u201d),\nlikewise belonging to the age of Rameses II., and remarkable for the\nbeauty of its sculptural bas-reliefs, as well as for the bold\nProto-Doric columns which adorn its vestibule.There are also smaller\nones at D\u00earr and Balagne, at the upper end of the valley.At W\u00e2dy Saboua\nand Gerf Huss\u00ean, the cells of the temple have been excavated from the\nrock, but their courts and propylons are structural buildings added in\nfront\u2014a combination only found once in Egypt, at Thebes (D\u00ear-el-Bahree),\nand very rare anywhere else, although meeting the difficulties of the\ncase better than any other arrangement, inasmuch as the sanctuary has\nthus all the imperishability and mystery of a cave, and the temple at\nthe same time has the space and external appearance of a building\nstanding in the open air.This last arrangement is found also as a characteristic of the temples\nof Gebel Barkal, in the kingdom of Mero\u00eb, showing how far the\nrock-cutting practice prevailed in the Upper Valley of the Nile.The plan on which the Temple of D\u00ear-el-Bahree is constructed is curious,\nand differs entirely from that of any other in Egypt.It is built in\nstages up a <DW72> at the foot of the mountain, flights of steps leading\nfrom one court to the other.The temple was built by Queen Hatshepsu or\nAmen-noo-het, the sister of Thothmes II.and Thothmes III., and\nconsisted of three courts rising in terraces one above the other; at the\nback of these were two ranges of porticoes, the upper one set back\nbehind the lower and built into the vertical face of the rock with which\nthe sanctuary and antechambers were cut.As all the temples above\nmentioned are contemporary with the great structures in Egypt, it seems\nstrange that the eternity of a rock-cut example did not recommend this\nform of temple to the attention of the Egyptians themselves.But with\nthe exception of D\u00ear-el-Bahree and a small grotto, called the Speos\nArtemidos, near Beni-Hasan, and two small caves at Silsilis, near the\nCataract, the Egyptians seem never to have attempted it, trusting\napparently to the solidity of their masonic structures for that eternity\nof duration they aspired to.In addition to the temples above described, which are all more or less\ncomplex in plan, and all made up of various independent parts, there\nexists in Egypt a class of temples called _mammeisi_, dedicated to", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Small temples of this\nform are common to all ages, and belong as well to the 18th dynasty as\nto the time of the Ptolemys.One of them, built by Amenhotep III.at\nElephantine, is represented in plan and elevation in the annexed cut.It\nis of a simple peristylar form, with columns in front and rear, the\nlatter being now built into a wall, and seven square piers on each\nflank.These temples are all small, and, like the Typhonia, which\nsomewhat resemble them, were used as detached chapels or cells,\ndependent on the larger temples.What renders them more than usually\ninteresting to us is the fact that they were undoubtedly the originals\nof the Greek peristylar forms, that people having borrowed nearly every\npeculiarity of their architecture from the banks of the Nile.We possess\ntangible evidence of peristylar temples and Proto-Doric pillars erected\nin Egypt centuries before the oldest known specimen in Greece.We need\ntherefore hardly hesitate to award the palm of invention of these things\nto the Egyptians, as we should probably be forced to do for most of the\narts and sciences of the Greeks if we had only knowledge sufficient to\nenable us to trace the connecting links which once joined them together,\nbut which are now in most instances lost, or at least difficult to find.Of the first 10 dynasties of Egyptian kings little now remains but their\ntombs\u2014the everlasting pyramids\u2014and of the people they governed, only the\nstructures and rock-cut excavations which they prepared for their final\nresting-places.The Theban kings and their subjects erected no pyramids, and none of\ntheir tombs are structural\u2014all are excavated from the living rock; and\nfrom Beni-Hasan to the Cataract the plain of the Nile is everywhere\nfringed with these singular monuments, which, if taken in the aggregate,\nperhaps required a greater amount of labour to excavate and to adorn\nthan did even all the edifices of the plain.Certain it is that there is\nfar more to be learnt of the arts, of the habits, and of the history of\nEgypt from these tombs than from all the other monuments.No tomb of any\nTheban king has yet been discovered anterior to the 18th dynasty; but\nall the tombs of that and of the subsequent dynasty have been found, or\nare known to exist, in the Valley of Bib\u00e1n-el-Molook, on the western\nside of the plain of Thebes.It appears to have been the custom with these kings, so soon as they\nascended the throne, to begin preparing their final resting-place.The\nexcavation seems to have gone on uninterruptedly year by year, the\npainting and adornment being finished as it progressed, till the hand of\ndeath ended the king\u2019s reign, and simultaneously the works of his tomb.All was then left unfinished; the cartoon of the painter and the rough\nwork of the mason and plasterer were suddenly broken off, as if the hour\nof the king\u2019s demise called them, too, irrevocably from their labours.The tomb thus became an index of the length of a king\u2019s reign as well as\nof his magnificence.Of those in the Valley of the Kings the most\nsplendid is that opened by Belzoni, and now known as that of Meneptah,\nthe builder of the hypostyle hall at Karnac.It descends, in a sloping\ndirection, for about 350 ft.into the mountain, the upper half of it\nbeing tolerably regular in plan and direction; but after progressing as\nfar as the unfinished hall with two pillars, the direction changes, and\nthe works begin again on a lower level, probably because they came in\ncontact with some other tomb, or in consequence of meeting some flaw in\nthe rock.It now terminates in a large and splendid chamber with a coved\nroof, in which stood, when opened by Belzoni, the rifled\nsarcophagus;[58] but a drift-way has been excavated beyond this, as if\nit had been intended to carry the tomb still further had the king\ncontinued to reign.Plan and Section of Tomb of Meneptah at Thebes.Sadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure\nof Coningsby from Hellingsley.When the first pang was over, Edith\nhad found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always\nappreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired\nonly to soften sorrow, and not to create hope.But Lady Wallinger,\nthough she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time\nquitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his\nfriend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in\nfuture, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend\nSir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports\nfrom his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his\nnumerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of\nthe alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any\nlonger to be blind to the great change.That happy and equable gaiety of\nspirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,\nand which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting.She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was\nfitful, unequal in her tone.That temper whose sweetness had been a\ndomestic proverb had become a little uncertain.Not that her affection\nfor her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual\nirritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of\ntenderness that were the creatures of compunction.And often, after some\nhasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the\nfondness of remorse.She pursued her usual avocations, for she had\nreally too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of\ntoo strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and\ndistraction.Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with\nthese; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr.Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved.Edith, his Edith, the pride\nand delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of\nexultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;\nand there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond\nfather, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness.It would\nappear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of\ngratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery.Truly\nhad the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.And yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr.Millbank that he had\nacted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision.The union was impossible; the speedier their\nseparation, therefore, clearly the better.Unfortunate, indeed, had been\nhis absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have\nprevented the catastrophe.Oswald should have hindered all this.Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to\nConingsby.He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from\nthat quarter.Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as\na despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had\nabsolutely acted in an inevitable manner!Edith seemed sad, Oswald\nsullen; all was changed.All the objects for which this clear-headed,\nstrong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed\nto be frustrated.Because a young man had made love to his\ndaughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing\ncircumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that\nthey should pay a visit to their earlier home.Edith assented without\ndifficulty, but without interest.Millbank immediately\nperceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits\nof Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley.There were\nmore objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial.Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from\nConingsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have\nrecognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of\nhis daughter which had so greatly gratified him.About a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.Millbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him.But\nLondon in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father\nalways occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them\nall, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or\ncheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother.Oswald had\nheard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did\nnot anticipate his return to England.His tone was affectionate, but\ndispirited.Lady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.Millbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took\na house and carried Edith back with him to London.Lady Wallinger,\nwho had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a\nnot inconsiderable position in society.She had a fine house in a\nfashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments.The Whigs\nwere under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were\ngratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom\nthey could be courteous without any annoyance.So that Edith, under the\nauspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise\nshe might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and\nexperience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified\nher to shine in.One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their\nfriend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was\nseldom from their side.His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both\non the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,\nbut to express that consideration for Mr.Millbank which the Duke always\nwished to show.It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.Millbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society.He liked the\nHouse of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked\nat committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the\nnight; always dined at Bellamy's when there was a house; and when there\nwas not, liked dining at the Fishmongers' Company, the Russia Company,\ngreat Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities.That was\nhis idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good\ndinner, and good speeches afterwards.Edith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother\nhad heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.A season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,\nperhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together\nover the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each\nother's unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of\nyouth, foreseeing a more felicitous future.She had been nearly a\nfortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as\nConingsby, they had not yet met.It was one of those results which\ncould rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the\nleague against lovers.The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was\ntherefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely\ndoubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord\nBeaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Never, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering\nspirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders\nthe young heart.In vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom\nfor a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over.He was not\nthere; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most\nrequired solace, she learned from Mr.Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,\nwhom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no\nlonger inexplicable.What a return for all her romantic devotion in her\nsad solitude at Hellingsley.Was this the end of their twilight rambles,\nand the sweet pathos of their mutual loves?There seemed to be no truth\nin man, no joy in life!All the feelings that she had so generously\nlavished, all returned upon herself.She could have burst into a passion\nof tears and buried herself in a cloister.Instead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though\ntortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a\nheadache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,\nher escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.As for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the\nunexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which\nshe had received him.To say that her appearance had revived all his\npassionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the\nnature of his feelings.His affection had never for a moment swerved; it\nwas profound and firm.But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought\nbefore him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that\nsubsisted between them.There was the being whom he loved and who loved\nhim; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life\nplaced against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament\nof an unpolluted heart.Coningsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to\nEngland: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit\nfaltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and\nmourning over his chagrined fortunes.Once more in England, once more\nplaced in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased\nconviction the difficulties which surrounded him.The society of Lady\nEveringham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,\nhad been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering\ntoo much from the tension of one idea.But Coningsby had treated the\nmatrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity\nin which he believed it had first half originated.He admired and liked\nLady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even\nhad his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which\nmen of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.After musing and meditating again and again over everything that had\noccurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,\nresolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,\nwho, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.Yet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was\nat breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,\napprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible\non urgent business.Lord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was\nfirst introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of\npapers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his\nobservations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.Thus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.'You see, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, 'that I am much occupied to-day,\nyet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing\nthat it could not be postponed.'He made a sign to Villebecque, and his\nsecretary instantly retired.'I was right in pressing your return to England,' continued Lord\nMonmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending\ncommunication, which he could not in any way anticipate.'These are not\ntimes when young men should be out of sight.You may be astonished, but\nit is a fact.They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.Notwithstanding this and the Queen's name, we can beat them; but the\nrace requires the finest jockeying.Tadpole has\nbeen here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may\nsay an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government\ncount on the seat, though with the new Registration 'tis nearly a tie.If we had a good candidate we could win.He is too\nmuch of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse.We are\nassured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable\nsection who support the present fellow who will not vote against a\nConingsby.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved\nof the suggestion.You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford\nwith my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be\nsuccessful.You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very\ngratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only\nConingsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to\ndo so as early as I could fairly desire.'Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!Vanquished or victorious, equally a catastrophe!The fierce passions,\nthe gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and\nthe ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which\nhe was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best\nin the world, occurred to him with anguish.The countenance of\nEdith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again.He saw her\ncanvassing for her father, and against him.And for what was\nhe to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition?Not even\nfor that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much!Mighty\nambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys!To enter the House of\nCommons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and\nto labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the\nconsolation of being a dupe.What sympathy could there exist between\nConingsby and the 'great Conservative party,' that for ten years in\nan age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only\nintelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very\ngrateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive\nIrish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to\nevince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this\nmoment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in\nopen insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?'inquired\nConingsby after a moment's pause.'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful.It may be next\nmonth; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord\nEskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me.Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once.But whether they dissolve\nnow, or in a month's time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course\nis clear.Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford.You\nmust attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you\nto announce yourself.''Don't you think, sir,' said Coningsby, 'that such an announcement would\nbe rather premature?It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may\nlast a year; perhaps more.''What you say is very true,' said Lord Monmouth; 'no doubt it is very\ntroublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is.But we must take things\nas we find them.You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old\ngentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has\nbeen fostered for our purpose.'Coningsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,\nand then gave something like a sigh.'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,' said Lord\nMonmouth.'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in\nso short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.''You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,' said\nConingsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,\n'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.''I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a\nresponsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,' said Coningsby.How can any one have a more agreeable seat?The only person to\nwhom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in.And I\ndon't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us.You\nare certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when\nI first went in; and I found no difficulty.All you have got to do is to vote with your party.As for speaking, if\nyou have a talent that way, take my advice; don't be in a hurry.Learn\nto know the House; learn the House to know you.If a man be discreet, he\ncannot enter Parliament too soon.''It is not exactly that, sir,' said Coningsby.'Then what is it, my dear Harry?You see to-day I have much to do; yet\nas your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour.I\nthought you would have been very much gratified.''You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,'\nreplied Coningsby.'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood\nby the Conservative party.''I am sorry,' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,\n'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.'exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat,'some woman\nhas got hold of him, and made him a Whig!''No, my dear grandfather,' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a\nsmile, serious as the interview was becoming, 'nothing of the kind, I\nassure you.No person can be more anti-Whig.''I don't know what you are driving at, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, in a\nhard, dry tone.'I wish to be frank, sir,' said Coningsby, 'and am very sensible of your\ngoodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject.What I mean to\nsay is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party\nas a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,\nthan from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal\nto the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real\ncharacter.''Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion.But we must\nmount higher; we must go to '28 for the real mischief.But what is the\nuse of lamenting the past?Peel is the only man; suited to the times and\nall that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can't go\nback.And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of\nthe hands of our own order.It was never thought of in the time of your\ngreat-grandfather, sir.And if a commoner were for a season permitted\nto be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret\ncommittee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.''I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles\nagain,' said Coningsby.'Then what the devil do you want to see?''Political faith,' said Coningsby, 'instead of political infidelity.''Before I support Conservative principles,' continued Coningsby, 'I\nmerely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve.It\nwould not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal\nportion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late\nroyal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot.Is it the Church\nwhich they wish to conserve?What is a threatened Appropriation Clause\nagainst an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary\nLaymen?Well, then, if it\nis neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this\nConservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House\nof Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold?Is it not notorious\nthat the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,\ndeclares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly\nthat used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles\nthat you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is\nto subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial\ntranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?''All this is vastly fine,' said Lord Monmouth; 'but I see no means by\nwhich I can attain my object but by supporting Peel.After all, what is\nthe end of all parties and all politics?I want to\nturn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony\ncalled out of abeyance in your favour.It is impossible that Peel can\nrefuse me.I have already purchased an ample estate with the view\nof entailing it on you and your issue.You will make a considerable\nalliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney.Count on my at once entering into any arrangement\nconducive to your happiness.''My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and\ngenerous.''To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never\ncrossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud?Yes, Harry, it\ngratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success.All I want\nnow is to see you in Parliament.There is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his\ntalents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the\noccasion offers.You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities\nwell; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the\nBed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;\nstick to the Irish Registration Bill, that's a good card; and, above\nall, my dear Harry, don't spare that fellow Millbank.Remember, in\nturning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause\nand our coronet, but you crush my foe.Spare nothing for that object; I\ncount on you, boy.''I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your\ninterest or your honour, sir,' said Coningsby, with an air of great\nembarrassment.'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,' said Lord Monmouth, in a\ntone of some kindness.'And I feel at this moment,' continued Coningsby, 'that there is no\npersonal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.My interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,\nif yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might\ninvolve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well\nendure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous\ntolerance.'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.'I can't follow you, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be\nany sacrifice of conduct on your part.What you mean by sacrifice of\naffections, I don't comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no\nbusiness to have any other than those I uphold.'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,'\nreplied Coningsby; 'I have never intruded them on your ear before;\nbut this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about\nto commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be\nfrank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one\nof those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many\npublic men have cause to deplore.''You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider\nyour opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.''Yes, sir,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'but men going with their\nfamilies like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which\nthe society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform\nBill.'said Lord Monmouth; 'if the Duke had not\nquarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had\nthe Reform Bill.'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,' said Coningsby.'No, no, no,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the Tory party is organised now; they\nwill not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have\ndone the business.''At the best to turn\nout the Whigs.And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then?You\nmay get your ducal coronet, sir.But a duke now is not so great a man\nas a baron was but a century back.We cannot struggle against the\nirresistible stream of circumstances.Power has left our order; this is\nnot an age for factitious aristocracy.As for my grandmother's barony, I\nshould look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the\nact of my political extinction.What we want, sir, is not to fashion\nnew dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles\nwhich may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people.Let\nme see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit\nof our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days\nof faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all\ntenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought\nabout, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,\nand public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in\nParliament an enviable distinction.''I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,'members\nof this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate\nfor the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,\nyou must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a\nprevious intimation of your movement.I\nsent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and\nfind he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at\nthree o'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,\nlike a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a\nglance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to\nsacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical\npuerilities.'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent\nany further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,\nto have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the\ncourt-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled\nhim for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his\nambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed\naffections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source\nof solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at\ntimes the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is\npast; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,\ndespair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:\nand that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of\nbaffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate\nhimself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something\nabout his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent\nyouth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,\nConingsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been\na callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,\nthat at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby\nforget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no\npossibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,\n'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of\nfriendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded\neven more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released\nhim from the mesh in which he was involved.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.And once Coningsby had\nturned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But\nsurely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which\nsubsisted between himself and Edith.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to\nher.He looked in for a moment at a club\nto take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction.A few men were\nstanding in a bow window.Cassilis say,\n\n'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?''I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion.'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr.The father is a cotton\nlord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.'He is in Parliament, is not he?'''Gad, I believe he is", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Cassilis; 'I never know who is in\nParliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the\nHouse of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman.'It was all\ndone a year ago at Rome or Paris.''They say she refused him then,' said Mr.'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his\nfriend.'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart.In spite\nof every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his\naspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously\nto himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was\nfatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another's.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound\nand desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection\nof the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into\none bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his\nhorse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and\nundisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the\ncontemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his\nmission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,\nprosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;\nmight not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his\nendurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with\nall his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his\ndaughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her\nflush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,\nif indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the\nhumbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever\ncould have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of\nhis companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of\nhis fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were\nall these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of\nlife was he to blunder?'Tis the first step that leads to all, and\nhis was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his\ngrandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his\nreturn.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then\nso highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on\nwere on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank\nand power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could\nmistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,\nperhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the\nplanets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation\nof his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and\ntranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like\nseraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of\nthe pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of\nhumanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring\npurpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition\nto him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his\nknowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he\npossessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world\nwould recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the\nprinciples of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation\nwould respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a\nprofound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct\nwhich would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the\nconscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his\nlife, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame\nthat was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,\non his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed\nall that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all\nthe pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already\nannounced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to\nbecome a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as\nthe master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.\n\n\nLady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which\nhad been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he\nthen believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber\nsatin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from\nhis brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines\nin dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is\ncommonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid\npalaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion\nof the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet\ncarpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and\nFlora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to\nher as she was employed with some light work.''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment\nwhich distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression\nwas uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More\nthan once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,\ncollecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,\nand more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the\nmatter?''My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;\nbut my Lord is very angry with Mr.'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.'My\nLord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter\nthe house again.'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not\ndo what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know\nexactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my\nfather is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down\nthe room.Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is\nstupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about\nthe quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;\nthen she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one\nof the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,\nboth waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to\ntransact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without\nhis interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,\nconfided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,\nhis expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could\ncreate no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,\nthere is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which\neverybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being\nmixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine\nmanagement, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and\nthe airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in\nlife had ever been, to do the dirty work.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,\nyou could not term it composing, an article, a'very slashing article,'\nwhich was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the\naristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His\nparallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland\nHill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full\nof passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew\ntears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in\noffice with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against\nthat spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him\nwith information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could\nhave furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress\nof democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on\nAldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good\nhearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of\nthe populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and\nmagnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the\nCrillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The\ntruth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,\nby an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the\nmaintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the\nFrench revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he\nwailed over 'la guerre aux chateaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over\nNottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to\nquarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his\ngrandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,\nand an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing\nto prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the\nMarquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the\ncourse of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate\ndetails of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was\nhighly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their\nmisunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that\nseat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,\nand over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate\nsolicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and\ngave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect\nupon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as\nhe received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,\nplayed over his features.'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth.'He is, he\nhas ever been, in the way of both of us.''He is in my power,' said Rigby.'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought\nHellingsley.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the\nyounger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of\nitself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.''And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,'\nsaid Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,\nsince his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in\nthe same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this\nboy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,\nhave apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never\ndoubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit\nis plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is\nno reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what\nwe want, and more securely if we work in company.''I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'Rid\nme of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done.If once the notion\ngets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for\nDarlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia.'Be sure there is no time to\nlose.'I know not: there are so many things.''To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be\nintroduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love\nfor the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,\ndrinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you\nwill omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash\nhim to madness!Go,\ngo, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the\nmorning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit\nwhen you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_'\n\nLady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced\nover the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too\ninteresting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years\nsince her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was\nto lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with\na presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on\nthis day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to\nmeditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same\ntime dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the\ngossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's\ncharacter or information, based on the haphazard observations of the\nfloating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her\ninfluence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But\nsatisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of\nher position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have\nfound it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;\nand that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their\npassions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are\nrather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not\nsystematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is\nnot her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates\nthe respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent\nfrom the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that\nhis life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had\nmade a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in\ncase of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all\nhope in that respect was over.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord\nMonmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to\nwhich his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had\nalarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house\nof Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and\nperhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding\nthe limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start\ncontemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be\nconvinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately\nbe devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against\nConingsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been\nconsiderably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time\nthere was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled\nher with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel\nassured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not\nbe a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not\nbe transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this\nendeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish\nall her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was\ndefending his own position and advancing his own interests.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and\nmore than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book\nwhich more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless\nrather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability\nfor the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,\nshe could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the\ncircumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time\nstole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting\non her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found\nthe occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from\napprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,\nhad avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination\nfor the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a\nstate of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby\nwere with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that\ngentleman appeared.'Now sit down and\ntell me what has passed.'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet\nperplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little\ndistance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady\nMonmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression\nwith regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?''His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious\nexpression of features.As his Lordship\nvery justly observed, \"It is impossible to say what is going on under my\nown roof, or to what I can trust.\"''But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire\nconfidence,' said Mr.Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his\ndifficulties.''The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the\nestablishment generally,' said Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.Rigby, 'will allow the connection\nthat at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,\nnow that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to\nterminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.''But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his\nestablishment generally?''Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with\ngreat impatience.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.''Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might\nfind some of the German Baths agreeable.''Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German\nbathing-place!''Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?''He does not want to go to them!'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and\nlooking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if\nmalignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed\nhimself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were\nto pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the\n_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you\nthere, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment\ntake the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately\nreach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.''I would never have consented to\ninterfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.''I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural\npallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr.'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.''His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'And\nhe really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr.Rigby, 'your\nLadyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly\nbefore your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:\nyou know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has\nleft peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has\nempowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way\nto consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,\nshould be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;\nthat your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which\nshall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find\nit convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr.Rigby, with some\nhesitation.'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your\nrights.'I speak as the friend of the family, the\ntrustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's\nexecutor,' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its\nusual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he\nremembered the good things which he enumerated.Your\nmaster has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the\nday that he assailed me.''I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr.Rigby,\n'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An\noffice, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some\nconsiderations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion\nthat it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we\nhave hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said\nLucretia.'Now, now, you are unkind.I am\ninterfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled\nit without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my\ninterposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances\nwill assume altogether a new colour.''I beg that you will quit the house, sir.''I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were\nit in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should\ntake up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship's sake, I wish\neverything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,\nfriendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the\npreparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all\nthose that are not at the bankers'.The arrangement about your jointure,\nyour letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;\nonly too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way\ncontributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may\nnaturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,\nwill wear off.''I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the\nsame advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he\nadded slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.''Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard\nsome treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I\nhave them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as\na foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,\nhaving the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,\nand having known you so many years.''Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth.'Send me my\nservant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you\nmention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot\nhelp feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the\nhouse, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with\nhis grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town\nfor the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day\nat Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details\nof their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had\ncertainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,\ninformed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could\nnot tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was\nabout to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time\nbeen fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as\nConingsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All\nthis intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted\nwith the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the\nwhole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of\nthe occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of\nwas, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the\nexception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from\nLord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was\nalso something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating\nto young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but\npleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to\nhis grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced\nin life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and\nfacility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was\nalways pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a\nsentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on\nthe whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,\nthese were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more\nprecious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that\nhis grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He\nwas informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a\ndrawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he\nsoon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit\nto his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval\nthat must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his\ngrandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest\nspirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious\npractical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And\nwell it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,\nand no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and\nno herald to announce his grandfather's advent.The ladies and Coningsby\nhad exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the\nfurniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and\nClotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to\nErmengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage\nwas in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth\nhoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he\ninformed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry\nhe was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and\ntell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with\nyou.'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;\nand as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong\nimpression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left\nfor his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment\nthat his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely\nin his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at\nthe bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to\nsee him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of\nsomething like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,\nand an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do\nanything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable\nto Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is\noften followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth\nthe separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his\nmeditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not\nwish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in\nsome degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the\nconventional interests of what is called 'the World.'He wanted to hear\nnothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our\ncontracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such\nundue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons\nwhose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of\nexistence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources\nof enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of\nRespectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is\ntermed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the\ncommunity as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient\ncircumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from\ngrandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be\nreminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in\nhis Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who\nopened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who\nwas so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;\nsaw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices\nof thrilling joyousness,--\n\n'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of\nelocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his\ncharms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really\nhad not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed\nto the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,\nhowever, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of\nexplanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;\nand to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he\nsaid,\n\n'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the\nbottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite\nof all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification\nand resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually\nmade on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a\nmonth had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to\nreceive an invitation again to dine with his", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling\nas their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of\nVillebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna\nof celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist\nnobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,\ncould tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,\nwhich had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom\nLord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the\nelixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the\nbottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and\nat one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances\nstill more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to\nbreathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described\nas meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never\nto encounter each other's glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had\nbecome an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were\ndiscussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,\nmany sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord\nBeaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry\nwhich might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed\nhis life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and\nwas almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally\naccompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,\nindeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less\ninseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured\nmarriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not\nyet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of\nits ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her\nacquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her\nbrother should marry and be happy.'But Percy is often in love,' she\nwould add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may\ncompromise his heroic character.However,' she added, 'I really believe\nthat will be a match.'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby\npassed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding\non one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell\nthat impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and\nthe circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently\nmentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his\ndesolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,\napparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the\ndarkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,\nthough never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed\nto be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject\nfruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed\nin the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and\ncherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early\nyouth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some\nmoors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town\nfor Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,\nwho in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,\nhad surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague\nmention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast\ngiven, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks\nof the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the\nromances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls\ncolossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the\nair with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on\nturf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering\nshades of winding walks.'My fete was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.'I am glad it is connected with an incident.'You are mystical as well as prophetic.Tell me what we are to\ncelebrate.''Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace\nLyle.''You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps\nbecause I was thinking too much of some one else.''It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when\nEustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was\nconvinced.''At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling\nface, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished\nto have been more.'Happiness,' he\nadded, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.''tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,\nwe must all determine to be happy.''Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he\nmoved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse\nin their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the\nintelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter\nto marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara\nIsabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great\nregard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the\ninfluential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case\nConingsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might\ncounsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable\nact.Ormsby, who seemed\noccupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little\neasterly wind with all this fine appearance.''I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale.'Do you know, I do\nnot half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that\nvilla of his.'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry\nit broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.''Lord Monmouth lived with his\nfirst wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at\nleast nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,\nfor he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at\nLucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted\nto bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being\nhis intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his\ntrustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.''You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and\nthen there never would have been a separation.'About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,\nmet, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy\nFlouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby\nwas about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped\nand would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,\nbut yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.Lady\nWallinger followed with Coningsby.'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'\nsaid Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it\nseems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every\none must approve.''Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to\nobserve obvious circumstances.'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to\nLady Theresa?''Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively\ngoing to be married to her.''I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such\nrapidity, Lady Wallinger.''You remember our meeting you on the\nstairs at ---- House, Mr.'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady\nTheresa.''Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?''I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord\nBeaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given\nhim no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she\nbelieved; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I\nam to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it\ncruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.''You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most\namiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that\nEdith is not going to be married?'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady\nWallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point\nto her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply\ninteresting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with\nbecoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of\nexaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby\nwalked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady\nWallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end\nof the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the\nmultitude that thronged the lawn.'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,\nand saw Edith on his arm.Lord\nBeaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before\nBuckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing\nthat no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was\nimpelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down\neverybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Two dozen mouths commenced to show\n    Their teeth in white and even row;\n    Two dozen voices cried with speed,\n    \"The plan is good we're all agreed.\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    And in a trice four dozen feet\n    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race\n    The Brownies soon secured a place\n    That answered well in every way\n    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,\n    By which to stoop or kneel around,\n    And strive to bring the pennies out\n    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,\n    Where some would still the coin pursue,\n    And mouth about now here and there\n    Without a pause or breath of air\n    Until in pride, with joyful cries,\n    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,\n    And with a hasty snap of teeth\n    The whirling apple thought to claim\n    And shun the while the candle's flame,--\n    But found that with such pleasure goes\n    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    More named the oats as people do\n    To try which hearts are false, which true,\n    And on the griddle placed the pair\n    To let them part or smoulder there;\n    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,\n    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate\n    Or fortune in a dish or plate,\n    Learn whether they would ever wed,\n    Or lead a single life instead;\n    Or if their mate would be a blessing,\n    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Then others in the open air,\n    Of fun and frolic had their share;\n    Played \"hide and seek,\" and \"blindman's buff,\"\n    And \"tag\" o'er places smooth or rough,\n    And \"snap the whip\" and \"trip the toe,\"\n    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,\n    They jumped around and dodged and raced,\n    And tumbled headlong to the ground\n    When feet some hard obstruction found;\n    At times across the level mead,\n    Some proved their special claims to speed,\n    And as reward of merit wore\n    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will\n    When joys do every moment fill;\n    The moon grew weak and said good-night,\n    And turned her pallid face from sight;\n    Then weakening stars began to fail,\n    But still the Brownies kept the vale;\n    Full many a time had hours retired\n    Much faster than the band desired,\n    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay\n    Aside, because of coming day,\n      But never yet with greater pain\n        Did they behold the crimson stain\n          That morning spread along the sky,\n            And told them they must homeward fly\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]\n\n    The Brownies through a village bound,\n    Paused in their run to look around,\n    And wondered why the central square\n    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: \"Without delay we'll go\n    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest\n    So straight and high above the rest,\n    We soon can choose a flag-pole there\n    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend\n    To trim it off from end to end,\n    To peel it smooth and paint it white,\n    And hoist it in the square to-night.\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Then to the woods the Brownies ran\n    At once to carry out their plan;\n    While some ran here and there with speed\n    For implements to serve their need,\n    Some rambled through the forest free\n    To find the proper kind of tree,\n    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood\n    To learn if it was sound and good,\n                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,\n                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,\n                                   To work the active Brownies fell;\n      And soon with sticks beneath their load,\n      The band in grand procession strode;\n        It gave them quite enough to do\n        To safely put the project through,\n        But when they reached the square, at last,\n        Some ropes around the pole were passed\n        And from the tops of maples tall\n        A crowd began to pull and haul,\n        While others gathered at the base\n        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    For Brownies seldom idle stand\n    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round\n    They come from secret haunts profound,\n    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,\n    They clamber over fence and wall;\n    And soon on objects here and there\n    That hold positions high in air,\n    And most attract the human eye,\n    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire\n    They climb the tall cathedral spire;\n    When all the town is still below,\n    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,\n    By light of moon, and stars alone,\n    They dust the marble and the stone,\n          And with their brushes, small and great,\n          They paint and gild the dial-plate;\n          And bring the figures plain in sight\n          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know\n          While through the heavy works they go,\n          Where slowly turning wheels at last\n          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all\n          The hardships that may them befall,\n          Still persevere in every case\n          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly\n          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]\n\n    One night the Brownies stood beside\n    A long canal, whose silent tide\n    Connected seaboard cities great\n    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,\n    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;\n    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,\n    No mules were tugging on the shore;\n    All work on land and water too\n    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: \"We see, without a doubt,\n    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,\n    For even rates, or shorter day,\n    Has caused the boats to loiter here\n    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round\n    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,\n    Upon some kitchen-stove or range\n    To spread an odor rich and strange;\n    Those squashes, too, should not be lost\n    By long exposure to the frost,\n    When they would prove so great a prize\n    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,\n    From some fine orchard picked with care,\n                    Should not to rot and ruin go,\n                    Though work is hard or wages low,\n                    When thousands would be glad to stew\n                    The smallest apples there in view.\"[Illustration]\n\n    Another said: \"We lack the might\n    To set the wrongs of labor right,\n    But by the power within us placed\n    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied\n    That boats upon their way may glide.\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Then some ran here and there with speed\n    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about\n    The grassy banks, were fitted out\n                With straps and ropes without delay\n                To start the boats upon their way;\n                And next some straying goats were found,\n                Where in a yard they nibbled round\n                Destroying plants of rarest kind\n                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,\n    They found themselves in harness fast;\n    Then into active service pressed\n    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]\n\n    On deck some Brownies took their stand\n    To man the helm, or give command,\n    And oversee the work; while more\n    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along\n            And catch on snags or branches long,\n                    And cause delays they ill could bear,\n                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]\n\n            With accidents they often met,\n            And some were bruised and more were wet;\n            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;\n            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,\n            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,\n            When enterprises bold and new\n    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt\n    The work would still be carried out,\n    For extra strength would then be found\n    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout\n    They stood and stared or ran about\n    Till in the water, heels o'er head,\n    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    A few could swim, and held their own;\n    But more went downward like a stone\n    Until, without the plummet's aid,\n            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings\n            That fright at such a moment brings,\n    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,\n    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team\n    Would pass along with sign and scream,\n    And those on land would know by this\n    That something startling was amiss;\n    And those on board could plainly see\n    Unless assistance there could be,\n    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,\n    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]\n\n    By chance a net was to be had,\n    That boatmen used for catching shad--\n    A gill-net of the strongest kind,\n    For heavy catches well designed;\n    Few shad against its meshes ran\n    But left their bones on some one's pan,\n    This bulky thing the active crew\n    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,\n    While others in its folds were bound,\n    Until like fish in great dismay\n    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,\n    And quickly from the muddy bed\n    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled\n    The dripping net was upward hauled,\n    With all the Brownies clinging fast,\n    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]\n\n                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road\n                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed\n    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,\n    With many strange mishaps the while,\n    But working bravely through the night\n    Until the city came in sight.Said one: \"Now, thanks to bearded goats\n    And patient mules, the heavy boats\n    For hours have glided on their way,\n    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show\n    His colors to the world below,\n    And other birds than those of night\n    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;\n    The ebbing tide must do the rest;\n    Now drifting downward to their pier\n    Let barges unassisted steer,\n    While we make haste, with nimble feet,\n    To find in woods a safe retreat.\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee\n    A slumbering city by the sea.\"In yonder town,\" the leader cried,\n    \"I hear the artist does reside\n    Who pictures out, with patient hand,\n    The doings of the Brownie band.\"\"I'd freely give,\" another said,\n    \"The cap that now protects my head,\n    To find the room, where, day by day,\n    He shows us at our work or play.\"A third replied: \"Your cap retain\n    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,\n    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more\n    And soon we'll reach the office door.\"[Illustration]\n\n    Then through the park, around the square,\n    And down the broadest thoroughfare,\n    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,\n    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]\n\n        They paused awhile to view the sight,\n        To speak about its age and height,\n        And read the signs, so long and wide,\n        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,\n                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told\n                Their funny actions, free and bold,\n                Was honored by a friendly call\n                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Then what a gallery they found,\n                As here and there they moved around--\n                For now they gaze upon a scene\n                That showed them sporting on the green;\n                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed\n                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, \"Upon this desk, no doubt,\n                Where now we cluster round about,\n                Our doings have been plainly told\n    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,\n    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,\n    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold\n            That darksome liquid may unfold!\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            A telephone gave great delight\n            To those who tried it half the night,\n            Some asking after fresh supplies;\n    Or if their stocks were on the rise;\n    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;\n    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro\n    With \"Who are you?\"And all the repetitions known\n    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    \"Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,\"\n    Said one, \"that's written every line;\n    Indebted to this pen are we\n    For all our fame and history.\"\"See here,\" another said, \"I've found\n    The pointed pencil, long and round,\n    That pictures all our looks so wise,\n            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;\n            'Tis well it draws us all aright,\n            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name\n            In every region known to fame,\n            To know that children lisp our praise,\n            And on our faces love to gaze.\"Old pistols that brave service knew\n    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view\n    In mimic duels on the floor,\n    And snapped at paces three or four;\n    While from the foils the Brownies plied,\n    The sparks in showers scattered wide,\n    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,\n    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash\n    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,\n    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,\n    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]\n\n    They found old shields that bore the dint\n    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,\n    And held them up in proper pose;\n    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]\n\n    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,\n    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,\n    Until the laugh of comrades nigh\n    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,\n    Which every one could recognize:\n    The features, garments, and the style,\n    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,\n    And showed their skill was something rare;\n    While others talked and rummaged through\n    The desk to find the stories new,\n    That told about some late affair,\n    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power\n    To hasten every passing hour,\n    And bring too soon the morning chime,\n    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,\n    The startling hint of morning fell,\n    And Brownies realized the need\n    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street\n    They made their way with nimble feet,\n    And ere the sun could show his face,\n    The band had reached a hiding-place.Programme\n\nTHIS EVENING, THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, _At_ 8.30 _punctually_,\n\nDANDY DICK.AN ORIGINAL FARCE, IN THREE ACTS,\n\nBY\n\nA.

W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian\nsuccesses, and Mr.Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman._The morning-room in the Deanery of St.Marvells, with a large arched\nopening leading to the library on the right, and a deeply-recessed\nwindow opening out to the garden on the left.It is a bright spring\nmorning, and an air of comfort and serenity pervades the place._\n\n_SALOME, a tall, handsome, dark girl, of about three-and-twenty, is\nsitting with her elbows resting on her knees, staring wildly into\nvacancy.SHEBA, a fair little girl of about seventeen, wearing short\npetticoats, shares her despondency, and lies prostrate upon the\nsettee._\n\nSALOME.[_Sitting upright._] Oh, my gracious goodness, goodness gracious me![_They both walk about excitedly._\n\nSALOME.There's only one terrible word for it--it's a fix!How did _we_ get led into it?It was Major Tarver's proposal, and I believe, Salome, that it is to\n_you_ Major Tarver is paying attention.The Fancy Dress Masked Ball at Durnstone is promoted by the Officers\nof the Hussars.I believe that the young gentleman you have impressed\ncalls himself an officer, though he is merely a lieutenant.Darbey is _certainly_ an officer--a small\nofficer.How dare you gird at me, Salome?When to-night we appear at the Durnstone Athenaeum,\nunknown to dear Papa, on the arms of Major Tarver and Mr.Darbey, I\nconsider that we shall be equally wicked.We're only _going_ to be wrong; that's a\nvery different matter.Besides, there's this to remember--we're inexperienced\ngirls and have only dear Papa.But oh, now that the Ball is to-night,\nI repent, Sheba, I repent!I sha'n't do that till to-morrow.But oh, how I _shall_ repent\nto-morrow![_Taking an envelope from her pocket, and almost crying._] You'd\nrepent now if you had seen the account for the fancy dresses.Yes, the Major enclosed it to me this morning.You know, Sheba, Major\nTarver promised to get the dresses made in London, so I gave him our\nbrown paper patterns to send to the _costumier._\n\nSHEBA.[_Shocked._] Oh, Salome, do you think he quizzed them?<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.No; I sealed them up and marked outside \"To be opened only by a lady.\"I hate the plan of myself in brown paper.Well, of course Major Tarver begged to be allowed to pay for the\ndresses, and I said I couldn't dream of permitting it, and then he\nsaid he should be most unhappy if he didn't, and, just as I thought he\nwas going to have his own way, [_bursting into tears_] he cheered up\nand said he'd yield to a lady.[_Taking a large account from the\nenvelope._] And oh![_Reading._] \"Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, _Costumier_ to the Queen, Bow\nStreet.One gown--period French Revolution, 1798--Fifteen guineas!\"[_Sinking on her knees, clutching the table._] Oh!\"Trimmings, linings, buttons, frillings--Seven guineas!\"[_Putting her fingers into her ears._] Now for mine, oooh![_Reading._] \"One skirt and bodice--flower girl--period uncertain--Ten\nguineas.\"\"Trimmings, linings, buttons, frillings--Five guineas!Ladies' own brown paper\npatterns mislaid.[_They throw themselves into each other's arms._\n\nSALOME.If we were only a few years older I should suggest that we wrote nice\nnotes to Papa and committed suicide.Brought up as we have been, that's out of the question!Then let us be brave women and wear the dresses!Of course we'll do that, but--the bill!We must get dear Papa in a good humor and coax him to make us a\npresent of money.He knows we haven't been charitable in the town for\never so long.He hasn't paid our proper dressmaker's bill yet, and\nI'm sure he's pressed for money.But we can't help that when _we're_ pressed for money--poor dear Papa!Suppose poor Papa refuses to give us a present?Then we must play the piano when he's at work on his Concord", "question": "Where is John?

artificial attitude._] Where shall we\nbe--here?[_Running to the piano._] All right; you be admiring my voice!Here they are, and we're doing nothing!Let's run away and then come in unconsciously.BLORE shows in MAJOR TARVER and\nMR.DARBEY, who are both in regimentals.MAJOR TARVER is a\nmiddle-aged, tall, angular officer, with a thin face, yellow\ncomplexion, and red eyes.He is alternately in a state of great\nexcitement and depression.DARBEY is a mere boy, but with a\npompous, patronizing manner._\n\nDARBEY.The Dean's out of the way, eh!Never mind--perhaps Miss Jedd is at home?It would be discourteous to run away without asking Miss Jedd after\nher father.[_Throwing himself on the settee._] Deuced bad form![_SALOME and SHEBA walk in together.SALOME has her arm round her\nsister's waist and looks up to her with a sweet, trusting smile.They\nstart in confusion on seeing TARVER and DARBEY._\n\nSALOME.[_Taking SALOME'S hand eagerly._] My dear Miss Jedd![_Rising and putting a glass to his eye._] Hah yah![_With her hand on her heart._] You quite startled us.[_In an agony of contrition._] Oh, did we?We never dreamt of finding two visitors for Papa.Why, you told me to show the gentlemen hin, Miss Sheba![_The two girls start guiltily and glare at BLORE._\n\nSALOME.[_To himself._] Let 'em 'ang that on the 'atstand!DARBEY and SHEBA stroll together into the Library._\n\nTARVER.[_To SALOME._] We thought we'd ride over directly after parade to make\nthe final arrangements for tonight.Yes, they came yesterday in a hamper labeled \"Miss Jedd, Secretary,\nCast-off Clothing Distribution League.\"That was my idea--came to me in the middle of the night.Dear Major Tarver, surely this terrible strain on your nerves is very,\nvery bad for you with your--your----\n\nTARVER.My liver--say the word, Miss Jedd.[_Drooping her head._] Oh, Major Tarver!Of course I'm excited now, and you see me\nat my best, but the alternating fits of hopeless despondency are\nshocking to witness and to endure!Oh, Miss Jedd, my forgetfulness has brought me--one of\nmy--terrible attacks--of depression![_She leads him to a chair into which he sinks in a ghastly state.DARBEY strolls in from the Library with SHEBA._\n\nDARBEY.[_To SHEBA._] Your remarks about the army are extremely complimentary.We fellows are not a bad sort, take\nus all round.There's a grand future before you, isn't there?Well, I suppose there is if I go on as I'm going now.[_To SALOME._] Thanks, the attack has passed.Now about to-night; at\nwhat time is the house entirely quiet?Poor dear Papa goes round with Blore at half-past nine--after that all\nis rest and peacefulness.Then if we're here with the closed carriage at ten--![_They go together into the library._\n\nDARBEY.[_To SHEBA._] Some of us army men can slave too.Tarver's queer livah\nhas thrown all the arrangements for the Fancy Ball on my shoulders.[_SALOME and TARVER re-enter._] Look at him--that's when he's enjoying\nlife![_Laughing convulsively._] Ha!But suppose dear Papa should hear us crunching down the gravel path!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.[_He sinks on to the settee with a vacant stare, his arms hanging\nhelplessly._\n\nDARBEY.[_To SHEBA._] There--now his career is a burden to him!Would you like a glass of water, Major Tarver?[_Taking SALOME'S hand._] Thank you, dear Miss Jedd, with the least\nsuggestion of cayenne pepper in it.[_Looking out at window._] Oh, Salome![_They all collect themselves in a fluster.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.The two girls go to meet\ntheir father, who enters at the window with his head bowed and his\nhands behind his back, in deep thought.THE DEAN is a portly man of\nabout fifty, with a dignified

is.[_SHEBA takes the gold-rimmed pince-nez which hangs upon THE DEAN'S\nwaistcoat and places it before his eyes._\n\nTHE DEAN.[_With his girls still embracing him he\nextends a hand to each of the

with us to-night at six o'clock!Let me see--Tuesday night is----\n\nSALOME.Thank you, toy-child--custards, cold.[_Looking to SALOME._] Well, I--ah--[_SALOME nods her head to him\nviolently._] That is, certainly, Dean, certainly.Delighted, my dear Dean--delighted![_THE DEAN gives DARBEY a severe look, and with an important cough\nwalks into the Library.The men and the girls speak in

Durnstone?[_THE DEAN sits at his desk in the Library._\n\nDARBEY.Of course; when we're turned out we can hang about in the lane till\nyou're ready.Yes, but when are _we_ to make our preparations?It'll take me a long\ntime to look like Charles the First!We can drive about Durnstone while you dress.[_To TARVER, admiringly._] Charles the First!That was my idea--Charles the Martyr, you know.Tarver's a martyr to\nhis liver--see?[_They are all in a state of great excitement when THE DEAN re-enters,\nwith an anxious look, carrying a bundle of papers._\n\nSALOME.[_They rush to various seats, all in

the\nLibrary._\n\nTHE DEAN.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.[_Looking up._] Don't go, children![_He rises, the girls rush to him, and laughing with joy they turn him\nlike a top, dancing round him._\n\n[_Panting._] Stop, children![_Pinching his chin._] He always is!Papsey will listen to our little wants!SALOME sits on the ground embracing his\nlegs, SHEBA lies on the top of the

deuced flattered at that.He knows he's in the Deanery too.Did you see him cast\nup his eyes and lay his ears back when I led him in?Oh, George, George, it's such a pity about his tail!You watch his head to-morrow--that'll come in\nfirst.[_HATCHAM, a groom, looks in at the window._\n\nHATCHAM.I jest run round to tell you that Dandy is a feedin' as steady as a\nbaby with a bottle.And I've got hold of the constable 'ere, Mr.Topping--he's going to sit up with me, for company's sake.[_Coming forward mysteriously._] Why, bless you and\nthe lady, sir--supposin' the fire at the \"Swan\" warn't no accident!Supposin' it were inciderism--and supposin' our 'orse was the hobject.That's why I ain't goin' to watch single-handed.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA pace up and down excitedly._\n\nHATCHAM.There's only one mortal fear I've got about our Dandy.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.He 'asn't found out about 'is tail yet, sir, and when he does it'll\nfret him, as sure as my name's Bob Hatcham.Keep the stable pitch dark--he mayn't notice it.Not to-night, sir, but he's a proud 'orse and what'll he think of\n'isself on the 'ill to-morrow?You and me and the lady, sir--it 'ud be\ndifferent with us, but how's our Dandy to hide his bereavement?[_HATCHAM goes out of the window with SIR TRISTRAM as THE DEAN enters,\nfollowed by BLORE, who carries a lighted lantern._\n\nTHE DEAN.[_Looking reproachfully at GEORGIANA._] You have returned, Georgiana?You can sleep to-night with the happy consciousness of having\nsheltered the outcast.The poor children, exhausted with the alarm, beg\nme to say good-night for them.Yes, sir; but I hear they've just sent into Durnstone hasking for the\nMilitary to watch the ruins in case of another houtbreak.It'll stop\nthe wicked Ball at the Hathanaeum, it will![_Drawing the window curtains._\n\nSIR TRISTRAM.[_Having re-entered._] I suppose you want to see the last of me, Jedd.Where shall we stow the dear old chap, Gus, my\nboy?Where shall we stow the dear old chap!We don't want to pitch you out of your loft if we can help\nit, Gus.No, no--we won't do that.But there's Sheba's little cot still\nstanding in the old nursery.Just the thing for me--the old nursery.Toys to play with if you wake early.[_Looking round._] Is there anyone else before we lock up?[_BLORE has fastened the window and drawn the curtain._\n\nGEORGIANA.Put Sir Tristram to bed carefully in the nursery, Blore.[_Grasping THE DEAN'S hand._] Good-night, old boy.I'm too done for a\nhand of Piquet to-night.[_Slapping him on the back._] I'll teach you during my stay at the\nDeanery.[_Helplessly to himself._] Then he's staying with me!Heaven bless the little innocent in his cot.[_SIR TRISTRAM goes out with BLORE._\n\nGEORGIANA.We\nsmoke all over the Deanery.Does _she?_\n\nGEORGIANA.[_Closes the door, humming a tune merrily._] Tra la, tra la![_She stops, looking at THE DEAN,\nwho is muttering to himself._] Gus, I don't like your looks, I shall\nlet the Vet see you in the morning.[_THE DEAN shakes his head mournfully, and sinks on the settee._\n\nGEORGIANA.There _are_ bills, which, at a more convenient time, it will be my\ngrateful duty to discharge.Stumped--out of coin--run low.Very little would settle the bills--but--but----\n\nGEORGIANA.Why, Gus, you haven't got that thousand.There is a very large number of estimable worthy men who do not\npossess a thousand pounds.With that number I have the mournful\npleasure of enrolling myself.Unless the restoration is immediately commenced the spire will\ncertainly crumble.Then it's a match between you and the spire which parts first.Gus,\nwill you let your little sister lend you a hand?No, no--not out of my own pocket.[_She takes his arm and\nwhispers in his ear._] Can you squeeze a pair of ponies?Very well then--clap it on to Dandy Dick!He's a certainty--if those two buckets of water haven't put him off\nit!He's a moral--if he doesn't think of his tail coming down the\nhill.Keep it dark, Gus--don't\nbreathe a word to any of your Canons or Archdeacons, or they'll rush\nat it and shorten the price for us.Go in, Gus, my boy--take your poor\nwidowed sister's tip and sleep as peacefully as a blessed baby![_She presses him warmly to her and kisses him._\n\nTHE DEAN.[_Extricating himself._] Oh!In the morning I will endeavor to frame some verbal expression of the\nhorror with which I regard your proposal.For the present, you are my\nparents' child and I trust your bed is well aired.I've done all I can for the Spire.If you're wiser in the morning just send Blore on to the course and\nhe'll put the money on for you.My poor devoted old servant would be lost on a race-course.He was quite at home in Tattersall's Ring when I was at St.I recognized the veteran sportsman the moment I came into the\nDeanery._BLORE enters with his lantern._\n\nGEORGIANA.Investing the savings of your cook and housemaid, of course.You don't\nthink your servants are as narrow as you are!I beg your pardon, sir, shall I go the rounds, sir?[_THE DEAN gives Blore a fierce look, but BLORE beams sweetly._\n\nGEORGIANA.And pack a hamper with a cold chicken, some\nFrench rolls, and two bottles of Heidsieck--label it \"George Tidd,\"\nand send it on to the Hill.THE DEAN sinks into a chair and clasps his forehead._\n\nBLORE.A dear, 'igh-sperited lady.[_Leaning over THE DEAN._] Aren't you\nwell, sir?THE DEAN\n\nLock up; I'll speak to you in the morning.[_BLORE goes into the Library, turns out the lamp there, and\ndisappears._\n\nWhat dreadful wave threatens to engulf the Deanery?What has come to\nus in a few fatal hours?A horse of sporting tendencies contaminating\nmy stables, his equally vicious owner nestling in the nursery, and my\nown widowed sister, in all probability, smoking a cigarette at her\nbedroom window with her feet on the window-ledge![_He peers through the window curtains._] I thought I\nheard footsteps in the garden.I can see nothing--only the old spire\nstanding out against the threatening sky.[_Leaving the window\nshudderingly._] The Spire!My principal\ncreditor, the most conspicuous object in the city!_BLORE re-enters with his lantern, carrying some bank-notes in his\nhand._\n\nBLORE.[_Laying the notes on the table._] I found these, sir, on your\ndressing-table--they're bank-notes, sir.I placed them there to be sent to the\nBank to-morrow.[_Counting the notes._] Ten--ten--twenty--five--five,\nfifty.The very sum Georgiana urged me to--oh![_To\nBLORE, waving him away._] Leave me--go to bed--go to bed--go to bed![_BLORE is going._] Blore!What made you tempt me with these at such a moment?The window was hopen, and I feared they might blow\naway.[_Catching him by the coat collar._] Man, what were you doing at St.[_With a cry, falling on his knees._] Oh, sir!I knew that\n'igh-sperited lady would bring grief and sorrow to the peaceful, 'appy\nDeanery!Oh, sir, I _'ave_ done a little on my hown account from time\nto time on the 'ill, halso hon commission for the kitchen!Oh, sir, you are a old gentleman--turn a charitable 'art to the Races!It's a wicious institution what spends more ready money in St.Marvells than us good people do in a year.Oh, Edward Blore, Edward Blore, what weak\ncreatures we are!We are, sir--we are--'specially when we've got a tip, sir.Think of\nthe temptation of a tip,

recoils in horror._] Oh![_Sinks into a chair with a groan._\n\nBLORE.[_In a whisper._] Lor', who'd 'ave thought the Dean was such a ardent\nsportsman at 'art?He dursn't give me my notice after this.[_To THE\nDEAN._] Of course it's understood, sir, that we keep our little\nweaknesses dark.Houtwardly, sir, we remain respectable, and, I 'ope,\nrespected.[_Putting the notes into his pocket._] I

is\nshattered![_Turning to THE DEAN._] Good-night, sir.May your dreams\nbe calm and 'appy, and may you have a good run for your money![_BLORE goes out--THE DEAN gradually recovers his self-possession._\n\nTHE DEAN.I--I am upset to-night, Blore.I--I [_looking round._] Blore!If I don't call him back the\nSpire may be richer to-morrow by five hundred pounds.[_Snatches a book at

chapters, but there\nare named divisions: there is also Yorick-like repetition of\nsection-headings.Naturally the author attempts at the very beginning to\nstrike a note distinctly suggesting Sterne: \u201cIs he dead, the old\ncousin?\u201d are the first words of the volume, uttered by the hero on\nreceipt of the news, and in Yorick fashion he calls for guesses\nconcerning the mien with which the words were said.The conversation of\nthe various human passions with Yorick concerning the advisability of\noffering the lady in Calais a seat in his chaise is here directly\nimitated in the questions put by avarice, vanity, etc., concerning the\ncousin\u2019s death.The actual journey does not begin until page 97, a\u00a0brief\nautobiography of the hero occupying the first part of the book; this\ninconsequence is confessedly intended to be a Tristram Shandy whim.[9]\nThe author\u2019s relation to his parents is adapted directly from Shandy,\nsince he here possesses an incapable, unpractical, philosophizing\nfather, who determines upon methods for the superior education of his\nson; and a simple, silly mockery of a mother.Left, however, an orphan, he begins his sentimental adventures: thrust\non the world he falls in with a kindly baker\u2019s wife whose conduct toward\nhim brings tears to the eyes of the ten-year old lad, this showing his\nearly appetite for sentimental journeying.A\u00a0large part of this first\nsection relating to his early life and youthful struggles, his kindly\nbenefactor, his adventure with Potiphar\u2019s wife, is simple and direct,\nwith only an occasional hint of Yorick\u2019s influence in word or phrase, as\nif the author, now and then, recalled the purpose and the inspiration.For example, not until near the bottom of page 30 does it occur to him\nto be abrupt and indulge in Shandean eccentricities, and then again,\nafter a few lines, he resumes the natural order of discourse.And again,\non page 83, he breaks off into attempted frivolity and Yorick\nwhimsicality of narration.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.In starting out upon his journey the author\nsays: \u201cI\u00a0will tread in Yorick\u2019s foot-prints, what matters it if I do not\nfill them out?My heart is not so broad as his, the sooner can it be\nfilled; my head is not so sound; my brain not so regularly formed.My\neyes are not so clear, but for that he was born in England and I in\nGermany; he is a man and I am but a youth, in short, he is Yorick and I\nam not Yorick.\u201d He determines to journey where it is most sentimental\nand passes the various lands in review in making his decision.Having\nfastened upon Germany, he questions himself similarly with reference to\nthe cities.Yorick\u2019s love of lists, of mock-serious discrimination, of\ninconsequential reasonings is here copied.The call upon epic, tragic,\nlyric poets, musicians, etc., which follows here is a further imitation\nof Yorick\u2019s list-making and pseudo-scientific method.On his way to Leipzig, in the post-chaise, the author falls in with a\nclergyman: the manner of this meeting is intended to be Sterne-like:\nSchummel sighs, the companion remarks, \u201cYou too are an unhappy one,\u201d and\nthey join hands while the human heart beams in the traveler\u2019s eyes.But, apart from these external incidents of their\nmeeting, the matter of their converse is in no way inspired by Sterne.It joins itself with the narrative of the author\u2019s visit to a church in\na village by the wayside, and deals in general with the nature of the\nclergyman\u2019s relation to his people and the general mediocrity and\nineptitude of the average homiletical discourse, the failure of\nclergymen to relate their pulpit utterance to the life of the common\nChristian,--all of which is genuine, sane and original, undoubtedly a\nreal protest on the part of Schummel, the pedagogue, against a\nprevailing abuse of his time and other times.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.This section represents\nunquestionably the earnest convictions of its author, and is written\nwith professional zeal.This division is followed by an evidently\npurpose", "question": "Where is John?

Stevenson in his\ncontinuation went to extremes in exploiting this cheap device.Other motifs derived from Sterne, less integral, may be briefly\nsummarized.From the Sentimental Journey is taken the motif that\nvaluable or interesting papers be used to wrap ordinary articles of\ntrade: here herring are wrapped in fragments of the father\u2019s philosophy;\nin the Sentimental Journey we find a similar degrading use for the\n\u201cFragment.\u201d Schummel breaks off the chapter \u201cLa Na\u00efve,\u201d[11] under the\nSternesque subterfuge of having to deliver manuscript to an insistent\npublisher.Yorick writes his preface to the Journey in the\n\u201cD\u00e9sobligeant,\u201d that is, in the midst of the narrative itself.Schummel\nmodifies the eccentricity merely by placing his foreword at the end of\nthe volume.The value of it, he says, will repay the reader for waiting\nso long,--a\u00a0statement which finds little justification in the preface\nitself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Diable, mein\nR\u00fccken, mein Fuss!\u201d and so on for half a page,--a\u00a0pitiful effort to\nfollow the English master\u2019s wilful and skilful incoherence.The\nfollowing pages, however, once this outbreak is at an end, contain a\nmodicum of sense, the feeble, apologetic explanation of his desire in\nimitating Yorick, given in forethought of the critics\u2019 condemnation.Similarly the position of the dedication is unusual, in the midst of the\nvolume, even as the dedication of Shandy was roguishly delayed.The\ndedication itself, however, is not an imitation of Sterne\u2019s clever\nsatire, but, addressed to Yorick himself, is a striking example of\nburning personal devotion and over-wrought praise.Schummel hopes[12] in\nSterne fashion to write a chapter on \u201cVor\u00fcbergeben,\u201d or in the chapter\n\u201cDas Kom\u00f6dienhaus\u201d (pp.185-210) to write a digression on \u201cWalking\nbehind a maid.\u201d Like Sterne, he writes in praise of digressions.[13] In\nimitation of Sterne is conceived the digressive speculation concerning\nthe door through which at the beginning of the book he is cast into the\nrude world.Among further expressions savoring of Sterne, may be\nmentioned a \u201cCentner of curses\u201d (p.39), a\u00a0\u201cQuentchen of curses,\u201d and\nthe analytical description of a tone of voice as one-fourth questioning,\nfive-eighths entreating and one-eighth commanding (p.\u00a0229).The direct allusions to Sterne and his works are numerous.A\u00a0list of\nSterne characters which were indelibly impressed upon his mind is found\nnear the very beginning (pp.3-4); other allusions are to M.\u00a0Dessein\n(p.65), La Fleur\u2019s \u201cCourierstiefel\u201d (p.115), the words of the dying\nYorick (p.128), the pococurantism of Mrs.187), the division\nof travelers into types (p.200), Yorick\u2019s\nviolin-playing (p.274), the foolish fat scullion (p.290), Yorick\u2019s\ndescription of a maid\u2019s (p.188) eyes, \u201cals ob sie zwischen vier W\u00e4nden\neinem Garaus machen k\u00f6nnten.\u201d\n\nThe second volume is even more incoherent in narration, and contains\nless genuine occurrence and more ill-considered attempts at\nwhimsicality, yet throughout this volume there are indications that the\nauthor is awakening to the vulnerability of his position, and this is in\nno other particular more easily discernible than in the half-hearted\ndefiance of the critics and his anticipation of their censure.The\nchange, so extraordinary in the third volume, is foreshadowed in the\nsecond.Purely sentimental, effusive, and abundantly teary is the story\nof the rescued baker\u2019s wife.In this excess of sentiment, Schummel shows\nhis intellectual appreciation of Sterne\u2019s individual treatment of the\nhumane and pathetic, for near the end of the poor woman\u2019s narrative the\nauthor seems to recollect a fundamental sentence of Sterne\u2019s creed, the\ninevitable admixture of the whimsical, and here he introduces into the\nsentimental relation a Shandean idiosyncrasy: from page 43 the narrative\nleaps back to the beginning of the volume, and Schummel advises the\nreader to turn back and re-read, referring incidentally to his confused\nfashion of narration.The awkwardness with which this is done proves\nSchummel\u2019s inability to follow Yorick, though its use shows his\nappreciation of Sterne\u2019s peculiar genius.The visit of the author, the\nbaker\u2019s wife and her daughter (the former lady\u2019s maid) to the graveyard\nis Yorickian in flavor, and the plucking of nettles from the grave of\nthe dead epileptic is a direct borrowing.Attempts to be immorally,\nsensuously suggestive in the manner of Sterne are found in the so-called\nchapter on \u201cButton-holes,\u201d here cast in a more Shandean vein, and in the\nadventure \u201cdie \u00e4ngstliche Nacht,\u201d--in the latter case resembling more\nthe less frank, more insinuating method of the Sentimental Journey.The\nsentimental attitude toward man\u2019s dumb companions is imitated in his\nadventure with the house-dog; the author fears the barking of this\nanimal may disturb the sleep of the poor baker\u2019s wife: he beats the dog\ninto silence, then grows remorseful and wishes \u201cthat I had given him no\nblow,\u201d or that the dog might at least give him back the blows.His\nthought that the dog might be pretending its pain, he designates a\nsubtle subterfuge of his troubled conscience, and Goethe, in the review\nmentioned above, exclaims, \u201cA\u00a0fine pendant to Yorick\u2019s scene with the\nMonk.\u201d\n\nDistinctly Shandean are the numerous digressions, as on imitation\n(p.16), on authors and fairs (p.226-238)\n\u201cein ganz originelles Gemische von Wiz, Belesenheit, Scharfsinn,\ngesunder Philosophie, Erfahrung, Algebra und Mechanik,\u201d or (p.253) \u201cVon\nder Entstehungsart eines Buches nach Erfindung der Buchdrukerkunst,\u201d\nwhich in reference to Sterne\u2019s phrase, is called a \u201cjungfr\u00e4uliche\nMaterie.\u201d He promises (pp.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.75 and 108), like Sterne, to write numerous\nchapters on extraordinary subjects,--indeed, he announces his intention\nof supplementing the missing sections of Shandy on \u201cButton-holes\u201d and on\nthe \u201cRight and Left (sic) end of a Woman.\u201d His own promised effusions\nare to be \u201cUeber die roten und schwarzen R\u00f6cke,\u201d \u201c\u00fcber die Verbindung\nder Theologie mit Schwarz,\u201d \u201cEurop\u00e4ischenfrauenzimmerschuhabs\u00e4tze,\u201d half\na one \u201cUeber die Schuhsohlen\u201d and \u201cUeber meinen Namen.\u201d\n\nHis additions to Shandy are flat and witless, that on the \u201cRight and\nWrong End of a Woman\u201d (pp.degenerating into three brief\nnarratives displaying woman\u2019s susceptibility to flattery, the whole idea\nprobably adapted from Sterne\u2019s chapter, \u201cAn Act of Charity;\u201d the chapter\non \u201cButton-holes\u201d is made a part of the general narrative of his\nrelation to his \u201cNa\u00efve.\u201d Weakly whimsical is his seeking pardon for the\ndiscourse with which the Frenchman (pp.62-66), under the pretext that\nit belonged somewhere else and had inadvertently crept in.Shandean also\nis the black margin to pages 199-206, the line upside down (p.175),\nthe twelve irregularly printed lines (p.331), inserted to indicate his\nefforts in writing with a burned hand, the lines of dashes and\nexclamation points, the mathematical, financial calculation of the worth\nof his book from various points of view, and the description of the\nmaiden\u2019s walk (p.\u00a0291).Sterne\u2019s mock-scientific method, as already\nnoted, is observable again in the statement of the position of the\ndagger \u201cat an angle of 30\u00b0\u201d (p.\u00a0248).His coining of new words, for\nwhich he is censured by the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, is also a\nlegacy of Yorick\u2019s method.The third volume bears little relation to Sterne aside from its title,\nand one can only wonder, in view of the criticism of the two parts\nalready published and the nature of the author\u2019s own partial revulsion\nof feeling, that he did not give up publishing it altogether, or choose\nanother title, and sunder the work entirely from the foregoing volumes,\nwith which it has in fact so contradictory a connection.It may be that\nhis relations to the publisher demanded the issuing of the third part\nunder the same title.This volume is easily divisible into several distinct parts, which are\nlinked with one another, and to the preceding narrative, only by a\nconventional thread of introduction.These comprise: the story of\nCaroline and Rosenfeld, a\u00a0typical eighteenth century tale of love,\nseduction and flight; the hosts\u2019 ballad, \u201cEs war einmahl ein Edelmann;\u201d\nthe play, \u201cDie unschuldige Ehebrecherin\u201d and \u201cMein Tagebuch,\u201d the\njournal of an honest preacher, and a further sincere exploitation of\nSchummel\u2019s ideas upon the clergyman\u2019s office, his ideal of simplicity,\nkindliness, and humanity.In the latter part of the book Schummel\nresumes his original narrative, and indulges once more in the luxury of\nsentimental adventure, but without the former abortive attempts at\nimitating Sterne\u2019s peculiarities of diction.This last resumption of the\nsentimental creed introduces to us one event evidently inspired by\nYorick: he meets a poor, maimed soldier-beggar.Since misfortune has\ndeprived the narrator himself of his possessions, he can give nothing\nand goes a begging for the beggar\u2019s sake, introducing the new and highly\nsentimental idea of \u201cvicarious begging\u201d (pp.In the following\nepisode, a\u00a0visit to a child-murderess, Schummel leaves a page entirely\nblank as an appropriate proof of incapacity to express his emotions\nattendant on the execution of the unfortunate.Sterne also left a page\nblank for the description of the Widow Wadman\u2019s charms.At the very end of the book Schummel drops his narrative altogether and\ndiscourses upon his own work.It would be difficult to find in any\nliterature so complete a condemnation of one\u2019s own serious and extensive\nendeavor, so candid a criticism of one\u2019s own work, so frank an\nacknowledgment of the pettiness of one\u2019s achievement.He says his work,\nas an imitation of Sterne\u2019s two novels, has \u201cfew or absolutely no\nbeauties of the original, and many faults of its own.\u201d He states that\nhis enthusiasm for Tristram has been somewhat dampened by Sonnenfels and\nRiedel; he sees now faults which should not have been imitated; the\nfrivolous attitude of the narrator toward his father and mother is\ndeprecated, and the suggestion is given that this feature was derived\nfrom Tristram\u2019s own frankness concerning the eccentricities and\nincapacities of his parents.He begs reference to a passage in the\nsecond volume[14] where the author alludes with warmth of appreciation\nto his real father and mother; that is, genuine regard overcame the\ntemporary blindness, real affection arose and thrust out the transitory\ninclination to an alien whimsicality.Schummel admits that he has utterly failed in his effort to characterize\nthe German people in the way Sterne treated the English and French; he\nconfesses that the ninety-page autobiography which precedes the journey\nitself was intended to be Tristram-like, but openly stigmatizes his own\nfailure as \u201cill conceived, incoherent and not very well told!\u201d After\nmentioning some few incidents and passages in this first section which\nhe regards as passable, he boldly condemns the rest as \u201calmost beneath\nall criticism,\u201d and the same words are used with reference to much that\nfollows, in which he confesses to imitation, bad taste and intolerable\nindelicacy.He calls his pathetic attempts at whimsical mannerisms\n(Heideldum, etc.), \u201ckl\u00e4glich, \u00fcberaus kl\u00e4glich,\u201d expresses the opinion\nthat one would not be surprised at the reader who would throw away the\nwhole book at such a passage.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.The words of the preacher in the two\nsections where he is allowed to air his opinions still meet with his\napproval, and the same is true of one or two other sections.In\nconclusion, he states that the first part contains hardly one hundred\ngood pages, and that the second part is worse than the first, so that he\nis unwilling to look at it again and seek out its faults.The absence of\nallusions to Sterne\u2019s writings is marked, except in the critical section\nat the end, he mentions Sterne but once (p.239), where he calls him\n\u201cschnurrigt.\u201d This alteration of feeling must have taken place in a\nbrief space of time, for the third volume is signed April 25, 1772.It\nis not easy to establish with probability the works of Sonnenfels and\nRiedel which are credited with a share in this revulsion of feeling.In all of this Schummel is a discriminating critic of his own work; he\nis also discerning in his assertion that the narrative contained in his\nvolume is conceived more in the vein of Fielding and Richardson.The\nSterne elements are rather embroidered on to the other fabric, or, as he\nhimself says, using another figure, \u201conly fried in Shandy fat.\u201d[15]\n\nGoethe\u2019s criticism of the second volume, already alluded to, is found in\nthe _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ in the issue of March 3, 1772.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.The\nnature of the review is familiar: Goethe calls the book a thistle which\nhe has found on Yorick\u2019s grave.\u201cAlles,\u201d he says, \u201chat es dem guten\nYorick geraubt, Speer, Helm und Lanze, nur Schade!inwendig steckt der\nHerr Pr\u00e4ceptor S. zu Magdeburg.Yorick empfand, und dieser setzt\nsich hin zu empfinden.Yorick wird von seiner Laune ergriffen, und\nweinte und lachte in einer Minute und durch die Magie der Sympathie\nlachen und weinen wir mit: hier aber steht einer und \u00fcberlegt: wie lache\nund weine ich?was werden die Leute sagen, wenn ich lache und weine?\u201d\netc.Schummel is stigmatized as a childish imitator and his book is\ncensured as \u201cbeneath criticism,\u201d oddly enough the very judgment its own\nauthor accords but a few weeks later on the completion of the third\nvolume.The review contains several citations illustrative of Schummel\u2019s\nstyle.The first two parts were reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche\nBibliothek_.[16] The length of the review is testimony to the interest\nin the book, and the tone of the article, though frankly unfavorable,\nis not so emphatically censorious as the one first noted.It is observed\nthat Schummel has attempted the impossible,--the adoption of another\u2019s\n\u201cLaune,\u201d and hence his failure.The reviewer notes, often with generous\nquotations, the more noticeable, direct imitations from Sterne, the\nconversation of the emotions, the nettle-plucking at the grave, the\neccentric orthography and the new-coined words.Several passages of\ncomment or comparison testify to the then current admiration of Yorick,\nand the conventional German interpretation of his character; \u201csein\ngutes, empfindungsvolles Herz, mit Tugend und sittlichem Gef\u00fchl\nerf\u00fcllt.\u201d The review is signed \u201cSr:\u201d[17]\n\nA critic in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ for January\n17, 1772, treating the first two volumes, expresses the opinion that\nJacobi, the author of the \u201cTagereise,\u201d and Schummel have little but the\ntitle from Yorick.The author\u2019s seeking for opportunity to dissolve in\nemotion is contrasted unfavorably with Yorick\u2019s method, the affected\nstyle is condemned, yet it is admitted that the work promises better\nthings from its talented author; his power of observation and his good\nheart are not to be unacknowledged.The severity of the review is\ndirected against the imitators already arising.The _Magazin der deutschen Critik_[18] reviews the third volume with\nfavorable comment; the comedy which Schummel saw fit to insert is\nreceived with rather extraordinary praise, and the author is urged to\ncontinue work in the drama; a\u00a0desire is expressed even for a fourth\npart.The _Hamburgische Neue Zeitung_, June 4 and October 29, 1771,\nplaces Schummel unhesitatingly beside the English master, calls him as\noriginal as his pattern, to Sterne belongs the honor only of the\ninvention.The author is hailed as a genius whose talents should be\nsupported, so that Germany would not have to envy England her\nYorick.[19]\n\nAfter Schummel\u2019s remarkable self-chastisement, one could hardly expect\nto find in his subsequent works evidence of Sterne\u2019s influence, save as\nunconsciously a dimmed admiration might exert a certain force.Probably\ncontemporaneous with the composition of the third volume of the work,\nbut possibly earlier, Schummel wrote the fourth part of a ponderous\nnovel by a fellow Silesian, Christian Opitz, entitled \u201cDie Gleichheit\nder menschlichen Herzen, bey der Ungleichheit ihrer \u00e4usserlichen\nUmst\u00e4nde in der Geschichte Herrn Redlichs und seiner Bedienten.\u201d Goedeke\nimplies that Opitz was the author of all but the last part, but the\nreviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[20] maintains that each\npart has a different author, and quotes the preface to the fourth as\nsubstantiation.According to this review both the second and fourth\nparts are characterized by a humorous fashion in writing, and the last\nis praised as being the best of the four.It seems probable that\nSchummel\u2019s enthusiasm for Sterne played its part in the composition of\nthis work.Possibly encouraged by the critic\u2019s approbation, Schummel devoted his\nliterary effort for the following years largely to the drama.In 1774 he\npublished his \u201cUebersetzer-Bibliothek zum Gebrauche der Uebersetzer,\nSchulm\u00e4nner und Liebhaber der alten Litteratur.\u201d The reviewer[21] in the\n_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ finds passages in this book in which\nthe author of the \u201cEmpfindsame Reisen\u201d is visible,--where his fancy runs\naway with his reason,--and a passage is quoted in which reference is\nmade to Slawkenberg\u2019s book on noses.It would seem that the seeking for\nwit survived the crude sentimentality.Two years later Schummel published \u201cFritzen\u2019s Reise nach Dessau,\u201d[22]\na\u00a0work composed of letters from a twelve-year old boy, written on a\njourney from Magdeburg to Dessau.The letters are quite without whim or\nsentiment, and the book has been remembered for the extended description\nof Basedow\u2019s experimental school, \u201cPhilantropin\u201d (opened in 1774).Its\naccount has been the source of the information given of this endeavor in\nsome pedagogical treatises[23] and it was re-issued, as a document in\nthe history of pedagogical experiment, in Leipzig, by Albert Richter in\n1891.About fifteen years later still the \u201cReise durch Schlesien\u201d[24]\nwas issued.It is a simple narrative of a real journey with description\nof places and people, frankly personal, almost epistolary in form,\nwithout a suggestion of Sterne-like whim or sentiment.One passage is\nsignificant as indicating the author\u2019s realization of his change of\nattitude.The sight of a group of prisoners bound by a chain calls to\nhis memory his former sentimental extravagance, and he exclaims: \u201cTwenty\nyears ago, when I was still a sentimental traveler, I\u00a0would have wasted\nmany an \u2018Oh\u2019 and \u2018alas\u2019 over this scene; at present, since I have\nlearned to know the world and mankind somewhat more intimately, I\u00a0think\notherwise.\u201d\n\nJohann Christian Bock (1724-1785), who was in 1772 theater-poet of the\nAckerman Company in Hamburg, soon after the publication of the\nSentimental Journey, identified himself with the would-be Yoricks by the\nproduction of \u201cDie Tagereise,\u201d which was published at Leipzig in 1770.The work was re-issued in 1775 with the new title \u201cDie Geschichte eines\nempfundenen Tages.\u201d[25] The only change in the new edition was the\naddition of a number of copperplate engravings.The book is inspired in\npart by Sterne directly, and in part indirectly through the intermediary\nJacobi.Unlike the work of Schummel just treated, it betrays no Shandean\ninfluence, but is dependent solely on the Sentimental Journey.In\noutward form the book resembles Jacobi\u2019s \u201cWinterreise,\u201d since verse is\nintroduced to vary the prose narrative.The attitude of the author\ntoward his journey, undertaken with conscious purpose, is characteristic\nof the whole set of emotional sentiment-seekers, who found in their\nYorick a challenge to go and do likewise: \u201cEverybody is journeying,\nI\u00a0thought, and took Yorick and Jacobi with me.I\u00a0will really see\nwhether I too may not chance upon a _fille de chambre_ or a\nharvest-maid,\u201d is a very significant statement of his inspiration and\nintention.Once started on his journey, the author falls in with a poor\nwarrior-beggar, an adaptation of Sterne\u2019s Chevalier de St.Louis,[26]\nand he puts in verse Yorick\u2019s expressed sentiment that the king and the\nfatherland should not allow the faithful soldier to fall into such\ndistress.Bock\u2019s next sentimental adventure is with a fair peasant-maid whom he\nsees weeping by the wayside.Through Yorick-like insistence of sympathy,\nhe finally wins from her information concerning the tender situation:\na\u00a0stern stepfather, an unwelcome suitor of his choosing, and a lover of\nher own.Her inability to write and thus communicate with the latter is\nthe immediate cause of the present overflow.The traveler beholds in\nthis predicament a remarkable sentimental opportunity and offers his\nservices; he strokes her cheek, her tears are dried, and they part like\nbrother and sister.The episode is unquestionably inspired by the\nepisode of Maria of Moulines; in the latter development of the affair,\nthe sentiment, which is expressed, that the girl\u2019s innocence is her own\ndefense is borrowed directly from Yorick\u2019s statement concerning the\n_fille de chambre_.[27] The traveler\u2019s questioning of his own motives in\n\u201cDie Ueberlegung\u201d[28] is distinctly Sterne-like, and it demonstrates\nalso Bock\u2019s appreciation of this quizzical element in Yorick\u2019s attitude\ntoward his own sentimental behavior.The relation of man to the domestic\nanimals is treated sentimentally in the episode of the old beggar and\nhis dead dog:[29] the tears of the beggar, his affection for the beast,\ntheir genuine comradeship, and the dog\u2019s devotion after the world had\nforsaken his master, are all part and parcel of that fantastic humane\nmovement which has its source in Yorick\u2019s dead ass.Bock practically\nconfesses his inspiration by direct allusion to the episode in Yorick.Bock defends with warmth the old peasant and his grief.The wanderer\u2019s acquaintance with the lady\u2019s companion[30] is adapted\nfrom Yorick\u2019s _fille de chambre_ connection, and Bock cannot avoid a\nfleshly suggestion, distinctly in the style of Yorick in the section,\nthe \u201cSpider.\u201d[31] The return journey in the sentimental moonlight\naffords the author another opportunity for the exercise of his broad\nhuman sympathy: he meets a poor woman, a\u00a0day-laborer with her child,\ngives them a few coins and doubts whether king or bishop could be more\ncontent with the benediction of the apostolic chair than he with the\nblessing of this unfortunate,--a\u00a0sentiment derived from Yorick\u2019s\novercolored veneration for the horn snuff-box.The churchyard scene with which the journey ends is more openly\nfanciful, down-right visionary in tone, but the manner is very\nemphatically not that of Sterne, though in the midst the Sterne motif of\nnettle-plucking is introduced.This sentimental episode took hold of\nGerman imagination with peculiar force.The hobby-horse idea also was\nsure of its appeal, and Bock did not fail to fall under its spell.[32]\n\nBut apart from the general impulse and borrowing of motif from the\nforeign novel, there is in this little volume considerable that is\ngenuine and original: the author\u2019s German patriotism, his praise of the\nold days in the Fatherland in the chapter entitled \u201cDie Gaststube,\u201d his\n\u201cTrinklied eines Deutschen,\u201d his disquisition on the position of the\npoet in the world (\u201cein eignes Kapitel\u201d), and his adulation of Gellert\nat the latter\u2019s grave.The reviewer in the _Deutsche Bibliothek der\nsch\u00f6nen Wissenschaften_[33] chides the unnamed, youthful author for not\nallowing his undeniable talents to ripen to maturity, for being led on\nby Jacobi\u2019s success to hasten his exercises into print.In reality Bock\nwas no longer youthful (forty-six) when the \u201cTagereise\u201d was published.The _Almanach der deutschen Musen_ for 1771, calls the book \u201can\nunsuccessful imitation of Yorick and Jacobi,\u201d and wishes that this\n\u201cRhapsodie von Crudit\u00e4ten\u201d might be the last one thrust on the market as\na \u201cSentimental Journey.\u201d The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[34]\ncomments also on the double inspiration, and the insufficiency and\ntiresomeness of the performance.And yet Boie[35] says the papers\npraised the little book; for himself, however, he observes, he little\ndesires to read it, and adds \u201cWhat will our Yoricks yet come to?At last\nthey will get pretty insignificant, I\u00a0think, if they keep on this way.\u201d\n\nBock was also the author of a series of little volumes written in the\nearly seventies, still under the sentimental charm: (1)\u00a0Empfindsame\nReise durch die Visitenzimmer am Neujahrstag von einem deutschen Yorick\nangestellt, Cosmopolis (Hamburg) 1771--really published at the end of\nthe previous year; (2)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.am Ostertage, 1772; (3)\u00a0Am Pfingsttage,\n1772; (4)\u00a0Am Johannistage, 1773; (5)\u00a0Am Weynachtstage, 1773.These books\nwere issued anonymously, and Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Lexicon gives only (2) and (3)\nunder Bock\u2019s name, but there seems no good reason to doubt his\nauthorship of them all.Indeed, his claim to (1) is, according to the\n_Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_, well-nigh proven by an allusion to the\n\u201cTagereise\u201d in the introduction, and by the initials signed.None of\nthem are given by Goedeke.The books are evidently only in a general way\ndependent on the Sterne model, and are composed of observations upon all\nsorts of subjects, the first section of each volume bearing some\nrelation to the festival in which they appear.In the second edition of the first volume the author confesses that the\ntitle only is derived from Yorick,[36] and states that he was forced to\nthis misuse because no one at that time cared to read anything but\n\u201cEmpfindsame Reisen.\u201d It is also to be noted that the description\nbeneath the title, \u201cvon einem deutschen Yorick angestellt,\u201d is omitted\nafter the first volume.The review of (4) and (5) in the _Altonaer\nReichs-Postreuter_ finds this a commendable resumption of proper\nhumility.The observations are evidently loosely strung together without\nthe pretense of a narrative, such as \u201cAllgemeines Perspectiv durch alle\nVisitenzimmer, Empfindsamer Neujahrswunsch, Empfindsame Berechnung eines\nWeisen mit sich selbst, Empfindsame Entschl\u00fcsse, Empfindsame Art sein\nGeld gut unterzubringen,\u201d etc.[37] An obvious purpose inspires the\nwriter, the furthering of morality and virtue; many of the meditations\nare distinctly religious.That some of the observations had a local\nsignificance in Hamburg, together with the strong sentimental tendency\nthere, may account for the warm reception by the _Hamburgischer\nunpartheyischer Correspondent_.[38]\n\nSome contemporary critics maintained a kinship between Matthias Claudius\nand Yorick-Sterne, though nothing further than a similarity of mental\nand emotional fibre is suggested.No one claimed an influence working\nfrom the English master.Even as late as 1872, Wilhelm R\u00f6seler in his\nintroductory poem to a study of \u201cMatthias Claudius und sein Humor\u201d[39]\ncalls Asmus, \u201cDeutschland\u2019s Yorick,\u201d thereby agreeing almost verbally\nwith the German correspondent of the _Deutsches Museum_, who wrote from\nLondon nearly a hundred years before, September 14, 1778, \u201cAsmus.is the German Sterne,\u201d an assertion which was denied by a later\ncorrespondent, who asserts that Claudius\u2019s manner is very different from\nthat of Sterne.[40]\n\nAugust von Kotzebue, as youthful narrator, betrays a dependence on\nSterne in his strange and ingeniously contrived tale, \u201cDie Geschichte\nmeines Vaters, oder wie es zuging, dass ich gebohren wurde.\u201d[41] The\ninfluence of Sterne is noticeable in the beginning of the story:\nhe commences with a circumstantial account of his grandfather and\ngrandmother, and the circumstances of his father\u2019s birth.The\ngrandfather is an original", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "He had been chosen in days gone by to greet\nthe reigning prince on the latter\u2019s return from a journey, and the old\nman harks back to this circumstance with \u201chobby-horsical\u201d persistence,\nwhatever the subject of conversation, even as all matters led Uncle Toby\nto military fortification, and the elder Shandy to one of his pet\ntheories.In Schrimps the servant, another Shandean original is designed.When the\nnews comes of the birth of a son on Mount Vesuvius, master and man\ndiscuss multifarious and irrelevant topics in a fashion reminiscent of\nthe conversation downstairs in the Shandy mansion while similar events\nare going on above.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Later in the book we have long lists, or catalogues\nof things which resemble one of Sterne\u2019s favorite mannerisms.But the\ngreater part of the wild, adventurous tale is far removed from its\ninception, which presented domestic whimsicality in a gallery of\noriginals, unmistakably connected with Tristram Shandy.G\u00f6schen\u2019s \u201cReise von Johann\u201d[42] is a product of the late renascence of\nsentimental journeying.Master and servant are represented in this book\nas traveling through southern Germany, a\u00a0pair as closely related in head\nand heart as Yorick and La Fleur, or Captain Shandy and Corporal Trim.The style is of rather forced buoyancy and sprightliness, with\nintentional inconsequence and confusion, an attempt at humor of\nnarration, which is choked by characteristic national desire to convey\ninformation, and a fatal propensity to description of places,[43] even\nwhen some satirical purpose underlies the account, as in the description\nof Erlangen and its university.The servant Johann has mild adventures\nwith the maids in the various inns, which are reminiscent of Yorick,\nand in one case it borders on the openly suggestive and more Shandean\nmethod.[44] A\u00a0distinctly borrowed motif is the accidental finding of\npapers which contain matters of interest.This is twice resorted to;\na\u00a0former occupant of the room in the inn in N\u00fcrnberg had left valuable\nnotes of travel; and Johann, meeting a ragged woman, bent on\nself-destruction, takes from her a box with papers, disclosing a\nrevolting story, baldly told.German mediocrity, imitating Yorick in\nthis regard, and failing of his delicacy and subtlety, brought forth\nhideous offspring.An attempt at whimsicality of style is apparent in\nthe \u201cFurth Catechismus in Frage und Antwort\u201d (pp.71-74), and genuinely\nsentimental adventures are supplied by the death-bed scene (pp.70-71)\nand the village funeral (pp.This book is classed by Ebeling[45] without sufficient reason as an\nimitation of von Th\u00fcmmel.This statement is probably derived from the\nletter from Schiller to Goethe to which Ebeling refers in the following\nlines.Schiller is writing to Goethe concerning plans for the Xenien,\nDecember 29, 1795.[46] The abundance of material for the Xenien project\nis commented upon with enthusiastic anticipation, and in a list of\nvulnerable possibilities we read: \u201cTh\u00fcmmel, G\u00f6schen als sein\nStallmeister--\u201d a\u00a0collocation of names easily attributable, in\nconsideration of the underlying satiric purpose, to the general nature\nof their work, without in any way implying the dependence of one author\non another,[47] or it could be interpreted as an allusion to the fact\nthat G\u00f6schen was von Th\u00fcmmel\u2019s publisher.Nor is there anything in the\ncorrespondence to justify Ebeling\u2019s harshness in saying concerning this\nvolume of G\u00f6schen, that it \u201cenjoyed the honor of being ridiculed\n(verh\u00f6hnt) in the Xenien-correspondence between Goethe and Schiller.\u201d\nGoethe replies (December 30), in approval, and exclaims, \u201cHow fine\nCharis and Johann will appear beside one another.\u201d[48] The suggestion\nconcerning a possible use of G\u00f6schen\u2019s book in the Xenien was never\ncarried out.It will be remembered that G\u00f6schen submitted the manuscript of his book\nto Schiller, and that Schiller returned the same with the statement\n\u201cthat he had laughed heartily at some of the whims.[49]\u201d Garve, in a\nletter dated March 8, 1875, speaks of G\u00f6schen\u2019s book in terms of\nmoderate praise.[50]\n\nThe \u201cEmpfindsame Reise von Oldenburg nach Bremen,\u201d[51] the author of\nwhich was a Hanoverian army officer, H.\u00a0J. C.\u00a0Hedemann, is characterized\nby Ebeling as emphatically not inspired by Sterne.[52] Although it is\nnot a sentimental journey, as Schummel and Jacobi and Bock conceived it,\nand is thus not an example of the earliest period of imitation, and\nalthough it contains no passages of teary sentimentality in attitude\ntoward man and beast, one must hesitate in denying all connection with\nSterne\u2019s manner.It would seem as if, having outgrown the earlier\nYorick, awakened from dubious, fine-spun dreams of human brotherhood,\nperhaps by the rude clatter of the French revolution, certain would-be\nmen of letters turned to Yorick again and saw, as through a glass\ndarkly, that other element of his nature, and tried in lumbering,\nTeutonic way to adopt his whimsicality, shorn now of sentimentalism, and\nto build success for their wares on remembrance of a defaced idol.This\nview of later sentimental journeying is practically acknowledged at any\nrate in a contemporary review, the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_ for\nAugust 22, 1796, which remarks: \u201cA\u00a0sentimental voyage ist ein Quodlibet,\nwo einige bekannte Sachen und Namen gezwungenen Wiz und matten Scherz\nheben sollen.\u201d[53]\n\nHedemann\u2019s book is conspicuous in its effort to be whimsical and is\nopenly satirical in regard to the sentimentalism of former travelers.His endeavor is markedly in Sterne\u2019s manner in his attitude toward the\nwriting of the book, his conversation about the difficulty of managing\nthe material, his discussion with himself and the reader about the\nvarious parts of the book.Quite in Sterne\u2019s fashion, and to be\nassociated with Sterne\u2019s frequent promises of chapters, and statements\nconcerning embarrassment of material, is conceived his determination \u201cto\nmention some things beforehand about which I don\u2019t know anything to\nsay,\u201d and his rather humorous enumeration of them.The author satirizes\nthe real sentimental traveler of Sterne\u2019s earlier imitators in the\nfollowing passage (second chapter):\n\n\u201cIt really must be a great misfortune, an exceedingly vexatious case,\nif no sentimental scenes occur to a sentimental traveler, but this is\nsurely not the case; only the subjects, which offer themselves must be\nmanaged with strict economy.If one leaps over the most interesting\nevents entirely, one is in danger, indeed, of losing everything, at\nleast of not filling many pages.\u201d\n\nLikewise in the following account of a sentimental adventure, the\nsatirical purpose is evident.He has not gone far on his journey when he\nis met by a troop of children; with unsentimental coldness he determines\nthat there is a \u201cSchlagbaum\u201d in the way.After the children have opened\nthe barrier, he debates with himself to which child to give his little\ncoin, concludes, as a \u201csentimental traveler,\u201d to give it to the other\nsex, then there is nothing left to do but to follow his instinct.He\nreflects long with himself whether he was right in so doing,--all of\nwhich is a deliberate jest at the hesitation with reference to trivial\nacts, the self-examination with regard to the minutiae of past conduct,\nwhich was copied by Sterne\u2019s imitators from numerous instances in the\nworks of Yorick.Satirical also is his vision in Chapter VII, in which\nhe beholds the temple of stupidity where lofty stupidity sits on a paper\nthrone; and of particular significance here is the explanation that the\nwhole company who do \u201cerhabene Dummheit\u201d honor formerly lived in cities\nof the kingdom, but \u201cnow they are on journeys.\u201d Further examples of a\nhumorous manner akin to Sterne are: his statement that it would be a\n\u201cgreat error\u201d to write an account of a journey without weaving in an\nanecdote of a prince, his claim that he has fulfilled all duties of such\na traveler save to fall in love, his resolve to accomplish it, and his\nformal declaration: \u201cI, the undersigned, do vow and make promise to be\nin love before twenty-four hours are past.\u201d The story with which his\nvolume closes, \u201cDas St\u00e4ndchen,\u201d is rather entertaining and is told\ngraphically, easily, without whim or satire, yet not without a Sternian\n_double entendre_.[54]\n\nAnother work in which sentimentalism has dwindled away to a grinning\nshade, and a certain irresponsible, light-hearted attitude is the sole\nremaining connection with the great progenitor, is probably the\n\u201cEmpfindsame Reise nach Schilda\u201d (Leipzig, 1793), by Andreas Geo.von Rabenau, which is reviewed in the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_\n(1794, I, p.416) as a free revision of an old popular tale, \u201cDas\nlustige und l\u00e4cherliche Lalenburg.\u201d The book is evidently without\nsentimental tinge, is a merry combination of wit and joke combined with\ncaricature and half-serious tilting against unimportant literary\ncelebrities.[55]\n\nCertain miscellaneous works, which are more or less obviously connected\nwith Sterne may be grouped together here.To the first outburst of Sterne enthusiasm belongs an anonymous product,\n\u201cZween Tage eines Schwinds\u00fcchtigen, etwas Empfindsames,\u201d von L.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.(Hamburg, 1772), yet the editor admits that the sentiment is \u201cnot\nentirely like Yorick\u2019s,\u201d and the _Altonaer Reichs-Postreuter_ (July 2,\n1772) adds that \u201cnot at all like Yorick\u2019s\u201d would have been nearer the\ntruth.This book is mentioned by Hillebrand with implication that it is\nthe extreme example of the absurd sentimental tendency, probably judging\nmerely from the title,[56] for the book is doubtless merely thoughtful,\ncontemplative, with a minimum of overwrought feeling.According to the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (1775, pp.592-3),\nanother product of the earlier seventies, the \u201cLeben und Schicksale des\nMartin Dickius,\u201d by Johann Moritz Schwager, is in many places a clever\nimitation of Sterne,[57] although the author claims, like Wezel in\n\u201cTobias Knaut,\u201d not to have read Shandy until after the book was\nwritten.Surely the digression on noses which the author allows himself\nis suspicious.Blankenburg, the author of the treatise on the novel to which reference\nhas been made, was regarded by contemporary and subsequent criticism as\nan imitator of Sterne in his oddly titled novel \u201cBeytr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte\ndes teutschen Reiches und teutscher Sitten,\u201d[58] although the general\ntenor of his essay, in reasonableness and balance, seemed to promise a\nmore independent, a\u00a0more competent and felicitous performance.Kurz\nexpresses this opinion, which may have been derived from criticisms in\nthe eighteenth century journals.The _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,\nJuly 28, 1775, does not, however, take this view; but seems to be in the\nnovel a genuine exemplification of the author\u2019s theories as previously\nexpressed.[59] The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[60] calls the book\ndidactic, a\u00a0tract against certain essentially German follies.Merck, in\nthe _Teutscher Merkur_,[61] says the imitation of Sterne is quite too\nobvious, though Blankenburg denies\u00a0it.Among miscellaneous and anonymous works inspired directly by Sterne,\nbelongs undoubtedly \u201cDie Geschichte meiner Reise nach Pirmont\u201d (1773),\nthe author of which claims that it was written before Yorick was\ntranslated or Jacobi published.He says he is not worthy to pack\nYorick\u2019s bag or weave Jacobi\u2019s arbor,[62] but the review of the\n_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ evidently regards it as a product,\nnevertheless, of Yorick\u2019s impulse.Kuno Ridderhoff in his study of Frau\nla Roche[63] says that the \u201cEmpfindsamkeit\u201d of Rosalie in the first part\nof \u201cRosaliens Briefe\u201d is derived from Yorick.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.The \u201cLeben, Thaten und\nMeynungen des D.\u00a0J. Pet.Menadie\u201d (Halle, 1777-1781) is charged by the\n_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ with attempt at Shandy-like\neccentricity of narrative and love of digression.[64]\n\nOne little volume, unmistakably produced under Yorick\u2019s spell, is worthy\nof particular mention because at its time it received from the reviewers\na more cordial welcome than was accorded to the rank and file of\nSentimental Journeys.It is \u201cM\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0..\u201d by E.\u00a0A. A. von G\u00f6chhausen\n(1740-1824), which was published at Eisenach, 1772, and was deemed\nworthy of several later editions.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.Its dependence on Sterne is confessed\nand obvious, sometimes apologetically and hesitatingly, sometimes\ndefiantly.The imitation of Sterne is strongest at the beginning, both\nin outward form and subject-matter, and this measure of indebtedness\ndwindles away steadily as the book advances.G\u00f6chhausen, as other\nimitators, used at the outset a modish form, returned to it consciously\nnow and then when once under way, but when he actually had something to\nsay, a\u00a0message of his own, found it impracticable or else forgot to\nfollow his model.The absurd title stands, of course, for \u201cMeine Reisen\u201d and the puerile\nabbreviation as well as the reasons assigned for it, were intended to be\na Sterne-like jest, a\u00a0pitiful one.Why Goedeke should suggest \u201cMeine\nRandglossen\u201d is quite inexplicable, since G\u00f6chhausen himself in the very\nfirst chapter indicates the real title.Beneath the enigmatical title\nstands an alleged quotation from Shandy: \u201cEin Autor borgt, bettelt und\nstiehlt so stark von dem andern, dass bey meiner Seele!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.die Originalit\u00e4t\nfast so rar geworden ist als die Ehrlichkeit.\u201d[65] The book itself, like\nSterne\u2019s Journey, is divided into brief chapters unnumbered but named.As the author loses Yorick from sight, the chapters grow longer.G\u00f6chhausen has availed himself of an odd device to disarm\ncriticism,--a\u00a0plan used once or twice by Schummel: occasionally when the\nimitation is obvious, he repudiates the charge sarcastically, or\nanticipates with irony the critics\u2019 censure.For example, he gives\ndirections to his servant Pumper to pack for the journey; a\u00a0reader\nexclaims, \u201ca\u00a0portmanteau, Mr.Author, so that everything, even to that,\nshall be just like Yorick,\u201d and in the following passage the author\nquarrels with the critics who allow no one to travel with a portmanteau,\nbecause an English clergyman traveled with one.Pumper\u2019s\nmisunderstanding of this objection is used as a farther ridicule of the\ncritics.When on the journey, the author converses with two poor\nwandering monks, whose conversation, at any rate, is a witness to their\ncontent, the whole being a legacy of the Lorenzo episode, and the author\nentitles the chapter: \u201cThe members of the religious order, or, as some\ncritics will call it, a\u00a0wretchedly unsuccessful imitation.\u201d In the next\nchapter, \u201cDer Visitator\u201d (pp.in which the author encounters\ncustoms annoyances, the critic is again allowed to complain that\neverything is stolen from Yorick, a\u00a0protest which is answered by the\nauthor quite na\u00efvely, \u201cYorick journeyed, ate, drank; I\u00a0do too.\u201d In \u201cDie\nPause\u201d the author stands before the inn door and fancies that a number\nof spies (Aussp\u00e4her) stand there waiting for him; he protests that\nYorick encountered beggars before the inn in Montreuil, a\u00a0very different\nsort of folk.On page 253 he exclaims, \u201cf\u00fcr diesen schreibe ich dieses\nKapitel nicht und ich--beklage ihn!\u201d Here a footnote suggests \u201cDas\n\u00fcbrige des Diebstahls vid.Yorick\u2019s Gefangenen.\u201d Similarly when he calls\nhis servant his \u201cLa Fleur,\u201d he converses with the critics about his\ntheft from Yorick.The book is opened by a would-be whimsical note, the guessing about the\nname of the book.The dependence upon Sterne, suggested by the motto, is\nclinched by reference to this quotation in the section \u201cApologie,\u201d and\nby the following chapter, which is entitled \u201cYorick.\u201d The latter is the\nmost unequivocal and, withal, the most successful imitation of Yorick\u2019s\nmanner which the volume offers.The author is sitting on a sofa reading\nthe Sentimental Journey, and the idea of such a trip is awakened in him.Someone knocks and the door is opened by the postman, as the narrator is\nopening his \u201cLorenzodose,\u201d and the story of the poor monk is touching\nhis heart now for the twentieth time as strongly as ever.The postman\nasks postage on the letter as well as his own trivial fee.The author\ncounts over money, miscounts it, then in counting forgets all about it,\nputs the money away and continues the reading of Yorick.The postman\ninterrupts him; the author grows impatient and says, \u201cYou want four\ngroschen?\u201d and is inexplicably vexed at the honesty of the man who says\nit is only three pfennigs for himself and the four groschen for the\npost.Here is a direct following of the Lorenzo episode; caprice rules\nhis behavior toward an inferior, who is modest in his request.After the\nincident, his spite, his head and his heart and his \u201cich\u201d converse in\ntrue Sterne fashion as to the advisability of his beginning to read\nYorick again.He reasons with himself concerning his conduct toward the\npostman, then in an apostrophe to Yorick he condemns himself for failing\nin this little test.This conversation occupies so much time that he\ncannot run after the postman, but he resolves that nothing, not even the\nfly that lights on his nose, shall bring him so far as to forget\nwherefore his friend J\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.sent him a \u201cLorenzodose.\u201d And at the end\nof the section there is a picture of the snuff-box with the lid open,\ndisclosing the letters of the word \u201cYorick.\u201d The \u201cLorenzodose\u201d is\nmentioned later, and later still the author calms his indignation by\nopening the box; he fortifies himself also by a look at the\ntreasure.[66]\n\nFollowing this picture of the snuff-box is an open letter to \u201cMy dear\nJ\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.,\u201d who, at the author\u2019s request, had sent him on June 29th a\n\u201cLorenzodose.\u201d Jacobi\u2019s accompanying words are given.The author\nacknowledges the difficulty with which sometimes the self-conquest\ndemanded by allegiance to the sentimental symbol has been won.Yet, compared with some other imitations of the good Yorick, the volume\ncontains but a moderate amount of lavish sentiment.The servant Pumper\nis a man of feeling, who grieves that the horses trod the dewdrops from\nthe blades of grass.Cast in the real Yorick mould is the scene in which\nPumper kills a marmot (Hamster); upon his master\u2019s expostulation that\nGod created the little beast also, Pumper is touched, wipes the blood\noff with his cuff and buries the animal with tenderness, indulging in a\npathetic soliloquy; the whole being a variant of Yorick\u2019s ass episode.Marked with a similar vein of sentimentality is the narrator\u2019s conduct\ntoward the poor wanderer with his heavy burden: the author asserts that\nhe has never eaten a roll, put on a\u00a0white shirt, traveled in a\ncomfortable carriage, or been borne by a strong horse, without bemoaning\nthose who were less fortunately circumstanced.A\u00a0similar and truly\nSterne-like triumph of feeling over convention is the traveler\u2019s\ninsistence that Pumper shall ride with him inside the coach; seemingly a\npoint derived from Jacobi\u2019s failure to be equally democratic.[67]\n\nSterne\u2019s emphasis upon the machinery of his story-telling, especially\nhis distraught pretense at logical sequence in the ordering of his\nmaterial is here imitated.For example: near the close of a chapter the\nauthor summons his servant Pumper, but since the chapter bore the title\n\u201cDer Brief\u201d and the servant can neither read nor write a letter, he says\nthe latter has nothing to do in that chapter, but he is to be introduced\nin the following one.Yet with Yorick\u2019s inconsequence, the narrator is\nled aside and exclaims at the end of this chapter, \u201cBut where is\nPumper?\u201d with the answer, \u201cHeaven and my readers know, it was to no\npurpose that this chapter was so named (and perhaps this is not the last\none to which the title will be just as appropriate)\u201d, and the next\nchapter pursues the whimsical attempt, beginning \u201cAs to whether Pumper\nwill appear in this chapter, about that, dear reader, I\u00a0am not really\nsure myself.\u201d\n\nThe whimsical, unconventional interposition of the reader, and the\nauthor\u2019s reasoning with him, a\u00a0Sterne device, is employed so constantly\nin the book as to become a wearying mannerism.Examples have already\nbeen cited, additional ones are numerous: the fifth section is devoted\nto such conversation with the reader concerning the work; later the\nreader objects to the narrator\u2019s drinking coffee without giving a\nchapter about it; the reader is allowed to express his wonder as to what\nthe chapter is going to be because of the author\u2019s leap; the reader\nguesses where the author can be, when he begins to describe conditions\nin the moon.The chapter \u201cDer Einwurf\u201d is occupied entirely with the\nreader\u2019s protest, and the last two sections are largely the record of\nfancied conversations with various readers concerning the nature of the\nbook; here the author discloses himself.[68] Sterne-like whim is found\nin the chapter \u201cDie Nacht,\u201d which consists of a single sentence: \u201cIch\nschenke Ihnen diesen ganzen Zeitraum, denn ich habe ihn ruhig\nverschlafen.\u201d Similar Shandean eccentricity is illustrated by the\nchapter entitled \u201cDer Monolog,\u201d which consists of four lines of dots,\nand the question, \u201cDidn\u2019t you think all this too, my readers?\u201d\nTypographical eccentricity is observed also in the arrangement of the\nconversation of the ladies A., B., C., D., etc., in the last chapter.Like Sterne, our author makes lists of things; probably inspired by\nYorick\u2019s apostrophe to the \u201cSensorium\u201d is our traveler\u2019s appeal to the\nspring of joy.The description of the fashion of walking observed in the\nmaid in the moon is reminiscent of a similar passage in Schummel\u2019s\njourney.G\u00f6chhausen\u2019s own work, untrammeled by outside influence, is\nconsiderable, largely a genial satire on critics and philosophers;\nhis stay in the moon is a kind of Utopian fancy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.The literary journals accepted G\u00f6chhausen\u2019s work as a Yorick imitation,\ncondemned it as such apologetically, but found much in the book worthy\nof their praise.[69]\n\nProbably the best known novel which adopts in considerable measure the\nstyle of Tristram Shandy is Wezel\u2019s once famous \u201cTobias Knaut,\u201d the\n\u201cLebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts des Weisen sonst Stammler genannt,\naus Familiennachrichten gesammelt.\u201d[70] In this work the influence of\nFielding is felt parallel to that of Sterne.The historians of\nliterature all accord the book a high place among humorous efforts of\nthe period, crediting the author with wit, narrative ability, knowledge\nof human nature and full consciousness of plan and purpose.[71] They\nunite also in the opinion that \u201cTobias Knaut\u201d places Wezel in the ranks\nof Sterne imitators, but this can be accepted only guardedly, for in\npart the novel must be regarded as a satire on \u201cEmpfindsamkeit\u201d and\nhence in some measure be classified as an opposing force to Sterne\u2019s\ndominion, especially to the distinctively German Sterne.That this\nimpulse, which later became the guiding principle of \u201cWilhelmine Arend,\u201d\nwas already strong in \u201cTobias Knaut\u201d is hinted at by Gervinus, but\npassed over in silence by other writers.Kurz, following Wieland, who\nreviewed the novel in his _Merkur_, finds that the influence of Sterne\nwas baneful.Other contemporary reviews deplored the imitation as\nobscuring and stultifying the undeniable and genuinely original talents\nof the author.[72]\n\nA brief investigation of Wezel\u2019s novel will easily demonstrate his\nindebtedness to Sterne.Yet Wezel in his preface, anticipating the\ncharge of imitation, asserts that he had not read Shandy when \u201cTobias\u201d\nwas begun.Possibly he intends this assertion as a whim, for he quotes\nTristram at some length.[73] This inconsistency is occasion for censure\non the part of the reviewers.Wezel\u2019s story begins, like Shandy, \u201cab ovo,\u201d and, in resemblance to\nSterne\u2019s masterpiece, the connection between the condition of the child\nbefore its birth and its subsequent life and character is insisted upon.The work is episodical and\ndigressive, but in a more extensive way than Shandy; the episodes in\nSterne\u2019s novel are yet part and parcel of the story, infused with the\npersonality of the writer, and linked indissolubly to the little family\nof originals whose sayings and doings are immortalized by Sterne.This\nis not true of Wezel: his episodes and digressions are much more purely\nextraneous in event, and nature of interest.The story of the new-found\nson, which fills sixty-four pages, is like a story within a story, for\nits connection with the Knaut family is very remote.This very story,\ninterpolated as it is, is itself again interrupted by a seven-page\ndigression concerning Tyrus, Alexander, Pipin and Charlemagne, which the\nauthor states is taken from the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of\nhis \u201cLateinische Pneumatologie,\u201d--a\u00a0genuine Sternian pretense, reminding\none of the \u201cTristrapaedia.\u201d Whimsicality of manner distinctly\nreminiscent of Sterne is found in his mock-scientific catalogues or\nlists of things, as in Chapter III, \u201cDeduktionen, Dissertationen,\nArgumentationen a priori und a posteriori,\u201d and so on; plainly adapted\nfrom Sterne\u2019s idiosyncrasy of form is the advertisement which in large\nred letters occupies the middle of a page in the twenty-first chapter of\nthe second volume, which reads as follows: \u201cDienst-freundliche Anzeige.Jedermann, der an ernsten Gespr\u00e4chen keinen Gefallen findet, wird\nfreundschaftlich ersucht alle folgende Bl\u00e4tter, deren Inhalt einem\nGespr\u00e4che \u00e4hnlich sieht, wohlbed\u00e4chtig zu \u00fcberschlagen, d.h.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.von dieser\nAnzeige an gerechnet.Darauf denke ich, soll jedermanniglich vom 22.Absatze fahren k\u00f6nnen,--Cuique Suum.\u201d The following page is blank: this\nis closely akin to Sterne\u2019s vagaries.Like Sterne, he makes promise of\nchapter-subject.[74] Similarly dependent on Sterne\u2019s example, is the\nFragment in Chapter VIII, Volume III, which breaks off suddenly under\nthe plea that the rest could not be found.Like Sterne, our author\nsatirizes detailed description in the excessive account of the\ninfinitesimals of personal discomfort after a carouse.[75] He makes also\nobscure whimsical allusions, accompanied by typographical eccentricities\n(I, p.\u00a0153).To be connected with the story of the Abbess of Andouillets\nis the humor \u201cMan leuterirte, appelirte--irte,--irte,--irte.\u201d\n\nThe author\u2019s perplexities in managing the composition of the book are\nsketched in a way undoubtedly derived from Sterne,--for example, the\nbeginning of Chapter IX in Volume III is a lament over the difficulties\nof chronicling what has happened during the preceding learned\ndisquisition.When Tobias in anger begins to beat his horse, this is\naccompanied by the sighs of the author, a\u00a0really audible one being put\nin a footnote, the whole forming a whimsy of narrative style for which\nSterne must be held responsible.Similar to this is the author\u2019s\nstatement (Chap.II), that Lucian, Swift, Pope, Wieland and\nall the rest could not unite the characteristics which had just been\npredicated of Selmann.Like Sterne, Wezel converses with the reader\nabout the way of telling the story, indulging[76] in a mock-serious line\nof reasoning with meaningless Sternesque dashes.Further conversation\nwith the reader is found at the beginning of Chapter III in Volume I,\nand in Chapter VIII of the first volume, he cries, \u201cWake up, ladies and\ngentlemen,\u201d and continues at some length a conversation with these\nfancied personages about the progress of the book.Wezel in a few cases\nadopted the worst feature of Sterne\u2019s work and was guilty of bad taste\nin precisely Yorick\u2019s style: Tobias\u2019s adventure with the so-called\nsoldier\u2019s wife, after he has run away from home, is a case in point, but\nthe following adventure with the two maidens while Tobias is bathing in\nthe pool is distinctly suggestive of Fielding.Sterne\u2019s indecent\nsuggestion is also followed in the hints at the possible occasion of the\nOriginal\u2019s aversion to women.A\u00a0similar censure could be spoken\nregarding the adventure in the tavern,[77] where the author hesitates on\nthe edge of grossness.Wezel joined other imitators of Yorick in using as a motif the\naccidental interest of lost documents, or papers: here the poems of the\n\u201cOriginal,\u201d left behind in the hotel, played their r\u00f4le in the tale.The treatment of the wandering boy by the kindly peasant is clearly an\nimitation of Yorick\u2019s famous visit in the rural cottage.A\u00a0parallel to\nWalter Shandy\u2019s theory of the dependence of great events on trifles is\nfound in the story of the volume of Tacitus, which by chance suggested\nthe sleeping potion for Frau v. L., or that Tobias\u2019s inability to take\noff his hat with his right hand was influential on the boy\u2019s future\nlife.This is a reminder of Tristram\u2019s obliquity in his manner of\nsetting up his top.As in Shandy, there is a discussion about the\nlocation of the soul.The character of Selmann is a compound of Yorick\nand the elder Shandy, with a tinge of satiric exaggeration, meant to\nchastise the thirst for \u201coriginals\u201d and overwrought sentimentalism.His\ngenerosity and sensitiveness to human pain is like Yorick.As a boy he\nwould empty his purse into the bosom of a poor man; but his daily life\nwas one round of Shandean speculation, largely about the relationships\nof trivial things: for example, his yearly periods of investigating his\nmotives in inviting his neighbors Herr v.Wezel\u2019s satire on the craze for originality is exemplified in the\naccount of the \u201cOriginal\u201d (Chap.II), who was cold when\nothers were hot, complained of not liking his soup because the plate was\nnot full, but who threw the contents of his coffee cup at the host\nbecause it was filled to the brim, and trembled at the approach of a\nwoman.Selmann longs to meet such an original.Selmann also thinks he\nhas found an original in the inn-keeper who answers everything with\n\u201cNein,\u201d greatly to his own disadvantage, though it turns out later that\nthis was only a device planned by another character to gain advantage\nover Selmann himself.So also, in the third volume, Selmann and Tobias\nride off in pursuit of a sentimental adventure, but the latter proves to\nbe merely a jest of the Captain at the expense of his sentimental\nfriend.Satire on sentimentalism is further unmistakable in the two\nmaidens, Adelheid and Kunigunde, who weep over a dead butterfly, and\nwrite a lament over its demise.In jest, too, it is said that the\nCaptain made a \u201csentimental journey through the stables.\u201d The author\nconverses with Ermindus, who seems to be a kind of Eugenius,\na\u00a0convenient figure for reference, apostrophe, and appeal.The novelist\nmakes also, like Sterne, mock-pedantic allusions, once indeed making a\nlong citation from a learned Chinese book.An expression suggesting\nSterne is the oath taken \u201cbey den Nachthemden aller Musen,\u201d[78] and an\nintentional inconsequence of narration, giving occasion to conversation\nregarding the author\u2019s control of his work, is the sudden passing over\nof the six years which Tobias spent in Selmann\u2019s house.[79]\n\nIn connection with Wezel\u2019s occupation with Sterne and Sterne products in\nGermany, it is interesting to consider his poem: \u201cDie unvermuthete\nNachbarschaft.Ein Gespr\u00e4ch,\u201d which was the second in a volume of three\npoems entitled \u201cEpistel an die deutschen Dichter,\u201d the name of the first\npoem, and published in Leipzig in 1775.", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "This slight work is written for\nthe most part in couplets and covers twenty-three pages.Wezel\nrepresents Doktor Young, the author of the gloomy \u201cNight Thoughts\u201d and\n\u201cDer gute Lacher,--Lorenz Sterne\u201d as occupying positions side by side in\nhis book-case.This proximity gives rise to a conversation between the\ntwo antipodal British authors: Sterne says:\n\n  \u201cWir brauchen beide vielen Raum,\n  Your Reverence viel zum H\u00e4nderingen,\n  Und meine Wenigkeit, zum Pfeifen, Tanzen, Singen.\u201d\n\nand later,\n\n .\u201cUnd will von Herzen gern der Thor der Thoren seyn;\n  J\u00fcngst that ich ernst: gleich hielt die\n  Narrheit mich beym Rocke.Wo, rief sie, willst du hin,--Du!Du lachtest dich gesund.\u201d\n\nTo Sterne\u2019s further enunciation of this joyous theory of life, Young\nnaturally replies in characteristic terms, emphasizing life\u2019s\nevanescence and joy\u2019s certain blight.But Sterne, though acknowledging\nthe transitoriness of life\u2019s pleasures, denies Young\u2019s deductions.Yorick\u2019s conception of death is quite in contrast to Young\u2019s picture and\none must admit that it has no justification in Sterne\u2019s writings.On the\ncontrary, Yorick\u2019s life was one long flight from the grim enemy.The\nidea of death cherished by Asmus in his \u201cFreund Hein,\u201d the welcome\nguest, seems rather the conception which Wezel thrusts on Sterne.Death\ncomes to Yorick in full dress, a\u00a0youth, a\u00a0Mercury:\n\n  \u201cEr thuts, er kommt zu mir, \u2018Komm, guter Lorenz, flieh!\u2019\n  So ruft er auf mich zu.\u2018Dein Haus f\u00e4ngt an zu wanken,\n  Die Mauern spalten sich; Gew\u00f6lb und Balken schwanken,\n  Was nuzt dir so ein Haus?.\u2019\u201d\n\nso he takes the wreath\u00e8d cup, drinks joyfully, and follows death,\nembracing him.\u201cDas ist mein Tod, ich sehe keinen Knochen,\n  Womit du ihn, gleich einem Zahnarzt, schm\u00fcckst,\n  Geschieht es heute noch, geschieht\u2019s in wenig Wochen,\n  Dass du, Gevatter Tod, nur meine H\u00e4nde dr\u00fcckst?du bist mir zwar willkommen.\u201d\n\nThe latter part of the poem contains a rather extended laudation of the\npart played by sympathetic feeling in the conduct of life.That there would be those in Germany as in England, who saw in Sterne\u2019s\nworks only a mine of vulgar suggestion, a\u00a0relation sometimes delicate\nand clever, sometimes bald and ugly, of the indelicate and sensual, is a\nforegone conclusion.Undoubtedly some found in the general approbation\nwhich was accorded Sterne\u2019s books a sanction for forcing upon the public\nthe products of their own diseased imaginations.This pernicious influence of the English master is exemplified by\nWegener\u2019s \u201cRarit\u00e4ten, ein hinterlassenes Werk des K\u00fcsters von\nRummelsberg.\u201d[80] The first volume is dedicated to \u201cSebaldus Nothanker,\u201d\nand the long document claims for the author unusual distinction, in thus\nforegoing the possibility of reward or favor, since he dedicates his\nbook to a fictitious personage.The idea of the book is to present\n\u201cmerry observations\u201d for every day in the year.With the end of the\nfourth volume the author has reached March 17, and, according to the\n_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, the sixth volume includes May 22.The\npresent writer was unable to examine the last volume to discover whether\nthe year was rounded out in this way.The author claims to write \u201cneither for surly Catos nor for those fond\nof vulgar jests and smutty books,\u201d but for those who will laugh.At the\nclose of his preface he confesses the source of his inspiration: \u201cIn\norder to inspire myself with something of the spirit of a Sterne, I\u00a0made\na decoction out of his writings and drank the same eagerly; indeed I\nhave burned the finest passages to powder, and then partaken of it with\nwarm English ale, but\u201d--he had the insight and courtesy to add--\u201cit\nhelped me just a little as it aids a lame man, if he steps in the\nfootprints of one who can walk nimbly.\u201d The very nature of this author\u2019s\ndependence on Sterne excludes here any extended analysis of the\nconnection.The style is abrupt, full of affected gaiety and raillery,\nconversational and journalistic.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.The stories, observations and\nreflections, in prose and verse, represent one and all the ribaldry of\nSterne at its lowest ebb, as illustrated, for example, by the story of\nthe abbess of Andouillets, but without the charm and grace with which\nthat tale begins.The author copies Sterne in the tone of his\nlucubrations; the material is drawn from other sources.In the first\nvolume, at any rate, his only direct indebtedness to Sterne is the\nintroduction of the Shandean theory of noses in the article for January\n11.The pages also, sometimes strewn with stars and dashes, present a\nsomewhat Sternesque appearance.These volumes are reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[81]\nwith full appreciation of their pernicious influence, and with open\nacknowledgment that their success demonstrates a pervision of taste in\nthe fatherland.The author of the \u201cLitterarische Reise durch\nDeutschland\u201d[82] advises his sister, to whom his letters are directed,\nto put her handkerchief before her mouth at the very mention of Wegener,\nand fears that the very name has befouled his pen.A\u00a0similar\ncondemnation is meted out in Wieland\u2019s _Merkur_.[83]\n\nA similar commentary on contemporary taste is obtained from a somewhat\nsimilar collection of stories, \u201cDer Geist der Romane im letzten Viertel\ndes 18ten Jahrhunderts,\u201d Breslau and Hirschberg, 1788, in which the\nauthor (S.\u00a0G.claims to follow the spirit of the period and\ngives six stories of revolting sensuality, with a thin whitewash of\nteary sentimentalism.The pursuit of references to Yorick and direct appeals to his writings\nin the German literary world of the century succeeding the era of his\ngreat popularity would be a monstrous and fruitless task.Such\nreferences in books, letters and periodicals multiply beyond possibility\nof systematic study.One might take the works[84] of Friedrich Matthison\nas a case in point.He visits the grave of Mus\u00e4us, even as Tristram\nShandy sought for the resting-place of the two lovers in Lyons (III,\np.312); as he travels in Italy, he remarks that a certain visit would\nhave afforded Yorick\u2019s \u201cEmpfindsamkeit\u201d the finest material for an\nAsh-Wednesday sermon (IV, p.\u00a067).Sterne\u2019s expressions are cited:\n\u201cErdwasserball\u201d for the earth (V, p.57), \u201cWo keine Pflanze, die da\nnichts zu suchen hatte, eine bleibende St\u00e4te fand\u201d (V, p.302); two\nfarmsteads in the Tyrol are designated as \u201cNach dem Ideal Yoricks\u201d (VI,\npp.He refers to the story of the abbess of Andouillets (VI,\n64); he narrates (VIII, pp.203-4) an anecdote of Sterne which has just\nbeen printed in the _Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ (1769, p.Levade in Lausanne, who bore a striking resemblance to\nSterne (V, p.279), and refers to Yorick in other minor regards (VII,\n158; VIII, pp.51, 77, and Briefe II, 76).Yet in spite of this evident\ninfatuation, Matthison\u2019s account of his own travels cannot be classed as\nan imitation of Yorick, but is purely objective, descriptive, without\nsearch for humor or pathos, with no introduction of personalities save\nfriends and celebrities.Heinse alluded to Sterne frequently in his\nletters to Gleim (1770-1771),[85] but after August 23, 1771, Sterne\nvanished from his fund of allusion, though the correspondence lasts\nuntil 1802, a\u00a0fact of significance in dating the German enthusiasm for\nSterne and the German knowledge of Shandy from the publication of the\nSentimental Journey, and likewise an indication of the insecurity of\nYorick\u2019s personal hold.Miscellaneous allusions to Sterne, illustrating the magnitude and\nduration of his popularity, may not be without interest: K\u00e4stner\n\u201cVermischte Schriften,\u201d II, p.134 (Steckenpferd);

now is\nthe chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you.\"The regiment\nleft the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we\ncaught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a\ncheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three\ntrains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and\nfiremen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men\naround me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered\nthe trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were\nclaimed as captures by General Ord's corps.The cars were loaded with\ncommissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the\nrebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly\ndown on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a\nfierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did\nbut little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by\na dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel\nPennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily\nskirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily\nconstructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which\nimmense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was\nordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's\nlines, but failed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest\nof the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then\nCuster, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and\ncharge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without\norganization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and\neverywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize\nwas so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel\ninfantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and\ndestruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so\nas soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,\nonly to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting\nwould not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the\noffensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I\nwent to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would\nlet me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He\nexcitedly replied, \"Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything\nyou can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold\nof the pike to-night.\"Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by\nme, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other\nregiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge\ndown a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery\nwas posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright\nlights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot\nswept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The\nline was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,\nnow pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither\nprisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and\nartillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and\nheaded for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we\ndiscovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit\nwas checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his\nroute to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that\nour cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our\nmen dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant\nColonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a\npicket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other\ndivisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late\nto take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took\nhours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the\nrailroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground\nto rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our\nassistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line\nwould be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work\nto head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud\nhurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming\nin rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving\ntowards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing\nlively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry\ncorps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the\nposition of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who\ngreeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to \"run the gauntlet\" of fire from the enemy's\nguns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest\nof the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy\nto put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at\nlast Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving\nat almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of\na surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste\nfor the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a\nparty of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly\nreplied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a\ncharge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the\ncharge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we\nhalted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we\ncharged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front\nwas a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,\nwith batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have\ncharged this formidable array,", "question": "Where is Sandra?

to the bedroom.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon\nall became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward\nbetween the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends\namong the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee\n(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus\nWilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the\nground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I\ncalled to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a\nhostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General\nLee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General\nBabcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our\nlines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he\ngracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,\nwhich was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with\ncheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and\nthe rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.Our\nmen, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations\nwith the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that\nthe rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels\nseemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,\ndissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands\neager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to\neat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with\nColonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender\nhad taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that\neverything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in\nwhose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at\nManassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his\nname in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden\nharvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories\nof these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record\nof great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their\nheads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the\ncongratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They\nfelt they had done their duty, and given the \"tottering giant\" a blow that\nlaid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.\"She's so real that we don't\nunderstand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the\npetty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's\nall.\"\"But certainly she is unique--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people\nand telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like\nan exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after\nher as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to\nhear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that\nthe dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,\nfairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric.\"Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat.\"Yes,\" continued Father Waite, \"she is so unique that when the\nempty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been\nthrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her\nparentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was\nno engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did\nso, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing\nupon those who had tried to ruin her.\"Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle\nfilched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on\nher back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so\nunique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off\nabsently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I\nwant it to be so.'\"\"Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?\"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is\nlight.Old\nRosendo's grandson, you know.\"\"Waite,\" he said earnestly, \"she is simply illustrating\nwhat would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon\nGod's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's\nwhy she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that\nmine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to\ndo!_\"\n\n\"She is a living illustration,\" replied Father Waite, \"of the mighty\nfact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want\nyou to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the\nUtopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological\nclass.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being\nimpractical.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.\"I'll do it,\" said Hitt emphatically.\"I'll prove to Cane that her\nreligion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited\nonly by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day\nsinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,\nshe is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual\nimproves, the nation does likewise.\"I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,\"\nreturned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and\nwent, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the\nsupreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of\nthe home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not\nto have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life\nwas a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature\nvoiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted\nleaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt\ngaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: \"Oh, I feel as if I\njust couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of\nboundless good!\"For her dark\nstory had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and\neven in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked\naskance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like\nProfessor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into\nthe depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing\ninterest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of\nconvention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of\nlearning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the\nSchool of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the\ngirl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had\nchosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her\neager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she\nmet with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's\nprivate laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human\nbrain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise\nwritten large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and\nlooking at the name on the door to make certain.\"Yes,\" replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a\ngray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with\nkeen, twinkling eyes.\"Yes, indeed,\" returned the girl; \"I'd love to.\"Most everybody seems to have heard of me,\" sighed the girl.\"Well, it\ndoesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?\"She\nlooked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his\nheartstrings.\"You're as welcome as the April\nsun.\"\"Now tell me,\" she said eagerly,\nlooking about.\"That,\" said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, \"is the brain of my\nerstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into\nher eyes as she looked at it.\"In the interests of science,\" returned the man, studying her.\"That\nwe may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,\nand the laws by which it operates in mental processes.\"\"Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?\"\"You think that this poor thing held life, and you\nsearch now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;\nand 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'\"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while\nover the half-dissected brain in deep thought.\"Doctor,\" she said, \"life is not structural.God is life; and to know\nHim is to reflect life.Doctor, don't\nyou think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?\"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.The\nabrupt question quite swept him off his feet.\"You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?\"\"Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts,\" he answered,\nwondering what the next question would be.\"And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?\"she\nasked, looking intently at him.\"The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it\nnot?\"\"Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ\nof thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with\nit, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are\nintimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:\n\n\"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,\nwould you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,\naren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.\"\"But the life is not in the brain now,\" hazarded the doctor.\"You see,\" she went on, \"if\nthe brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever\nlived, it could never die.It\nmanifested only a false sense of life.Who\nor what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human\nmind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in\ndeath, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look\nwith a confident smile.\"Oh, surely,\" he replied unhesitatingly.\"Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the\nbrain, or the mind which operates it and through it?\"\"Why,\" he replied meditatively, \"it is quite likely that they evolved\nsimultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.\"\"But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really\ncome first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to\nthe thing expressed.\"\"At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a\npractical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical\nman, you know.\"\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" she said simply.\"Practical men are so\nstupid and ignorant.\"he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and\nstaring down at the smiling face.\"And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid\nand ignorant,\" she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification\nof me,\" he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to\nplace upon this frank girl.\"And evolution,\" she continued, \"is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,\nthe great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that\nmind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the\ntime.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The\nopposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called\n'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative\ntruth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real\nexistence.\"Now, the human, or\ncarnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is\ninfinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the\ninfinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole\nphysical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or\nrevealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these\nmanifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong\nsense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,\nevolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are\nthe human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal\nand perfect ideas.\"You know,\" she laughed, \"speaking of 'negative truth', the first\nchapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter\nsets forth its opposite, negative truth.But\nthere it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true\nto its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope\nthat stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously\ndown into the tube.Well,\" she suddenly asked, \"have\nyou got the fear germ here?\"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite\nserious.\"You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you\nhaven't anything but fear germs under this glass,\" she said in a low\nvoice.\"Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!\"\"And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which\nis mental,\" she added.\"These things don't cause disease,\" she went\non, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?\"\"Then I'll tell you,\" she said.\"_It's because they don't know enough\nto live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God\nwas life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He\nsinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by\nbelieving that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the\nwages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.\"She turned and perched herself upon the table.\"You haven't asked me\nto sit down,\" she commented brightly.\"But, if you don't mind, I\nwill.\"the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily\nsetting out a chair.\"I really was so interested in what you were\nsaying that I forgot my manners.\"\"No,\" she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,\n\"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead\nand cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.\"\"You are much more interesting,\" he\nreturned, \"than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was\nquite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you\ndo give me a severe classification.\"\"Well,\" she replied, \"then you are honestly more interested in life\nthan in death, are you?\"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use\nfor it,\" she continued.\"It's like making mistakes in music, or\nmathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to\ndiscuss them.The world has nearly\ntalked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated\nsickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit\nupon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases\nuntil all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive\nsins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until\nJesus came.And that cured\nthe disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,\nnearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis\ndid, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental\ncause?But,\" looking down in meditation, \"I suppose if you did that\nthe people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in\nSimiti.\"\"Then you do not believe that disease is\ncaused by microbes, I take it?\"It is a\nmanifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,\ndiphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own\ncherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders\ninnocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its\nown diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by\nhuman, material methods.At last it\nyields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls\ndeath.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various\nmanifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,\neven of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?\"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the\ngirl.\"What you say,\" he replied slowly, \"is not new to me.But I can\nonly answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which\nyou suggest.\"What mesmerism you are laboring\nunder!\"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?\"\"And I quite agree with you,\" she said firmly.\"Now the world has\ndoctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that\nhealth is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the\nhistory of all these centuries of drugging show you?\"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:\n\n\"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure\ndisease?\"\"Any more than putting men in prison cures\ncrime?\"\"They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed\ndisease,\" he ventured, not wishing to go too far.\"Doctor,\" she said earnestly, \"that man Jesus, who, according to you,\ncame too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he\ncome very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did\nnot say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,\nbut that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as\nbefore, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result\nfrom sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about\nthings.Its effect,\ndisease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with\ndrugs change a state of mind?\"\"Whiskey and opium cause changes in\none's state of mind.\"\"But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey\nand opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in\nthe human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of\nhuman consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of\nmind.And Doctor Bolton--\"\n\n\"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general\nbreakdown,\" was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table.\"What an obstinately\nobdurate lot you scientific men are!\"\"Don't you know\nthat you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there\nare no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of\nfashion, long since.\"\"Then,\" with a note of banter in his voice, \"I take it that you do not\nexpect to die.\"\"I expect good, nothing but\ngood, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that\nthe human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen\nper cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and\nsensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,\nstomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,\nand manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no\nstomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power\nwhich it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend\nupon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human\nmind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the\nChrist-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to\nbe only false beliefs.\"\"Well,\" he replied meditatively, \"if you are correct, then the\npreachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the\nconclusion that--Well,\" changing abruptly back to the previous topic,\n\"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?\"\"I said I did and did not,\" she laughed.\"Listen: fear, worry, hatred,\nmalice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest\nto the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and\nthey produce toxins, which poison the system.Now you can learn that principle, and how to\napply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your\nmaterial microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until\nyou are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all\nhuman-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or\nlife, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of\ndivine mind, God.\"Do you know,\" she pursued earnestly, \"I heard a lecture the other day\nin which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is\nonly a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is\nin a continuous state of ferment!\"\"The lecturer,\" she continued, \"said that the\nrange of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare\nbegan as a single cell.The mundane concept of\nShakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but\nShakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an\ninterpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why\ncan't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would\nchoke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!\"Well, your education seems to be--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she interrupted, \"my education is beyond the vagaries that are\nso generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false\nculture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne.\"She\nopened her note book and read:\n\n  \"'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this\n  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that\n  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of\n  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'\"Now,\" she asked, \"was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor\nmeet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of\nyour greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they\nyearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they\nbelieved in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they\nnot rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no\nsuch resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how\nto overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood\nthere before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had\ndrifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door.\"Say,\" he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, \"I'd like\nto have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I\nhave barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I\nbelieve you've been providentially sent to relieve me.\"\"You can tell Professor Hitt, and--\"\n\n\"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested\nin these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have\nregular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--\"\n\n\"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?\"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently.\"I imagine Reverend\nPat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way,\" he said.\"He is\na very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of\nhis self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see.\"I didn't really mean to come in here, you\nknow.But I guess I was led, don't you?\"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside\nthe pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the\nBeaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University\nSchool of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's\nunusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might\nhear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books\nand hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she\nlaunched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an\nastounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that\nday long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking\nexpression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short\nwhile before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from\nher soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft\nmelodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued\nfrom the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from\nthe room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving\nto interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own\nbeing, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those\nof this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her\nauditors.\"There,\" she said, with a happy sigh, \"that just _had_ to\ncome out!\"\"Who, may I ask, was your\nteacher?\"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father\nWaite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's\nwords.\"I wonder if you realize what you\nhave got, Miss Carmen?\"\"It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?\"\"But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare\nnot undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send\nMaitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?\"Oh, yes,\" returned the girl; \"I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't\nmine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien\nreturned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized\nit and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her\nbeloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant\ncoast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains\nand evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,\nRosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up\nthe Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were\nsafe.\"And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him,\" murmured the girl,\nsinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his\npossible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4\n\n\nCarmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition\nwas made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;\nand so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her\nto send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the\nessay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.Then she wrote another, and\nstill another article on the life and customs of her people.Both\nwere given publication; and with the money which she received for them\nshe bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's\nsurprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money\ntoward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and\nwas inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection.\"Indeed,\"\ncommented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, \"she would have poured\nthe money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well\nbe Jude's.\"Then she choked back the tears as she added: \"The girl comes home\nevery night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been\nin the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused\nHaynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,\nmight awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as\nhers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would\nshe furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of\nthe metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative\nsheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people\nsat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual\nangle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a\nfew of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,\nwhen his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he\nglowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding\ngenius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien\nfinancially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to\nearn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.So he\nbent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the\nUniversity--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and\nadvice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.And he\nwould trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital\npoint.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that\nshe attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the\ngreat Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand\nimpressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in\nseclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent\nrecognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity\nfor rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it\nwould help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the\n_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly\nfinished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in\nenamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the\nnewspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of\nMrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at\nvarious foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the\nformer's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no\nlonger deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned\nto conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual\nbrilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had\nhimself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,\nbecause he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of\nhis complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,\ncupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of\nwhat it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in\na flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had\nbeen pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the\nmassive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she\nturned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would\nsuffocate were she to remain longer in them.\"Perk up, little one,\" said Haynerd, taking her hand.\"We'll go round\nto the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to\nbring a lady reporter", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely\nwrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous\nbronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,\nstreamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw\nmany whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,\nswinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the\nmultimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled\nwith the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the\ntraffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept\nup and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a\nsharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood\nfor a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble\nsteps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen\nand senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one\nowed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard\nand fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual\nglance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing\nabout them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the\nground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering\never closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,\nbowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped\nblithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the\nskeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and\nshimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a\ntremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans\nof poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and\nsorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being\nwho dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the\ncarnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were\nscattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.But he\npassed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took\nimmediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage\nand to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,\nopening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them\ninto a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he\nbade them remove their wraps and await his return.\"Well,\" commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, \"we've crossed\nthe Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs.\"You will be very careful in your report,\" the latter began at once in\na business-like manner.\"And you will submit the same to me for\napproval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that\nimperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern\nsociety in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business\nand social standing, and other data.You\nwill say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered\nunder one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will\ntotal not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed\nwill foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see,\" again\nconsulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked.\"The chef,\" the secretary resumed, \"was brought over from Paris by\nMrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of\nthe famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his\nmenu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.\"\"May I ask,\" interrupted Haynerd, \"the probable cost of the supper?\"\"Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the\nneighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table\ndecorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian\nartists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the\nguest to whom it is given.\"\"Three thousand, if I correctly recall it,\" was the nonchalant reply.\"As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from\nevery part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty\nsketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand\nsalon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what\nnotes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to\nyou later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not\nexpected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to\nthe balcony, and quite out of view.\"Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the\nyoung woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony\noverlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed\nthem, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music\nfrom a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in\nthe still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as\nthey tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down\nupon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately\ntinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like\ngold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,\nwhich had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The\ngreat windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over\nwhich fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall\nand the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides\nof the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian\ncarpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the\nsalon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the\nmezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak\ndoors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at\nthe far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in\nCircassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the\nmezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping\ncurves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and\ndelicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,\ncenturies old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak\nceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid\nwith pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad\nhidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from\nburnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of\nhis imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion\nbefore this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had\nfaded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept\nremark, \"Swell--by George!\"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing\nnoiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a\ndoor below, leading off to the right from the grand salon.\"That room beyond,\" she said, \"is the petit salon.It is\nin panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now\nfrom here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,\ninstalled, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically\ncontrolled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give\nthe effect of music coming from every corner.\"\"There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for\nsculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in\nAmerica.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,\nthree Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to\nknow that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed\nto-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.\"\"Might I ask what he paid for it?\"\"You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand\ndollars for it,\" she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone.\"Now,\"\nshe continued, \"you will go back to your first position, near the door\nof the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an\nopportunity later to show you the library.Great\ncarved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare\nvolumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step\nbehind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table\nthere for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little\nwaiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at\neach other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had\nseen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in\nits alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a\nstupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before\ntheir astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the\nAmes trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were\nmagnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black\nand chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could\nnot suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure.\"And yet,\" he murmured, \"a victim, like the rest, of the great\ndelusion.\"Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying\nthe man.\"He is an expression,\" she said, \"of the American ideal--the\nideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that\nthis country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,\nthink, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly\nused!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred\nmen like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,\nand train them to do life's work!\"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose,\" returned\nHaynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further\nopportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to\nshow him the meaning of life, how to really live?\"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he\ndiscovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his\npower, have not been worth striving for!\"\"He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life,\" she murmured,\nlooking down upon the glittering throng.\"They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as\nhe stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city\nsome four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard\ntheir lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of\nmediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in\na generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight\nupon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's\nglorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to\ncoaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet\nstreet poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a\nyoung dandy of that day--\n\n                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!\"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?\"\"We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at\nthem in the best light,\" murmured Carmen.\"Aye, hang them in the best light!\"There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal\nhouse of England.I tell you, under\nthe splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?\"\"Yes,\" smiled Carmen, \"resting upon the high heel.\"muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust.\"The women of\nfashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He\ndesigned the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the\nheel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking\nimpossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and\ndeformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane\nthought.The human mind is a cave\nof black ignorance!\"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng\nbelow.\"Look there,\" said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,\nresplendent with diamonds.\"That's our eminent French guest, Madam\nCarot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by\nmeans of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,\nleaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,\nhastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her\ngowns and jewels.\"Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity.\"The Social Era got the whole spicy\nstory.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a\nhusband still, the old buzzard!\"\"Well, it's fact, anyway,\" persisted the society monitor.\"And there\nbeyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,\nred-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling\nfor mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off\nproperly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap\nheap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers\nat Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing\nmadly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them\nfrom one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately\nland a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if\nshe sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires\nheroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,\"\ntaking up his notebook, \"we must get busy now.By the way, how's your\nshorthand progressing?\"\"Oh, splendidly,\" replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive\nfigure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, \"I can write as\nfast in it now as in longhand.\"For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid\nbalcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through\nthe mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for\nher timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew\nenshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a\ngreat, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of\nhigh society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her\nboundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life\nthis sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious\nexhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,\nmagnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the\nsupreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last\nlay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that\nthere remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least\nknew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world\nwere as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest\nof self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no\nsuch garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless\nworld.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly\nannounced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she\nhad come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and\nto the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the\ntheater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand\nspectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The\nAmes trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already\noccupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of\nfifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the\nfamous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself\nwas the much discussed music drama, Salome.\"Now,\" commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was\nlost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the\nlittle theater, \"we will see something rare, for this opera has been\ncalled the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost\nhim not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see\nhere,\" drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, \"Marcou and Corvalle\nbesides!These stars get three thousand\ndollars a night during the regular season.\"Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering\naudience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was\nintroduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for\nadmittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge\nof the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the\nage-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the\nwondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,\nshe heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching\nvainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful\nDeschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell\ngloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of\na diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the\nmalignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human\nframe.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the\ndance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and\ndelicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and\ndance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,\nand ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the\nlifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final\ncurtain dropped.The passionate thirst\nfor the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--\"\n\n\"Splendid, wasn't it?\"came in tones of admiration from the social\nsecretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony\nbefore the guests emerged from the theater.\"You will run the program\nin full, and comment at some length on the expense attached,\" she went\non.\"You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,\nunabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in\na half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were\nbefore.\"Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the\nlittle table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently\nfootsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through\nthe hinge of the screen.he whispered, \"here comes Ames\nand--who's with him?Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she\nsaw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room\nat their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering.\"But we can talk undisturbed in here,\" urged Ames, his hand on the\ndoor.\"Better remain out here on the balcony,\" replied the congressman\nnervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the\nman's repugnance fully.\"You know, Wales,\" he said easily, going to the railing and peering\nover at the brilliant assemblage below, \"if I could get the heathen\nChinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a\nhundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with\nyour Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule\nwill be reported out unchanged, I presume.\"He turned and looked\nquizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been\nawaiting.\"Parsons will vote for it,\" he said\nsuggestively.Ames, is committed to\nthe high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign\ncotton--\"\n\n\"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,\neh?\"\"You don't seem to realize that in the\nend both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it\nwill come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his\nfinished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames,\" returned the congressman\ntenaciously.\"Look here, Wales,\" said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their\ncooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which\nyou have before your Committee will do it.Ames,\" replied the congressman, \"I--I am opposed to the constant\nmanipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--\"\n\n\"There,\" interrupted Ames, \"never mind explaining your conscientious\nscruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for\nthe unaltered schedule?\"Ames, I can't--\"\n\n\"H'm,\" murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an\napparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, \"I heard\njust before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the\nMercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my\npersonal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe\nyou were interested, were you not?\"He glanced at the trembling man\nout of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before\nhim and tried to steady himself.\"It--it--yes--very hard,\" murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His\nelection had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,\nexcepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had\nbeen for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been\nmatters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier\nand his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional\nhalls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his\nastonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own\ngratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the\nformal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,\nthe financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,\nand the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the\ngreat man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless\nWales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had\npenetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear\nsky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as\nhe stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy\nwith the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered\npenniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed\nto bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning.\"How much are you likely to lose by this failure?\"\"Not less than fifty thousand\ndollars,\" he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had\nbeen lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way.\"Why--I have no--this\nis not mine,\" he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at\nAmes.\"Your name's on it, at least,\" commented Ames laconically.\"And the\nbook's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've\nforgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago.\"\"Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames\nand Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand\ndollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started\nwith him down the balcony.\"You see,\" he said, as they moved away,\n\"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,\nabout that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure\nthat--\" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,\nleaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other.\"We must save them both,\" said Carmen quietly.\"I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!\"exclaimed Haynerd\nexcitedly.Ames, and\ntell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew\nthe world.\"Listen, my dear girl,\" he said, \"we will keep quiet, you\nand I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of\none who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our\nknowledge.\"I can see but the right,\" returned Carmen determinedly.\"But, my dear girl,\" cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for\nhimself and her, \"he would ruin us!We had\nno intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard.\"Haynerd, I could not, if I\nwould.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel\nto ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang\nto his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the\nscreen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young\ncompanions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their\nearnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of\nthe young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before\nsupper.\"Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames,\" explained Haynerd, hastily\nanswering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly\nrecognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved\nover Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while\nher eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched.\"When the front door\nis closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this\nhouse, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!\"\"She is a low, <DW64> wench!\"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered\nand kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a\nlow--\"\n\nHaynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her\nmouth.\"Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!\"Then, to her companions,\n\"Take her away!\"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up\nand interposed.\"I can not put them out if they have his\npermission to remain,\" he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,\nAmes himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,\"\nstaring from Kathleen to the others, \"what's the row?\"\"I want that creature put out of the house!\"demanded Kathleen,\ntrembling with rage and pointing to Carmen.\"She's on business, and has my\npermission to remain.that's a good joke,\" winking at\nHaynerd and breaking into a loud laugh.\"You put one over on us there,\nold man!\"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down\nKathleen's face.\"If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the\nhouse--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!\"\"Very well, then, run along,\" said Ames, taking the humiliated\nKathleen by the shoulders and turning her about.Then he motioned to the house detectives to\ndepart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen.\"Come in here,\" he said,\nleading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.but you belong down stairs with the rest,\" he ejaculated as he\nfaced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid.\"There isn't one\ndown there who is in your class!\"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon\nher shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face.\"And,\" he\ncontinued with sudden determination, \"I am going to take you down, and\nyou will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!\"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face.\"You mean Congressman--\"\n\nThen he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her\ncompanion.Ames's expression\nof surprise gave place to one dark and menacing.\"You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender\ngirl.\"You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a\nloan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?\"\"You\nwill not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will\nyou?You would never be happy, you know, if you did.\"Her voice was as\nquiet as the morning breeze.\"You come into my house to play spy, eh?And\nif I had not caught you when I did you would have written another\ninteresting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll\nbreak you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if\nyou dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--\"\n\n\"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,\"\nsaid Carmen quickly.\"My reputation, you know--that is, the one which\nyou people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?\"It doesn't really make any\ndifference to you, Mr.Ames,\" she said, \"whether the cotton schedule\nis passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more\nthan you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his\nwife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of\nthose priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for\nyourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let\nothers have?\"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When\nshe concluded he turned to Haynerd.\"Miss Carmen can step out into the\nbalcony.You and I will arrange this matter together,\" he said.\"Now,\" said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, \"what's your\nprice?\"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted\nAmes.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, \"I will\ncrush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the\ngutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in\nwomanhood!\"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting\ntoward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him\nfearlessly.\"We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr.\"You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal\nmind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,\nsparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and\ngreed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter\nand fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present\nlife as a horrid dream.\"Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly\ninto it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few\nmoments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the\nnearest car line.\"Girlie,\" said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, \"we're\nin for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will\nsave you.\"\"His arm is not shortened,\" she murmured, \"that\nHe can not save us both.\"CHAPTER 5\n\nON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns\nof the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the\nmagnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily\nin the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's\nprobable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought\nout an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for\nan hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little\nwife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the\nwhole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the\nUniversity.\"But,\" she\nreflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous\nSaturday evening, \"he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will\ngo to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real\nchild of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and\njealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow.\"That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again\nin the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but\nthe former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush\nwith Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her\nsustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to\nevil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one\nside.\"Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you\nwill become outwardly manifested, you know.\"muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying\ndefeat.\"And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--\"\n\n\"She did not insult me,\" said Carmen quickly.\"She could not, for she\ndoesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my\nreal self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was\nonly her own thought of me that she insulted.And such\na concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?\"\"We are going to know,\" she whispered, \"that we two with God\nconstitute an overwhelming majority.\"She said nothing about her visit\nto the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to\ntake her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping\nfor order.\"My friends,\" began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at\nthe little group, \"as we are gathered here we symbolize that\nanalytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover\nthe essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute\ntruth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our\nformer investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief\ncarries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be\nperfect, eternal, and self-existent.must\nthen receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He\nhas always existed, unchanged and unchangeable.\"A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp\na statement at once so radical and stupendous.\"True,\" continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting\nfriend, \"the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our\nprevious meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite\nobsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and\nbeautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,\npurifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our\nbelittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of\nwrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human\nceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for\nus, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution.\"Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the\nBeaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to\nwelcome him.\"I--I am sure,\" began the visitor, looking at Carmen, \"that I am not\nintruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,\nfirst; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that\nyou would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some\nlittle time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away\nfrom a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't.\"she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,\n\"I am glad you came.\"\"And I, too,\" interposed Haynerd dryly, \"for now we have two\ntheological Philistines.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.\"Ah, my friend,\" replied the doctor, \"I am simply an advocate of\nreligious freedom, not a--\"\n\n\"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art\nof giving intolerance a little more room, eh?\"returned Haynerd with a\nlaugh.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at\nthe table.\"You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?\"she whispered, with a\nglint of mischief in her bright eyes.\"No,\" laughed the genial visitor, \"he's a dead one, you told me.\"\"Yes,\" replied the girl, \"awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation\nof dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going\nto speak.\"After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the\nmeeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite\ncontinued the exposition of his subject.\"The physical universe,\" he said, \"is to human beings a reality.And\nyet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that\nthe universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which\nendures.\"\"And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?\"\"The phenomena of the universe, even as\nwe see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,\nmaturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things\nmaterial.There is perpetual genesis, and perpetual exodus.\"\"But,\" again urged Haynerd, \"matter itself remains, is indestructible.\"\"Our friend, Doctor Morton, will\ncorroborate my statement, I am sure.\"\"It is quite true,\" he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the\ntremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually\ndisappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the\nworld's text books obsolete.\"\"The radium atom, we find, lasts some\nseventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when\nit is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human\nconsciousness.\"\"And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately\ndisappear from the human consciousness?\"\"Yes,\" returned Hitt, \"I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what\nthe universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this\ntopic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those\nscientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few\nelementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--\"\n\n\"Each one of these elements is mental,\" interrupted Carmen.\"And the physical universe, even from the\nhuman standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.\"\"No,\" interposed Father Waite; \"we see only our mental concept of a\nuniverse, for seeing is wholly a mental process.\"But now,\" resumed Hitt, \"to get back to the supposed reality of the\nphysical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us\nconsider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the\nforces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to\nconclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and\nthat polytheism was untenable.\"\"We are quite agreed regarding that,\" said Father Waite.7,000 or 9,000 a year.Several endeavours have\nbeen made to extend the trade, and an effort was made to introduce\nhere the linen manufacture from Tutucorin and Coromandel, but so far\nwithout success, as may be seen from the minutes of the meeting of\nthe Council of Ceylon of January 22, 1695, where I brought forward\nseveral questions with regard to this matter.It was proposed there\nto allow private persons in Jaffnapatam to carry on a trade in cloth\non the payment of 20 per cent.duty, which proposal was approved\nby Their Excellencies at Batavia by their letter of December 12 of\nthe same year, but this subject will be treated of under the head of\nLeases.Considering further means of extending the Company's trade, it\nstruck me that Jaffnapatam was not only better situated than Calpetty\nfor the areca-nut trade with Coromandel, but also that the roads\nthrough the Wanni to the Sinhalese areca-nut forests are very good,\nso that the nuts could be transported from there in Boyados.[13] In\nour letter of October 26, 1694, to Colombo, I proposed that this should\nbe done, which proposal was referred by His Excellency the Governor\nand the Council of Colombo to Their Excellencies at Batavia.In\ntheir letter of December 12, 1695, our Supreme Government expressed\nthemselves in favour of this proposal, but in a later letter of July\n3, 1696, this was cancelled, although it is beyond doubt that this\nway of transport of the areca-nut would be more advantageous to the\nCompany.This may be seen from the fact that the Portuguese, when they\nwere here, followed the same practise, and with good success as I was\ntold.I will now leave the subject of areca-nut and revert to that of\nelephants.Many of these animals have been left here after the last\nsale in 1696, because the purchasers were afraid of meeting with a\nnorth wind on their voyage.Many vessels will be required to transport\nnot only these animals but also those that will be sold during the\nnext southern season.There being no agent now, the purchasers will\nhave to look out for themselves.And it will be necessary for Your\nHonours to give them all possible assistance in order that they may\nnot be entirely discouraged and give up this trade.Your Honours\nmust also inquire whether any suitable vessels are to be procured\nhere which could be sent to Colombo or Galle in March or April, for\nthe transport from there of the Company's elephants fit for sale: in\ncompliance with the proposals contained in the correspondence between\nColombo and Jaffnapatam of April 13 and July 11, 1695, and especially\nwith the orders from Their Excellencies at Batavia in their letter of\nJuly 3, 1696, wherein this course was highly approved.The fare for\nthese private vessels is far less than the expenditure the Company is\nput to when its own vessels are used to transport the elephants from\nGalle round about Ceylon to Cougature.If the latter course has to be\nfollowed, care must be taken that the animals are carefully landed at\nManaar, in order that they may be fit to be transported further by land\nto the place of their destination.It will also be necessary to have\nsome more of these animals trained for the hunt; because at present\nthe Company owns only about 6 tame ones, while there should be always\nabout a dozen; not only in order to fetch the elephants from Manaar\nand to tame the wild animals, but also to assist the Wannias in case\nthey should capture a large number of elephants, when these animals\nwould be useful in the shipping of those sold to the purchasers.This\nis not a regular practice, but is followed sometimes at their request\nwhen any animals are to be shipped which are not sufficiently tamed\nto be led into the vessels by themselves.Nothing more need be said\nwith regard to the elephants, except that there are about 6 animals in\nthe stables besides the 6 for the hunt mentioned above.It is to be\nhoped that this number will soon be considerably increased, and the\nprices must be regulated according to the instructions contained in\nthe letter from Colombo of January 16, 1696, and in compliance with\nthe decision arrived at on certain questions brought forward by the\nlate Commandeur Blom in the Council of Ceylon on February 17, 1692,\nand agreed upon on February 19 following; while also, and especially,\nthe instructions from Their Excellencies at Batavia contained in their\nletter of January 4, 1695, must be observed, where they order that\nno animals are to be sold or sent except for cash payment, so that\nthere may be no difficulty in recovering the amount.(7)\n\nThe trade with the Moors from Bengal at Jaffnapatam and Galle has\nbeen opened by order of the Honourable the Supreme Government of India\nin terms of their letter of August 20, 1694.It is expected that the\ntrade with the Moors will greatly benefit this country, because the\ninhabitants here are continually in want of grain and victuals, which\nare imported by the Moors.Some years ago, when food was very scarce in\nCoromandel, the English at Madraspatnam stopped the Moorish vessels on\ntheir way hither, and bought up all their rice, which was a great loss\nto Jaffnapatam.If the Moors could be induced to come here in future\nwith their rice, butter, sugar, cadjang, [14] &c., which are always\nvery much in demand, it must be seen that they are fairly dealt with,\nand not discouraged from coming to this country.Perhaps they also\nwould buy some elephants if it happened that the Company had too many,\nor if too few purchasers should arrive here from Golconda.But if the\ndemand for these animals at Golconda continues as it has done for the\nlast few years, we would not need the aid of the Bengal Moors in this\nmatter, although in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies at\nBatavia they may be accommodated with a few elephants if they urgently\nrequest them.It is the intention besides to sell to them the Ceylon\nareca-nut; as we cannot as yet transport it through the Wanni, His\nExcellency the Governor and the Council at Colombo must see that the\nareca-nut from Calpetty or Trincomalee is sent here, in compliance\nwith the instructions of Their Excellencies at Batavia as contained\nin their letter of July 3, 1696.Your Honours must therefore send in\nthe orders in due time if the Moors continue to come here, because\nwe cannot sell to them the Chiankos, [15] it being the intention of\nTheir Honours at Batavia, according to their letters of January 4 and\nFebruary 12, 1695, that this sea-product should be chiefly transported\nto Bengal on behalf of the Company.On the other hand the diving for\nChiankos at Manaar is of so little importance that it is hardly worth\nwhile mentioning here, and they are also very small, so that it is\nnot likely that the Moors would be willing to pay 12 pagodas a Cour,\nas was ordered in a letter from Colombo to Jaffnapatam of March 23,\n1695.With regard to the further restrictions put upon the trade with\nthe Moors, Your Honours must observe the instructions contained in\nthe letter of January 4, 1695.(8)\n\nThe inhabitants of this territory, who are really a perverse\nrace, are far too numerous to be maintained by the produce of this\nCommandement.This had been expected at the beginning of the Company's\nrule, when the late Commandeur, Anthony Paviljoen, stated in his\nInstructions that there were about 120,000 subjects.How much worse\nmust this be now, when, as shown by the last Census, there were of the\npeople known alone, 169,299 subjects here and in Manaar.I think there\nwould be far more if all those who hide themselves in order to escape\nfrom taxes and servitude be included.All these inhabitants are divided\ninto 40 different castes, which are described in the Thombo, so that\nI will not name them here, as this would involve too much prolixity,\nespecially if I should state what kind of services, impositions,\n&c., each one is liable to.All this I imagine to be well known to\nYour Honours; because the late Mr.Blom had given a detailed and\naccurate account of these matters in his report of August 20, 1692,\nand I could only re-write what has been already described by others;\nI therefore refer to the said manuscript, where, besides this subject,\nmuch information may be found with regard to other matters concerning\nJaffnapatam.In the same document is also found a comparison between\nthe revenue of the Commandement, with the taxes and duty it has to\nrender to the Company, in the payment of which it has been greatly met\nby the Honourable the Supreme Government of India as will be shown\nbelow.In order to prevent any misapprehension during my absence,\nI will state here the amount of the income of the Company during the\nlast year, viz., from September 1, 1695, to the end of August, 1696,\ninclusive, viz.Rent from lands, trees, and gardens      16,348.3.4 3/4\n    Tithes                                    8,632.7.3 3/4\n    Poll tax                                  5,998.1.0\n    Officie                                     865.2.0\n    Adigary                                   1,178.3.0 1/2\n\n             Total                           33,020.10.2\n    Revenue of Manaar                           879.10.2\n                                             ===============\n                                             33,900.9.0     [16]\n\n\nFrom this amount of Rds.33,020.10.2 the following expenditure must\nbe deducted, viz.Payment of 216 Majoraals at Rds.0.0\n    Payment of 218 Cayaals at Rd.0.0\n    Payment of 8 tax collectors                     320.3.7 3/4\n    Payment of 8 Sarraafs [17] or Accountants        32.3.0 1/2\n    For elephants delivered in lieu of poll tax and\n    land rent by the tamekares to the value of      373.4.0 1/2\n                                                  ==============\n                     Total                        1,375.8.1 1/4 [18]\n\n\nSo that Jaffnapatam had from this a clear revenue of Rds.31,645.2.3/9\nlast year, which is the second in importance of the sources of revenue\nwhich the Company derives from this Commandement, besides the profit on\nthe sale of elephants.So far the land rents have only been calculated\nin the Mallabaar books.We had therefore to depend entirely on the\nnative officers who were employed in this work and had to translate\nthe accounts; but the Hon.the Extraordinary Councillor of India,\nMr.Laurens Pyl, when he was Commandeur of Jaffnapatam, very wisely\nintroduced the practice of having all the fields, trees, houses, and\ngardens of the inhabitants indicated on maps, and of estimating the\nimpositions of the tithes, and thus compiling a Dutch instead of the\nMallabaar Thombo.Because, when a description was made in Mallabaar,\nin compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia in 1675\nand 1677, the yearly revenue of the Company increased by no less than\nRds.12,204 and 17/40 fanams.But as the natives were not supposed\nto have done the work satisfactorily, it was again undertaken by a\ncommittee of Dutch surveyors, who, however, wrote a great deal but\ndid not start the work in the right way, and it was never properly\ncompleted.The new description of lands had however become so urgently necessary\nthat His Excellency the Commissioner-General left orders that this work\nshould be started afresh, ignoring what had been done already.During\nthe government of Commandeur Blom this work was commenced again, some\nsoldiers who were qualified surveyors being employed in it, as well\nas such Cannecappuls [19] as were required by the Thombo-keeper to\ndo the writing, while one of the surveyors prepared the maps of the\nfields which had been surveyed.This was done with a view to obtain\na plan of each particular field and thus recover the proper rents,\nand also to fix the boundaries between the different properties.Maps\nare also being prepared of each Aldea or village and each Province,\nof which our authorities in the Fatherland desire to receive a\ncopy as stated in their letter to Batavia of August 27, 1694, which\ncopies must be prepared.On my arrival here from Batavia in 1694, the\nThombo-keeper, Pieter Bolscho, pointed out to me that this description\nof land was again unsatisfactory, and that it would not serve its\npurpose, as stated by me in the Annual Compendiums of November 30,\n1694 and 1695.It was therefore necessary to have this work done for\nthe third time, and to measure again all the lands which had been\nsurveyed already.This time a scheme was drawn up with the help of the\nsaid Mr.Bolscho, and the work has succeeded so well that the Province\nof Walligamme, which alone extends over about half of this territory,\nhas been completely surveyed, and will from the last of August yield an\nincrease of revenue of Rds.1,509.5.23 or Fl.I have\nalready written and sent out the bills, as a warning to the people\nto prepare for the payment, and the tax collectors are responsible\nfor the recovery of the amount; so that the small expenditure of this\nnew description will be recouped, and the inhabitants have no cause\nof complaint, because they are only asked to pay their due to the\nlord of the land as they ought to have done long ago.There is also\nto be recovered an amount of Rds.500.2.5 for some small pieces of\nland which were sold on behalf of the Company in 1695 in the village\nof Copay, which no one appears to have demanded, because I was in\nColombo and the Dessave in Negapatam at the time.This must be done\nnow, especially as the expenditure of the new description of lands\nhas, by order of Their Honours contained in the general resolutions\nof October 4, 1694, been written off the general revenue, to which\nmust therefore be now transferred the amount gained thereby, as also\nthe sum of Rds.288.7 which has been received by the survey of some\nlands in Sjeroepittie, Wallalay, and Nierwely, which were occupied and\ncultivated by the inhabitants, but for which they did not pay any rent\nwhile we had the old Thombo, and which we left to them for payment as\nthey had cultivated them.This was in compliance with the instructions\ncontained in the reply to our letter to Colombo of August 22, 1695,\nreceived December 15 following.If any one among you should not quite\nunderstand this new description of lands, he may find it useful to\nread certain instructions left by Governor Laurens Pyl with regard\nto this subject on February 1, 1679, for the Committee appointed\nto do this work, which instructions must be still observed so far\nas they are applicable to the present circumstances.Your Honours\nwill most likely be aware also of the extensive Memoir compiled on\nmy orders by the said Mr.Bolscho, and submitted to the Council on\nDecember 15, 1696, and of the reply thereto, as also of the report by\nMr.Blom of August 20, 1692, on the same subject, to which documents\nI here refer.The surveyors are at present at work in the Province of\nWaddemoraatsche, where they have with them two Mudaliyars, in order to\nsettle small differences which might arise among the inhabitants when\ntheir lands are being surveyed.The Mudaliyars act as arbitrators in\nthe presence of the Majoraals of the villages, but important matters\nmust be brought before the Dessave, to be disposed of by him or by\nthe Court of Justice or the Civil Court according to the importance\nof the case.The Dessave must see that the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Pieter\nBolscho, receives all the assistance he requires, and also that the\nnatives who have to serve him in this work are kept in obedience, in\norder that he may not be discouraged and lose the zeal he has shown\nso far in the service of the Company in this difficult work.Once\nthis work is completed it will not be required to be done again,\nand we will be able then to prepare separate lists not only of each\nProvince, but also of each village; so that at any time the credits\nor the debits of each tax collector may be seen.[9]\n\nThe tithes are a tax levied on the harvest, and are paid in money.Last\nyear it amounted to the sum of Rds.8,632.7.3 3/4, as shown in the\nabove account, and treated of at length in the report of August 20,\n1692.I need not therefore dilate on this subject, and only wish to\nstate that I do not agree with the concluding portion of that report,\nwhere it is stated that this tax is too heavy, and might be reduced to\nhalf the amount as requested by the inhabitants, for which many reasons\nare given pro and con.I think that it can be proved sufficiently that\nthe inhabitants are able to easily pay this imposition of the tithes;\nnot only because they have never complained against it since the year\n1690 during the stay of His Excellency van Mydregt, when they knew\nHis Excellency had the power to grant their request without waiting\nfor further instructions.On that occasion the people of Jaffnapatam\ntried every means of obtaining their wish, but it may be proved that\nsince that time they have become more prosperous--a subject which\nmay be dealt with perhaps later on.That the payment of the said\ntithes cannot be very difficult for them is proved by the fact that\nif half of the amount, viz., Rds.4,316, be divided over the total\nnumber of inhabitants, the rate for each individual amounts to but\nvery little.It is stated as a fact that the rich people possess\nthe largest number of fields, but this shows that they do not need\na reduction of the tithes.[10]\n\nBesides these tithes, one-tenth is also paid for the forests, mud\nlands, &c., which have been granted for cultivation by the successive\nDessaves to different persons with the promise of exemption from any\nimpositions for a period of 3, 4, 6, or more years; on the expiry\nof this period taxes must be paid.As I think that the Majoraals\ndo not look after these matters sufficiently well, and do not give\nnotice in time, the Dessave will have to investigate the matter and\nsee that the tenth of the harvest is brought to the Company's stores,\nespecially because the natives do not hesitate to steal or keep back\ntheir dues if they are not kept constantly in fear of punishment.The poll tax, shown above to amount to the sum of Rds.5,998.1,\nis of quite a different nature, because the rich and the poor pay\nexactly the same rate.His Excellency van Mydregt on February 28,\n1690, caused a decree to be issued, by which all the inhabitants\nwere exempted from the increase of poll tax which they had had to\npay since the year 1675, and which amounted on an average to from\nRds.But this exemption was only for the period of ten\nyears, and would have expired therefore in 1699, if the Honourable\nthe Supreme Government of India had not in a spirit of benevolence\ndecided by their letter to Ceylon of December 12, 1695, to make the\nreduction a permanent one.This was made known to the inhabitants\nof this Island on November 8 following.They showed themselves very\ngrateful for this generosity; but this must be considered sufficient\nfor the present, and they have not much reason now to insist upon a\ndecrease of the tithes also.The time for a renovation of the Head\nThombo, which has to be done every three years, has again arrived,\nand the Ondercoopman and Thombo-keeper, Mr.Pieter Bolscho, and the\nOndercoopman, Mr.Roos, were sent on circuit on November 19, 1696, in\norder to carry out this work.The names of the old and infirm people\nand those who have died must be taken off the list, and the names of\nthe youths who have passed from the schools must be entered, in order\nthat those who owe Oely service may be known.It would also be useful\nif the Dessave were occasionally present at this revision when his\nother duties do not interfere with it, because an acquaintance with\nthis work is very desirable in a land regent.This new Head Thombo\nmust be completed by the end of next August, in order that the poll\ntax and the fines for failure of performing Oely services, called\nChicos money, may be included in the Trade Accounts for each year,\nas arranged by me.[11]\n\nThe Officie Gelden have also been described at length in the often\ncited report by Mr.Blom of August 20, 1692.It is stated there\nhow these were first levied, as also how they were raised by the\nPortuguese, and how they were paid during the rule of the Company.Some\nof the castes had besides requested to be exempted from the payment of\nthese dues, and it is shown how this had been refused.Last year the\naggregate of this tax did not amount to more than Rds.It is\nalso spoken of in the Memoir of the Thombo-keeper, Piet Christiaansz\nBolscho, which was presented to the Council on October 20, 1696,\nand the approval of which was conveyed by the letter from Colombo to\nJaffnapatam of November 16 following.The instructions contained in\nthis Memoir with regard to the Officie Gelden must still be observed,\nthe chief point being that they must be demanded for each individual\nand not in the aggregate for the caste as a whole, as it has been done\nthus far, so that the Majoraals and tax collectors had an opportunity\nof appropriating a great part of the amount, which could never be\nexactly calculated.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.That they could do this easily may be understood\nwhen it is considered that most of the castes have increased in number,\nwhile the Company has received no more than the lump sum due by each\ncaste.Knowing the covetousness and avarice of the tax collectors\nand Majoraals, it could hardly be expected that they would excuse\nany one from the payment; they must, on the contrary, have demanded\nthe money from each person and appropriated the surplus collected\nby the increase in the number of people in each caste.Your Honours\nmust therefore take note of the matter, and the newly compiled lists\nmust show at a glance how much each aldea or parish owes; and as the\npayment of this tax will be fairly distributed, no one will be wronged,\nand the Company will receive its dues.[12]\n\nThe Adigary amounted last year to Rds.1,178.3 1/2.It is paid,\nlike the Officie Gelden, by every person without distinction, but\nthe only castes which pay it are the Bellales, the Chandes, and the\nTannatare.It dates from the time of the heathen kings, who used to\nrule the country through Adigars, who were appointed over the different\nProvinces, and the same method was followed by the Portuguese.These\nAdigars were not paid by the king, but the inhabitants had to furnish\nthem with victuals.This was changed in the course of time by their\nhaving to contribute to the payment of the Adigar, which did not\nexceed one fanam for each person.Although the Company, which at\nfirst followed the same practice, later on abolished this office,\nexcept in the districts of Mantotte and Ponneryn, yet this imposition\nof the Adigary remained in force on the same castes and is still\npaid by them.No one however complains of it, but on the contrary,\nthey consider themselves to be the three oldest castes, and look\nupon it as a mark of distinction and honour conferred on them above\nthe other castes, thinking that only they are worthy to contribute\nto the maintenance of the king's Adigars.It is looked upon in the\nsame light by some other castes who consider themselves equal to\nthese three, such as the Maddapallys, Agambadys, Paradeesys, &c. I\nthink, therefore, that the Company could put this point of honour\nto advantage and levy this tax from many other wealthy castes, who\nwould gladly out of jealousy allow the Adigary to be levied on them;\nbut this is mentioned here only en passant as a suggestion for the\nconsideration of wiser heads.[13]\n\nThe Oely service has, like the Officie Gelden, been described in\ndetail by the late Mr.Blom in his report of August 20, 1692, so\nthat I need not expand on this subject here.It may be seen from the\ndocument just mentioned what castes up to this time have been obliged\nto perform this service and how many men have to attend daily, as\nalso how they are classified.The same rules are still observed, but,\nas I noticed during my residence, these people are very lazy in the\nperformance of their servitudes, although they are only required to\nattend three days in every three months, or twelve days in a whole\nyear.I think this may be considered as a sign of their increased\nprosperity; because they seem to find the means for paying their\nfines for non-attendance without any trouble.This fine is only 2\nDutch stivers for each day, or 1 rix-dollar for the twelve days in\na year for each person, and the account for the year 1695 shows that\non the 24,021 men Rds.2,001.9 were paid in fines, and for the year\n1696 for eight months (January to August) a sum of Rds.1,053.9 for\n12,640 men; so that the Company during the period of 20 months had to\nlose the daily labour of 36,661 men.It is therefore to be expected\nthat the works have been considerably delayed at the Castle, in the\nloading and unloading of the vessels, at the wharf, at the gunpowder\nmill, at the brick-kiln at Point Pedro, in the burning of lime and\nthe felling of wood on the borders of the Wanni, the digging and\nbreaking of coral stones on the islands, the burning of coals for\nthe smith's shop, &c. I therefore think that the said Sicos [20]\nmoney ought to be doubled, so that they would have to pay 1 fanam\ninstead of 2 stivers for each day's absence; because I do not think\nthis must be considered as a tax levied on the inhabitants, but as\na fine and punishment imposed for negligence and as a means to make\nthem perform the necessary labour in order to prevent delay.But,\nas these my Instructions are to be revised by His Excellency the\nGovernor at Colombo, Your Honours will no doubt receive orders from\nhim, I not being", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "The reason why the last\naccount of the Sicos runs only over eight months instead of as usual\nover a year is that I specially ordered this to be done because the\naccount used to run from the beginning to the end of each year,\nwhile the Trade Accounts were closed on the last day of August,\nwhich formerly closed on the last day of February, which was always a\nsource of confusion.In order to correct this I ordered the account of\nthe Sicos to be made up for the last eight months only.Meantime Your\nHonours must not fail to see that these amounts are collected on behalf\nof the Company, because out of it only Rds.180 has been received for\nPatchelepalle for 1695; so that out of the above-mentioned amount\nfor the last 20 months the sum of Rds.2,975.1 is still due to the\nCompany.Besides the usual Caltementos received by the Collectors as\na compensation for the loss they suffer on account of those persons\nwho died or disappeared since the last revision of the Thombo, Your\nHonour must also keep in mind that a small amount is to be paid yet\ntowards the Sicos for 1693.993.7,\nand the greater part was received during my time.I do not know why\nthis was not collected before; perhaps it was due to the departure\nof the late Mr.Blom to the pearl fishery in 1699, and his death\nsoon thereafter.[21] Because, when I arrived in December of the\nsame year from Batavia, I found matters in Jaffnapatam very much in\nthe same condition in which they were on my return from Colombo last\nAugust, namely, many necessary things had been neglected and there was\ngreat confusion.I will not enter into details over the matter here,\nas I am not writing with direct reference to them.We will return\nnow to the subject of the Oely service, with regard to which I have\nmerely to add that it must be seen that the old and infirm people,\nwho are exempted from this servitude in the new Thombo, do not fail to\ndeliver such mats and pannegay [22] kernels for coals for the smith's\nshop, as they are bound to according to the customs of the country;\nbecause, although this is only a small matter, yet these things come\nin very handy for the storehouses, vessels, pearl fishery, &c., while\notherwise money would have to be spent on these mats, an expenditure\nwhich could be thus avoided.(14)\n\nThe tax collectors and Majoraals are native officers appointed by\nthe Company to demand and collect the poll tax, land rent, tithes,\nand the Officie and Adigary rates which I have treated of above.They\nalso see that the natives perform such servitudes as they owe to\nthe lord of the land, and collect the Sicos money to which I have\nreferred, levied for neglect in attending for Oely service.The\nexpenditure in the appointment of these native officers is very\nsmall, as may be seen from the foregoing account, considering that\nthese Collectors and Majoraals have to attend once in three months,\nor four times a year, at the Castle to hand over one-fourth of the\nfull amount of the taxes for the year; so that the revenue is usually\nreceived at the closing of the accounts.As this practice has proved\nto be successful, the same course must be followed in future.I would\nwish at the same time to point out here that the facility with which\nthese taxes are collected in Jaffnapatam is another evidence of the\nimproved condition of the inhabitants.In the year 1690 a change\nwas made in the appointment of the Collectors and Majoraals.Up to\nthat time all these and many of the Cannecappuls, Arachchies, &c.,\nbelonged to one caste, viz., that of the Bellales, being the farmers\nor peasants.The principal of these belong to the family of Don Philip\nSangerepulle, from Cannengray, a native of evil repute; so much so,\nthat His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor of India, Laurens Pyl,\nwho was at the time Governor of Ceylon, issued an order on June 16,\n1687, by which Commandeur Cornelis van der Duyn and his Council were\ninstructed to have the said Don Philip and several of his followers\nand accomplices put in chains and sent to Colombo.He succeeded,\nhowever, in concealing himself and eventually fled to Nagapatam, where\nhe managed to influence the merchant Babba Porboe to such an extent\nthat through his aid he obtained during the years 1689 and 1690 all\nthe advantages he desired for his caste and for his followers.This\nwent so far as to the appointment of even schoolboys as Majoraals\nand Cayaals from the time they left school.His late Excellency van\nMydregt, who had great confidence in the said Babba, was somewhat\nmisled by him, but was informed of the fact by certain private letters\nfrom the late Commandeur Blom during His Excellency's residence at\nTutucorin.Blom on July 4, 1690,\nto at once make such changes as would be necessary, under the pretext\nthat some of the Majoraals were not provided yet with proper acts of\nappointment issued by His Excellency.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.This may also be seen in the\nanswer to some points brought before His Excellency by Mr.Finding,\nhowever, on my arrival from Batavia, that these appointments were\nstill reserved for the Bellales, through the influence of a certain\nModdely Tamby, who had formerly been a betel carrier to Sangerepulle,\nlater on a private servant of Babba Porboe, and last of all Cannecappul\nto the Commandeur, and another Cannecappul, also of the Bellale caste\nand a first cousin of the said Sangerepulle, of the name of Don Joan\nMandala Nayaga Mudaliyar, I brought this difficulty before my Governor\nHis Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor of India, Thomas van\nRhee, on my visit to Colombo in the beginning of 1698.He verbally\nauthorized me to make the necessary changes, that so many thousands\nof people should no longer suffer by the oppression of the Bellales,\nwho are very proud and despise all other castes, and who had become\nso powerful that they were able not only to worry and harass the poor\npeople, but also to prevent them from submitting their complaints to\nthe authorities.Already in the years 1673 and 1675 orders had been\ngiven that the Collectors should be transferred every three years;\nbecause by their holding office for many years in the same Province\nthey obtained a certain amount of influence and authority over the\ninhabitants, which would have enabled them to take advantage of them;\nand it has always been a rule here not to restrict the appointment\nto these offices to the Bellales, but to employ the Maddapallys\nand other castes as well, to serve as a counter-acting influence;\nbecause by this means the inhabitants were kept in peace, and through\nthe jealousy of the various castes the ruler was always in a position\nto know what was going on in the country.All these reasons induced\nHis Excellency Thomas van Rhee to give me leave to bring about the\nnecessary changes, which have now been introduced.I appointed the\nCollector of Waddemoraatje as my Cannecappul in the place of Moddely\nTamby, whose place I filled with the new Collector of the Maddapally\ncaste, while also a new Collector was appointed for Timmoraatsche\nin the place of Don Joan Mandala Nayaga, whom the late Mr.Blom had\ndischarged from his office as Cannecappul of the Gate; because no two\nBellales are allowed to hold office in one place.He agreed with me on\nthis point, as may be seen from his report of August 20, 1692.I have\nfurther transferred two Collectors in the large Province of Wallegamo,\nso as to gradually bring about the desired change in the interest of\nthe Company and that of the other castes; but I heard that this small\nchange created so much disturbance and canvassing that I had to leave\nthe matter alone.The Bellales, seeing that they would be shut out from\nthese profitable offices and that they would lose the influence they\npossessed so far, and being the largest in number and the wealthiest of\nthe people, moved heaven and earth to put a stop to the carrying into\neffect of this plan so prejudicial to their interests.With this view\nthey also joined the Wannias Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar\nIlengenarene Mudaliyar in their conspiracies.The latter two, also\nBellales, well aware that they owed many elephants to the Company,\nas stated at the beginning of this Memoir, and knowing that their\nturn would also come, organized the riots in which the said Moddely\nTamby was the principal instrument.He was a man who first appeared\nas a rebel, on the plea that, having been prosecuted by the Fiscaal\nfor many offences, he had been injured by a long imprisonment and\nthat this induced him to take revenge, these same two Wannias having\nbeen then the first accusers who came to me complaining against this\nman in the latter part of 1694.Perhaps later on they considered the\ngreat assistance they received from him during the time of Babba\nPorboe in obtaining the various privileges and favours.They also\nprobably understood that it was my intention to diminish the influence\nof the Bellale caste, and were thus induced to take this course to\npromote the welfare of their caste.I think that it was also out of\ntheir conspiracies that the riots arose from which this Commandement\nsuffered during my absence in the months of May, June, and July.I\ncannot account for them in any other way, as I have stated previously\nwhen treating of the Wanni.I am obliged to repeat this here, in\norder that Your Honours may be on your guard and watch the movements,\nalliances, and associations of these Bellales and the Majoraals of the\nWanni; because although I may have persisted in bringing about the\ndesired changes, I preferred to leave the matter alone, seeing how\nmuch annoyance this first attempt caused me, and how the obsequious\nsubjects of this Commandement are not only given audience in Colombo,\nbut are also upheld against their local ruler, whose explanation is\nnot only not asked for, but who is even prevented from defending the\ninterests of the Company at the place he had a right to do.I will,\nhowever, drop this subject, although a great deal more might be said,\nbecause I consider it will be useless to do so.I only advise Your\nHonours not to make the slightest alteration in the appointment of the\nnative officers during my residence at Mallabaar, but to leave them\nfor the present in the state in which they wish so much to remain,\nas this is a matter within the province of the Commandeur.Lascoreens\nand Arachchies with their Canganes may, however, be discharged or\nappointed according to their merits by the Dessave, in accordance\nwith the instructions of the late Admiral Rycloff van Goens, dated\nFebruary 26, 1661.In the case, however, of any of the Majoraals,\n[23] Cayaals, [24] Pattangatyns, [25] Cannecappuls, or Collectors\nresigning their offices or of being dismissed on account of misconduct,\nthe Dessave will be also authorized to provisionally appoint others\nin their place without issuing the actens [26] until my return or\nuntil the appointment of another Commandeur in my place, if such be\nthe intention of Their Excellencies at Batavia.Because no provision\nhas been made for such cases, which interrupt the regular course of\nthe administration.(15)\n\nIt must be also seen that the lower castes observe the rules with\nregard to their costumes, &c., because I hear that here also corruption\nhas crept in, and that they do not wear their dress in the proper way,\ndo not cut their hair, and do not wear any golden rings in their ears,\nso that they cannot be distinguished from the caste-people or Gonoradas\nas they are called, who consider this an insult to them.A plackaat\non this subject was issued by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, Governor\nof Ceylon, on August 18, 1686.There will be little difficulty in\nenforcing those rules if the Regent in this Commandement is allowed to\nassume the authority which is his right, and which he must have if he\nis to maintain the discipline required to carry on the operations of\nthe Company, for the people of Jaffnapatam are conceited, arrogant,\nand stubborn.They bring false complaints against their rulers to the\nhigher powers if they find but the least encouragement, while on the\nother hand they are slavish and cringe under the rod of their rulers so\nlong as they see that their authority is not disputed, but is upheld\nby the Government.As they were so strictly held down to their duties\nduring the time of the heathen and of the Portuguese, not knowing any\nother but their own immediate ruler, they often do not understand\nthe position of a subordinate ruler in the service of the Company,\nand are not able to act with discretion when they find a way from\nan inferior to a superior.It is not in accordance with the natural\ngovernment to which their ancestors had been accustomed.It must not,\nhowever, be supposed that I ignore the fact that the mild government of\nthe Company always leaves a way of appeal for those of its subjects,\nwhoever they may be, when they consider themselves unjustly treated;\nbut I think that on the other hand the Company should likewise allow\ntheir chiefs to punish the delinquents before they are permitted to\nappeal to the higher powers.This I have found is not always observed\nas regards Jaffnapatam, although it seems to me necessary that it\nshould be if our officers are not in the course of time to become a\nlaughing stock to the people.It is a well-known fact that the more\ninfluential natives always try to oppress the poorer classes, and it\nwill be impossible to prevent their doing this if they are allowed\nto become stronger than they already are.The Lascoreens, who are supposed to be soldiers, appear however to be\nmore useful in times of peace for the running of errands, the carrying\nof letters, the communication of orders to and fro in the country,\nand to summon the inhabitants, than they are in times of war for\nthe carrying of arms, for they have not the slightest idea of drill\nor discipline, and are entirely wanting in courage.Yet we have to\nemploy them in these services, and it will be chiefly the duty of\nthe Dessave to see that those whose names are entered as Lascoreens\nin the Hoofd Thombo are kept under discipline by their officers, and\nalso that their number is complete, so that they may be easily found\nwhen suddenly wanted.It must also be observed that no men are entered\nas Lascoreens who are bound to perform other services.The argument\nbrought forward by His late Excellency Commissioner van Mydregt in\nhis Instructions for Jaffnapatam of November 29, 1690, that it is\nmost difficult to reduce such people afterwards to their more humble\nservice is undoubtedly true and has been proved by experience.Those\nwhose names are at present entered in the Thombo as Lascoreens amount\nto 834 men, both archers and pikemen, viz.:--\n\n\n                Arachchies                    31\n                Canganas                       4\n                Lascoreens                   799\n                                             ===\n                                   Total     834\n\n\nOf these, only 200 are paid, and sometimes less than that\nnumber, according to circumstances, as may be seen in the monthly\naccounts.They are commanded by two Mudaliyars, one over the archers\nand one over the pikemen.The Lascoreens are paid only 7 1/5 fanams\nper mensem, without rice, and they are required to be ready day\nand night to carry orders.Their pay is certainly not too high,\nespecially in such times of dearth as we have had during the last\nthree or four years, but I hope that this may be prevented in future\nto some extent when the Moors from Bengal come here more frequently\nand the rice from Trincomalee and Cotjaar is received in the required\nquantities.Otherwise I think that the request of the Lascoreens,\nif they strongly urge it, should be complied with, namely, that they\nmay be paid Rd.1 per month should the dearth continue longer.But\nthis can only be done with the special permission of His Excellency\nthe Governor and the Council of Colombo, although the Commandeur\nand the Council here have been authorized to grant this higher pay\nby His Excellency Laurens Pyl, Councillor of India, on his visit to\nJaffnapatam on June 14, 1687, when this and other requests of the\nnatives were submitted to him.But, considering that besides the\n180 or 200 Lascoreens there are also employed other native soldiers\nin Mannar, Aripo, Calpentyn, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, who are\nalso drawn from the above-mentioned 834 men, and that they have to\nbe transferred every half year, it is desirable that the same rules\nshould apply to them all, especially because a number of them are\nalso employed in this Commandement in the felling of wood, some at\nPoint Pedro under the Vidaan of the Elephants, some at Kayts in the\ndyeing industry, some under the Civil Council, others again under\nthe Collectors of taxes in the various Provinces, at the Passes,\nunder the clergy, the Fiscaal, and other of the Company's servants;\nsince in that way they will be best kept under discipline.This would\nalso prevent fraud, because each person would receive his pay direct\nfrom the Company, while at present the two Mudaliyars mentioned above\nhave a chance of favouring those whom they prefer.For this and other\nreasons Your Honours must see that the Lascoreens are transferred at\nleast once a year, if not twice.[16]\n\nSlaves from the opposite coast are brought here in large numbers,\nbecause the accounts state that from December 1, 1694, to the end of\nNovember, 1696, no less than 3,589 slaves were brought across, on each\nof whom was paid to the Company as duty for admittance the amount of 11\nfanams, making a total of 39,424 fanams or 9,856 guilders.The people\nof Jaffnapatam import these slaves only for their own advantage, as\nthey find the sale of these creatures more profitable than the trade\nin rice or nely, these grain being at present very dear in Coromandel,\nwhich again is a reason why these slaves are very cheap there, being\nprocurable almost for a handful of rice.As Jaffnapatam does not yield\na sufficient quantity of rice for its large population, I tried to\ninduce the inhabitants to import as much nely as possible, but to no\npurpose.Therefore, considering that it is likely the scarcity of the\nnecessaries of life will increase rather than decrease, because the\nMoorish vessels loaded with rice remained at Madraspatam, I thought\nit best to open the passage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa for the\ninhabitants of Jaffnapatam.I did so because I was informed that grain\nis very plentiful there and may be had at a low price, and also because\nI found that this privilege had been granted to them already by the\nHonourable the Supreme Government of India by Resolution of November,\n1681.This permission was renewed in a letter of December 12, 1695,\nbut as this was cancelled in a letter from Colombo to Jaffnapatam\nof January 6, 1696, this Commandement continued to suffer from the\nscarcity of provisions.However, the price of rice was never higher\nthan Rd.1 a parra, and even came down to 6 fanams for a cut parra,\nof which there are 75 in a last of 3,000 lb.The question arises,\nhowever, whether the Company might not be greatly inconvenienced\nby the importation of these slaves, because it seems to me that the\nscarcity of victuals would be thus increased, and I do not consider it\nadvisable for other reasons also.It is true that the Company receives\na considerable amount as duty, but on the other hand these slaves\nhave to be fed, and thus the price of victuals will, of necessity,\nadvance.The people of Jaffnapatam are besides by nature lazy and\nindolent, and will gradually get more accustomed to send their\nslaves for the performance of their duties instead of attending to\nthem themselves, while moreover these slaves are in various ways\nenticed outside the Province and captured by the Wannias, who in\ntimes of peace employ them for sowing and mowing, and in times of war\nstrengthen their ranks with them.They also sometimes send them to\nofficers of the Kandyan Court in order to obtain their favour.Many\nof the slaves imported suffer from chicken pox, which may cause an\nepidemic among the natives, resulting in great mortality.The amount\nderived from the duty on importation of slaves would therefore not\nbe a sufficient compensation.In my opinion this large importation\nof slaves is also another evidence of the greater prosperity of the\ninhabitants of this Commandement, as the purchase and maintenance of\nslaves require means.[17]\n\nRice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting in\nJaffnapatam, and, as the matter is one which concerns the maintenance\nof life, great attention must be paid to it if we are to continue to\nexact from the inhabitants the dues they are paying now.It will be\nfound on calculation from the notes of the Tarrego [27] taken for\nsome years that the inhabitants consume on an average no less than\n2,000 lasts of rice a year in addition to the quantity produced in the\nProvinces, The Islands, the Wanni, Ponneryn, and Mantotte, so that it\nis clear how necessary it is that the inhabitants are not only enabled\nbut also encouraged to import grain from outside.Besides that obtained\nfrom the Bengal Moors, they may now also obtain rice from Tanjauwen,\nOriza, Tondy, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, as the latter passage has\nbeen re-opened by order of the Honourable the Supreme Government of\nIndia at Batavia in terms of their letter of July 3, 1696, which I\npublished in a mandate in Dutch and Mallabaar on October 1, 1696.From\nthis I expect good results in future for this Commandement.I also\nhope that this will be a means of preventing the undesirable monopoly\nof victuals, with regard to which subject I refer Your Honours to the\nletter from Colombo of November 16, 1696, and the reply from here\nof December 12 following, and I again seriously recommend to Your\nHonours' attention this subject of monopoly, without any regard to\npersons, as the greatest offences are undoubtedly those which affect\nthe general welfare.(18)\n\nThe native trade is confined to articles of little importance, which,\nhowever, yield them a considerable profit, as many of the articles\nfound here are not found elsewhere.Thus, for instance, the palmyra\ntree is not only very useful to them, as its fruit serves them as\nfood instead of rice, but they also obtain from it sugar, poenat, [28]\npannangay, [29] calengen, [30] mats, carsingos, [31] and caddigans [32]\nor olas, and besides, the palmyra timber comes very handy whenever they\nfell the trees.For all these sundries the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam\nobtain good prices in Coromandel and Tondy, where also they sell\ncoconuts, kayer, [33] oil obtained from coconuts, and margosy, and\nmany other things which are not found in the places mentioned above,\nor in Trincomalee and Batticaloa.These articles are rising in price\nfrom year to year, so that they fetch two and three per cent.more\nthan formerly, and on this account the number of vessels along the\nseacoast between Point Pedro and Kayts has increased to threefold\ntheir number.With a view to prevent the monopoly of grain as much as\npossible Your Honours are recommended to follow the same method I did,\nviz., to order all vessels which come into Point Pedro, Tellemanaar,\nor Wallewitte to go on to Kayts, as the owners often try to land in\nthese places under some pretext or other.They must be made to sell\ntheir nely at the bangsaal or the public market, which is under the\nsupervision of this Castle; because if they unload their nely elsewhere\nthey do not bring it to the market, and the people not finding any\nthere have to obtain it from them at any price, which I consider to\nbe making a monopoly of it.Another product which yields a profit to\nthe inhabitants is tobacco.This grows here very abundantly, and the\ngreater part of it is sold by the owners without the least risk to the\nmerchants of Mallabaar, while the rest is sold here among their own\npeople or to the Company's servants.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.A part also is sent to Negapatam,\nbecause the passage to Mallabaar is too dangerous for them on account\nof the Bargareese pirates, who infest the neighbourhood.They also\nmake a good profit out of the provisions which the Company's servants\nhave to buy from them, such as fowls, butter, milk, sheep, piesang,\n[34] soursop, betel, oil, &c., on which articles these officers have\nto spend a good deal of their salaries, and even the native officers\nhave to devote a great deal of their pay to the purchase of these.The\ninhabitants are also able to obtain a good deal as wages for labour if\nthey are not too lazy to work, so that, taking all in all, Your Honours\nwill find that the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam are more prosperous now\nthan they have been for some time, although it has been urged in some\nquarters that they are oppressed and fleeced and are therefore in a\nmiserable condition.These people do not know or pretend not to know\nthat those reports have been circulated by some of the wealthiest\nBellales, because endeavours were made to maintain and uphold the\npoorer castes against them.Their circumstances being so much better,\nthe people of Jaffnapatam ought not to hope for a decrease of the\ntithes, as spoken of before.Nor did they ask for this during my\ntime, nor even referred to it, because at the general paresse [35]\nof August 2, 1685, they made a unanimous declaration that they had\nno request to make and no reason for complaint, and that they were\nperfectly satisfied with the rule of the Company.This may be seen\nin the Compendium of the last of November of the same year.In my\nquestions of January 22 of the same year several requests of theirs\nhad already been submitted, which had been all disposed of to their\nsatisfaction, as, for instance, that with regard to the free trade\nin Batticaloa and Trincomalee already mentioned above, while the\nother matters will be treated of later on.Blom would seem to recommend the decrease of the tithes in his\nreport of August 20, 1692, but he did not know at the time that so many\nprivileges would be granted to them.Although the granting of these is\nof little importance to the Company, it is a fact on the other hand\nthat the prosperity of the inhabitants will also be an advantage to\nthe Company, because it enables them to pay their imposts and taxes\nregularly, as witness the last few years.[19]\n\nThe coconut trees are the third source of prosperity granted to the\ninhabitants, besides the free trade in Batticaloa and Trincomalee\nand the reduced poll tax; because, in compliance with the orders from\nBatavia of December 12, 1695, these trees would no longer be subject\nto taxes in the new Land Thombo, the owners being obliged to feed not\nonly the Company's elephants, but also those which have been already\npurchased by the merchants, with coconut leaves.Although this no\ndoubt is more profitable to them, as they are paid for the leaves\nby the merchants, yet it is true that the trees yield less fruit\nwhen their nourishment is spent on the leaves.But although Their\nExcellencies at Batavia kindly relieved the people of their burden\nin this respect, the duty was imposed again in another way when His\nExcellency the Governor and the Council decided, in their letter of\nOctober 13, that Jaffnapatam would have to deliver yearly no less\nthan 24 casks of coconut oil besides that which is required for use\nin this Commandement and at Manaar.This, including what is required\nat the pearl fishery, amounts according to my calculation to no less\nthan 12 casks.For this reason it will be necessary to prohibit the\nexport of coconuts.This order, like the one with regard to the reform\nin the sale of elephants, was sent to us without previous consultation\nwith the Commandeur or the Council of Jaffnapatam; yet in the interest\nof the Company I could not abstain from expressing my opinion on the\nsubject in my reply of November 1, 1696; but as the order was repeated\nin a subsequent letter from Colombo as also in one of the 21st of\nthe same month, although with some slight alteration, I am obliged to\nrecommend that Your Honours should endeavour to put this order into\nexecution as far as possible, and not issue licenses to any one.I\ndo so although I expect not only that the farmer of the Alfandigo\n(for the export of all articles permitted to be exported) will\ncomplain on this account, and will pay less rent in future, but also,\nand especially that the inhabitants will object to this regulation,\nbecause they receive at least twice as much for the plain coconuts\nas for the oil which they will have to deliver to the Company.This\nwill be so in spite of some concessions which have been made already\nin the payment for the oil, upon their petition of June 14, 1687,\nsubmitted to His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then Governor of Ceylon,\nin which they stated that it was a great disadvantage to them to be\nobliged to give the olas of their trees as food for the elephants,\nand that they were now also prevented from selling their fruits,\nbut had to press oil out of these for the Company.[20]\n\nThe iron and steel tools imported by the Company did not yield much\nprofit, because there was no demand for them.The wealthy people\nconsidered them too expensive, and the poor could not afford to\npurchase them for the ploughing and cultivation of their fields and\ngardens.They have therefore been stowed away in the storehouses.As\nmay be seen from the questions submitted by me to the Council of\nColombo on January 22, 1695, I proposed that the inhabitants should\nbe permitted to obtain these tools direct from Coromandel, which was\nkindly granted by the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by\nletter of December 12 of the same year.This may be considered the\nfourth point in which they have been indulged; another is the license\ngiven to them in the same letter from Batavia (confirmed in a letter\nof July 3, 1696) that they may convey the products of their lands and\nother small merchandise by vessel to Coromandel, north of Negapatam,\nwithout being obliged to stop and pay Customs duty in the former place,\nas they had to do since 1687.They must not therefore be restricted in\nthis, as I introduced this new rule as soon as the license arrived.[21]\n\nThe palmyra timber required by the Company for Colombo and Jaffnapatam\nused to be exacted from the inhabitants at a very low price which\nhad been fixed for them.They had not only to deliver this, but also\nthat which some of the Company's servants demanded for their private\nuse at the same low rate, under pretence that it was required for the\nCompany; so that the owners not only lost their trees and what they\nmight obtain from them for their maintenance, but were also obliged\nto transport this timber and the laths, after they had been split,\nfrom their gardens for two or three miles to the harbours from which\nthey were to be shipped, either to the seacoast or to the banks of\nthe river.Besides this they had still to pay the tax fixed for those\ntrees in the Thombo.Moreover, it happened that in the year 1677\nthere was such a large demand for these planks and laths, not only\nin Colombo but also in Negapatam, that no less than 50,687 different\nstaves and 26,040 laths were sent to the latter town on account of\nthe Company.Their Excellencies at Batavia, considering that such\na practice was too tyrannical and not in keeping with the mild,\nreasonable, and just government which the Company wishes to carry on,\nhave lessened the burden of the inhabitants in this respect, and have\ndesired that in future no such demand should be made from them, but\nthat they should be allowed to sell this timber in the market.Further\nparticulars with regard to this matter may be found by Your Honours\nin the letter from Their Excellencies to Ceylon of May 13, 1692, and\nin the letter from His Excellency the Governor and the Council of\nColombo of April 29, 1695, which may serve for your guidance.This\nmay be considered as the fifth favour bestowed on the inhabitants,\nbut it does not extend to the palmyra planks and laths required by\nthe Company for the ordinary works in this Commandement or for the\nCastle.These are to be paid for at the rate stated in the Trade\nAccount as paid formerly, because this is a duty they have been\nsubject to from olden times, and it is unadvisable to depart from\nsuch customs without good reason, the nature of these people being\nsuch that they would not consider it a favour and be grateful for it,\nbut if they were relieved of this they would continue to complain\nof other matters.On the other hand they will, without complaint,\npay such duties as have been long customary, because", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "I therefore think it will be best to observe\nthe old customs.With regard to the purchase of planks and laths on\naccount of the Company, I found on my arrival from Batavia in this\nCommandement that this had been done with the greatest carelessness,\nthe accounts being in a terrible disorder.I therefore proposed in\nmy letter of December 9, 1694, to Colombo that such purchases should\nbe made by the Dessave, as he, by virtue of his office, has the best\nopportunity.This was approved of in the letter of the 22nd of the\nsame month, and since then a certain amount of cash, about Rds.100\nor 200, has been handed to him for this purpose, and he accounts for\nthis money in the Trade Accounts and states how many planks and laths\nhave been delivered to the Company.In this way it may be always seen\nhow the account stands, and this practice must be continued.It must\nalso be seen that as many planks and laths are stored up at the outer\nharbours for Coromandel and Trincomalee and at the inner harbours for\nColombo and our own use as will be possible without interfering with\nthe liberty granted to the inhabitants; because the demand both in\nNegapatam and in Colombo is still very great, as may be seen in the\nletter of February 10, 1695, to which I have referred.[22]\n\nThe felling of timber is a work that must receive particular attention,\nas this is required for the repair of the Company's vessels, at\nleast such parts of them as stand above the water level.For repairs\nunder water no timber has so far been obtained in the Wanni that is\nserviceable, as the timber there is liable to be attacked by a kind of\nworm under water.Timber can be transported to the Castle only once\na year during the rainy season, when the rivers swell so much that\nthe timber which has been felled during the dry season can be brought\ndown to the Passes and from there to the Fort.Sometimes also timber\nis felled near the seashore, when it is brought down along the coast\nto Kayts or Hammenhiel by pressed Carrias or fishermen.Occasionally\nsome timber is also felled near the seacoast between Manaar and\nJaffnapatam, which is suitable for door posts, window frames, and\nstocks for muskets and guns, while here also is found the timber for\ngun-carriages, which comes in very useful, as the Fort must be well\nprovided with ammunition.Laurens Pyl for\nthis Commandement, bearing date November 7, 1679, [36] it is stated\nin detail how the felling of timber is conducted and what class of\npeople are employed in this work.This subject is also dealt with\nin the report by the late Mr.Blom of August 20, 1692, so that I\nmerely refer to these documents, and recommend that another and an\nexperienced person ought to be trained for the supervision of this work\nin addition to the sergeant Harmen Claasz, who has done this work for\nthe last 25 years, and has gained much experience during his residence\nin the forests of the Wanni, and knows exactly when the timber ought\nto be felled, when it can be transported, and what kinds of trees are\nthe most suitable.Because it must be remembered that like all human\nbeings he also is only mortal.I therefore some time ago appointed the\nsoldier Laurens Hendriksz as his assistant.He is still employed in\nthe same capacity.As these forests are very malarious, there are but\nfew Dutchmen who could live there, and this is the more reason why Your\nHonours should always see that an able person is trained to the work,\nso as to avoid inconvenience some time or other.It is impossible to\nemploy a native in this work, because the Wannias would not have the\nsame regard for a native as for a European, and one of their caprices\nto which they are so often subject might interfere with the work.[23]\n\nCharcoal, made from the kernel of the palmyra fruit, is used here\nfor the smith's forge.In the Memoir referred to Your Honours will\nalso find stated by whom this is furnished to the Company.As I\nnoticed that the work in the smith's forge had to be discontinued\nsometimes for want of charcoal, especially during the months of\nAugust, September, and October, which causes great inconvenience to\nthe Government, I proposed to His Excellency the Governor and Council\nthat a quantity of smiths' coals from Holland should be provided.It must be used in times of scarcity, and the\npeople who are bound to collect and burn the kernel must be kept\nto their duty, and compelled to deliver up the full extent of their\ntax.The coals from Holland must be looked upon as a reserve supply,\nto be used only when no pannangay kernels are to be had, as happens\nsometimes when the inhabitants plant these seeds in order to obtain\nfrom them a kind of root, called calengen, which they use as food.[24]\n\nBark-lunt is another article which the Company receives from the\ninhabitants here without any expense.All inhabitants who go yearly\nto the Wanni to sow and mow, consisting of about 6,000 or 7,000\nand sometimes even 10,000 persons, and who pay 10 of these lunts to\nthe Wannias, have on their return at the Passes to pay a piece of\nlunt each, 4 fathoms long, and for each cow or bull they have with\nthem and have employed in the Wanni for ploughing or have allowed\nto graze there they also have to pay the same.This amounts to a\nconsiderable quantity yearly, nearly 60,000 lunts.It is a matter\nof little importance, but a great convenience, because not only the\ngarrison in this Commandement is thus furnished, but a large quantity\nmay also be sent to other places when required, as is done usually to\nNegapatam and Trincomalee, for which a charge of 1 stiver a piece is\nmade, which amount is entered here with the general income and charged\nto the said stations.Care must be taken that this duty is paid at\nthe Redoubts, but on the other hand also that not too much is charged\nto these people, because I have heard complaints that sometimes more\nthan 4 fathoms of the lunt is demanded.This is unfair, because the\nsurplus is appropriated by persons who have no right to it.[25]\n\nCoral stone, used for building purposes and for the burning of lime,\nis found here in abundance.This also the Company obtains without any\nexpenditure, because it is dug up and broken by ordinary Oeliares.It\nis also found at Point Pedro, where it is burnt into lime or otherwise\nsent to the Castle in tonys or pontoons, where it is then either burnt\ninto lime, used for foundations or for the filling up of the body of\nwalls, which are then covered on the outside with cut coral stone,\nas this makes them strong and durable.For some years the cut stone\nhas also been sent to Negapatam for the fortifications.This must be\ncontinued until we receive notice that it is no longer necessary,\nwhich I think will be soon, because I noticed that lately not so\nmuch stone was asked for.From 1687 up to the present about 52,950\ncut stones have been sent to this place.[26]\n\nIt may be understood from the above that lime is easily obtained here,\nand without great expenditure.That which is required for the Company\nhere is delivered free of charge.For the lime sent to Negapatam 7\nfanams are paid in place of 5 light stivers.[37] This is paid to the\nlime burners at Canganture, who received an advance on this account,\nof which a small balance is left.Meanwhile the Dessave de Bitter\ninformed us on his return from Coromandel that no more lime was\nrequired there, but in order that the Company may not lose by the\nadvance made, a quantity of 8,000 or 9,000 parras of lime is lying\nready at Canganture, which must be fetched by the Company's vessels\nin March or April and brought to Kayts.This, I think, will make up\nthe amount, and if not, they must reimburse the difference.It will\nbe seen from this that we have tried to comply with the wishes of\nHis late Excellency van Mydregt, who wrote from Negapatam on July 10,\n1687, that the new fortifications there were to be supplied with lime\nand all other building materials which are to be found here.The lime\nsent there since that date has amounted to 4,751 31/75 lasts.[27]\n\nThe dye-root is a product found in this territory which yields the\nCompany a considerable profit.The best kinds are found in Carrediva,\nbut the largest quantity in Manaar.The other kinds, found in the\nWanni and The Islands, are so inferior that they cannot be used for\ndyeing unless they are mixed with the kinds obtained from Manaar\nand Carrediva, and are found in small quantities only.The inferior\nkinds are used in this way so that they may not be lost, because it\nis to be feared that there will be a greater scarcity of root than\nof cloth.I will not enter into detail here as to how, by whom,\nwhere, and when these roots are dug out, or how they are employed\nin the dyeing of cloth, or again how much is received yearly; as\nall these matters have been mentioned at length on other occasions,\nmaking it unnecessary to do so here.I therefore refer Your Honours\nto an account by the late Commandeur Blom, dated April 25, 1693,\nwith regard to the cultivation and digging of this root, and another\nby the same Commandeur of November 12 of the same year with regard to\nthe dyeing of red cloth and the use of dye-root, while Your Honours\nmight also look up the document sent to Colombo on December 29, 1694,\nby Your Honours and myself, and another of September 16, 1695, where\nan estimate is made of the quantity of cloth that could be dyed here\nyearly with the root found in this Commandement.An answer will also\nbe found there to the question raised by the Honourable the Supreme\nGovernment of India in their letter to Ceylon of December 12, 1695,\nas to whether the dye-roots found in Java costing Rds.5 the picol\n[38] of 125 lb.and sent here might be employed with profit in the\nservice of the Company, and whether these roots from Java could not\nwith advantage be planted here.The reply from Colombo of January\n6, 1696, in answer to our letter of September 16, 1695, must also\nbe considered, in order that Your Honours may bear in mind all the\narguments that have been urged on this subject.Experiments have been\nmade with the Java roots to see whether they could be turned to any\naccount, and with a view to compare them with the Jaffna roots.It\nseems to me that good results may be obtained from the Brancoedoe\nroots, according to the experiments made by myself and afterwards by a\nCommittee in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies, but as\nwe cannot be quite sure yet another quantity of Java roots for further\nexperiments has been sent, as stated in the letter from Batavia of July\n3, 1696.Your Honours must pay great attention to these experiments,\nso that the result may be definitely known.This was prevented so\nfar by the rainy season.Besides the above-mentioned documents,\nYour Honours will also find useful information on the subject in two\nreports submitted by a Committee bearing date July 29 and December\n10, 1695.Experiments must also be made to find out whether the\nWancoedoe roots used either alone or mixed with the Jaffna roots will\nyield a good red dye of fast colour, this being the wish of Their\nExcellencies.Meantime the red cloth ordered in 1694, being 142 webs,\nand the 60 webs ordered lately, must be sent as soon as the required\nlinen arrives from Coromandel.This cloth must be carefully dyed, and\nafter being examined and approved by the members of Council must be\nproperly packed by the Pennisten of the Comptoiren who are employed\nin this work, on both which points complaints have been received,\nand which must be guarded against in future.During my residence\n96 webs of cloth have been sent out of the 142 that were ordered,\nso that 46 are yet to be sent, besides the 60 of the new order.No\nmore cloth and dye-roots must be issued to the dyers at a time than\nthey can use in one dyeing, because otherwise the cloth lies about in\ntheir poor dwellings and gets damaged, while the roots are stolen or\nused for private purposes, which is a loss to the Company, of which\nmany instances might be quoted.There is no doubt the Administrateur\nAbraham Mighielsz Biermans, who has been entrusted with the supervision\nof this work for many years, will endeavour to further the interests\nof the Company in this respect as much as possible and keep these lazy\npeople to their work.For the present there is a sufficient quantity\nof material in stock, as there were in the storehouses on the last\nof November, 1696, 60,106 lb.of different kinds of dye-root, with\nwhich a large quantity of cloth may be dyed, while a yearly supply is\ndelivered at the Fort from Manaar, Carrediva, &c. In Carrediva and \"the\nSeven Places\" as they are called, much less is delivered than formerly,\nbecause at present roots are dug up after the fields have been sown,\nwhile formerly this used to be done before the lands were cultivated,\nto the disadvantage of the owners.This practice was abandoned during\nthe time of Commandeur Blom, as it was considered unfair; because the\nfields are already heavily taxed, and on this account the delivery\nis 20 to 25 bharen [39] less than before.[28]\n\nThe farming out of the various duties in this Commandement may\nbe considered as the third source of revenue to the Company in\nJaffnapatam, and next to that of the sale of elephants and the revenue\nderived from the poll tax, land rents, tithes, Adigary, and Officie\nGelden mentioned before.The farming out of the said duties on the last\nof February, 1696, brought to the Company the sum of Rds.27,518 for\nthe period of one and a half year.The leases were extended on this\noccasion with a view to bring them to a close with the close of the\nTrade Accounts, which, in compliance with the latest instructions from\nBatavia, must be balanced on August 31.The previous year, from March\n1 to February 28, 1695-1696, the lease of the said duties amounted\nto Rds.15,641, which for 18 months would have been Rds.23,461 1/2,\nso that the Company received this year Rds.4,056 1/2 more than last\ntime; but I believe that the new duty on the import of foreign cloth\nhas largely contributed to this difference.This was proposed by me\non January 22, 1695, and approved by the Hon.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.the Supreme Government\nof India in their letter of December 12 of the same year.7,100, including the stamping of native cloth with\na seal at 25 per cent., while for the foreign cloth no more than 20\nper cent.As Their Excellencies considered this difference\nunfair, it has pleased them, at the earnest request of the natives,\nor rather at the request of the Majoraals on behalf of the natives, in\na later letter of July 3, 1696, to consent to the native cloth being\ntaxed at 20 per cent.only, which must be considered in connection\nwith the new lease.Meantime the order from Batavia contained in\nthe Resolutions of the Council of India of October 4, 1694, must be\nobserved, where all farmers are required to pay the monthly terms\nof their lease at the beginning of each month in advance.This rule\nhas been followed here, and it is expressly stipulated in the rent\nconditions.Whether the farming out of the duty on native and foreign\ncloth will amount to as much or more I cannot say; because I fear\nthat the present farmer has not made much profit by it, in consequence\nof the export having decreased on account of the closing of the free\npassage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa.The sale of these cloths depends\nlargely on the import of nely from the said places, and this having\nbeen prevented the sale necessarily decreased and consequently the\nfarmer made less profit.The passage having been re-opened, however,\nit may be expected that the sale will increase again.With a view\nto ascertain the exact value of this lease, I sent orders to all\nthe Passes on February 27, 1696, that a monthly list should be kept\nof how many stamped cloths are passed through and by whom, so that\nYour Honours will be able to see next August how much cloth has been\nexported by examining these lists, while you may also make an estimate\nof the quantity of cloth sold here without crossing the Passes, as\nthe farmer obtains his duty on these.Your Honours may further read\nwhat was reported on this subject from here to Colombo on December 16,\n1696, and the reply from Colombo of January 6 of this year.[29]\n\nThe Trade Accounts are closed now on August 31, as ordered by the\nSupreme Government of India in their letter of May 3, 1695.Last\nyear's account shows that in this Commandement the Company made a\nclear profit of Fl.It might have been greater if more\nelephants could have been obtained from the Wanni and Ponneryn, or if\nwe were allowed the profits on the elephants from Galle and Colombo\nsold here on behalf of the Company, which are not accompanied by an\ninvoice, but only by a simple acknowledgment.Another reason that it\nwas not higher is that we had to purchase the very expensive grain\nfrom Coromandel.Your Honours must also see that besides observing\nthis rule of closing the accounts in August, they are submitted to\nthe Council for examination, in order that it may be seen whether the\ndischarges are lawful and whether other matters are in agreement with\nthe instructions, and also whether some items could not be reduced\nin future, in compliance with the order passed by Resolution in the\nCouncil of India on September 6, 1694.These and all other orders\nsent here during the last two years must be strictly observed, such\nas the sending to Batavia of the old muskets, the river navigation\nof ships and sloops, the reduction of native weights and measures to\nDutch pounds, the carrying over of the old credits and debits into\nthe new accounts, the making and use of casks of a given measure,\nand the accounting for the new casks of meat, bacon, butter, and\nall such orders, which cannot be all mentioned here, but which Your\nHonours must look up now and again so as not to forget any and thus\nbe involved in difficulties.[(30)]\n\nThe debts due to the Company at the closing of the accounts must be\nentered in a separate memorandum, and submitted with the accounts.He stood at the door for a\nmoment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the\nchange her son's countenance had undergone.Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more\ndiscernment, exclaimed: \"Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!\"Mother,\" said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the\nsempstress,--\"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me\nyou will be calm.\"Mother Bunch was\nright--you are quite pale.\"and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her\nhands in his--\"you must--you do not know,--but--\"\n\nThe blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you\nterrify me!\"\"Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary,\" said Agricola, drying\nhis eyes--\"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command\nyour feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.\"\"Did I not say true, when I said he would come?\"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and\nemotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its\nbeating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and\nassisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a\ndistance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances\nchanged color more and more.\"Come, courage, mother,\" said the blacksmith; \"now the shock is over, you\nhave only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father.\"Oh, I cannot believe it,\"\nsaid Frances, bursting into tears.\"So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will\ntell you when you may see him.\"\"He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day.\"Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.\"\"He--he is--\" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to\napprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the\nsurprise might hurt you.\"\"And now,\" cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--\"he\nis there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely\nbeen able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy.\"And running\nto the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in\nprayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her\nprayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of\nthis scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of\nrespect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did\nnot dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained\nimpatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they\nunderstood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son\nexpressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who\nin the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the\ncreature for the Creator.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the\nkneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at\nthe thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure\ncorner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out\nof place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards\nher husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn\nsilence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but\na few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked\nup, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete\nenjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish\nand violent agitation.\"My children,\" said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the\norphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them\nwith astonishment, \"this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the\ndaughters of General Simon what I have been to them.\"\"Then, madame, you will treat us as your children,\" said Rose,\napproaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more\nastonished.\"Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some\ndifficulty; but I will tell you that by and by.\"One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!\"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as\nadmiration.\"Now--for us,\" cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and\nhis son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted\nonly to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young\nblacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his\nfrank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand\nagain, exclaiming, \"He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted\nlook he has!\"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but\nshe feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his\nson were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes\nfrom the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything\nso winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased\nher surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,\nMother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,\nunfortunately, the fire is out,\" said Frances, She tried to warm the\norphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to\nthe feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to\nmake herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the\ncupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small\npieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few\nembers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw\nand blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,\npresuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did\nall this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so\nforgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely\noccupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its\nwarmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the\ncoffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish\nDagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she\ncould lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her\nnotice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.there's Spoil-sport,\" said Dagobert, letting in his dog; \"he\nwants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too.\"The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After\nhaving rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet\nRose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they\ntook but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood\napart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular\nsaying, \"the friends of our friends are our friends,\" he went and licked\nthe hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By\na singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted\nher long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent\ndog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done\nall the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome\nflower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so\ndiscreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of\nmutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the\nrealities of life.\"Poor Frances,\" said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, \"you did\nnot expect such a pretty surprise!\"\"I am only sorry, my friend,\" replied Frances, \"that the daughters of\nGeneral Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for\nwith Agricola's garret--\"\n\n\"It composes our mansion,\" interrupted Dagobert; \"there are handsomer, it\nmust be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into\nnot being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm\nand arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and\nstraight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's\nfactory, to talk about business.\"\"To-morrow,\" said Agricola to Dagobert, \"you will not find at the factory\neither M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.\"cried Dagobert, hastily, \"the Marshal!\"\"To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the\ntitle and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny.\"cried Dagobert, with emotion, \"but that ought not to surprise\nme; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the\nleast they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my\nheart; it makes me jump again.\"Addressing the sisters, he said: \"Do you hear that, my children?You\narrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would\nhardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little\nduchesses!Ah, father Simon must have\nbeen very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!\"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his\nson again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends\nobtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,\nfor the last letter from India announced his departure.\"At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes\nfilled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we\nnot find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?\"\"Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established\nin the south; but we expect them back every day.\"that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to\ntalk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where\nto write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his\ngranddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children,\" added the\nsoldier, to Rose and Blanche, \"my good wife will give you her bed and you\nmust put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse\noff here than they were on the journey.\"\"You know we shall always be well off with you and madame,\" said Rose.\"Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,\nsince here we are to find our father,\" added Blanche.\"That hope gives you patience, I know,\" said Dagobert, \"but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my\nchildren.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,\nby any means.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it\nlooks.\"\"Besides,\" said Agricola, \"I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in\nParis will change it for you into a golden city.\"\"You are right, Agricola,\" said Rose, with a smile, \"you have, indeed,\nguessed us.\"\"Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and\nlatterly, too, with Gabriel,\" added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time.\"Yes,\" replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,\n\"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other\nthings, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,\nin his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of\nsaying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my\nbrave, brave wife!\"said Dagobert, with emotion, \"you did a good thing,\npoor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with\nyour own.\"\"Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.\"\"You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to\nyour account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow\nmorning.\"cried the blacksmith; \"who'll say, after\nthis, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to\nmeet him, father?\"\"I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if\nyou expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and\na fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is\naccustomed to sleep at the children's door.\"\"Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the\nyoung ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the\ncook-shop.\"\"No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.\"\"You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm\nyou a little, my dear young ladies,\" said Frances; \"unfortunately, I have\nnothing else to offer you.\"\"You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to\nbed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and\nBlanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give\nAgricola a respite.\"\"It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her,\" said Agricola.\"But I think she was here when my husband came in,\" added Frances.\"Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:\nshe is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "\"Go and see who it is, then, Agricola.\"Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with\na respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking\nfor a moment at Rose and Blanche.\"Allow me to observe, sir,\" said Agricola, \"that after knocking, you\nmight have waited till the door was opened, before you entered.\"Pray excuse me, sir,\" said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,\nperhaps to prolong his stay in the room: \"I beg a thousand pardons--I\nregret my intrusion--I am ashamed--\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to be, sir,\" said Agricola, with impatience, \"what do\nyou want?\"\"Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?\"\"No, sir; upstairs,\" said Agricola.\"Really, sir,\" cried the polite man, with low bows, \"I am quite abroad at\nmy blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought\nher proposals for work from a very respectable party.\"\"It is very late, sir,\" said Agricola, with surprise.\"But that young\nperson is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to\nnight; she is gone to bed.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.\"Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--\"\n\n\"Enough, sir,\" said Agricola, taking a step towards the door.\"I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be\nassured that--\"\n\n\"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse\nthe length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!\"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed\nhis moustache with pride.\"But that does not\nastonish you--you are used to it.\"During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again\ndirected a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and\nDagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground\nfor herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,\nassisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola\nhaving previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who\npreceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother\nBunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him\nrapidly, in a low tone:\n\n\"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you.\"These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did\nnot hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old\nsoldier said to him,\n\n\"Well, boy, what is it?\"\"Nothing, father,\" said the blacksmith, turning round; \"I feared I did\nnot light you well.\"\"Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to\nnight;\" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the\nlittle room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over\npolite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced\ntowards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak.\"The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances\nBaudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep\nwith her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will\nshare the young blacksmith's room.\"\"I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on\nthe subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to\nlearn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the\npost about the young blacksmith.\"And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's\nconfessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at\nRue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it\nis on a matter of great moment.\"\"All shall be faithfully executed,\" said the ceremonious man, cringing to\nRodin, as the coach drove quickly away.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described\nthe most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A\nflickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,\nbetrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy\nrecess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except\nby this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with\nthe roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so\nnearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be\nseated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl\nwas carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a\nlinen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple\ncalix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were\nfeebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who\nhad taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks\nwere downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one\nhand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened\nwith painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of\nAgricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,\nusually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion\nby which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a\nletter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by\npost in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the\nhousekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some\ntrivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his\nfamily.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly\nopened.she exclaimed, and Agricola immediately entered.\"I waited till my father went to sleep,\" said the blacksmith, in a low\nvoice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness.\"But\nwhat is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she\nhastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the\nlight, and read what follows:\n\n\"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the\nsisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of\nto-morrow.\"exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied\namazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his\neyes:-\"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared\nlibellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a\nsecret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as\nbeing concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy.\"said the girl, melting into tears, \"now I see it all.The man who\nwas lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,\ndoubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.My verses\nbreathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found\namong the papers of a secret society?\"Agricola disdainfully threw the\nletter upon the table.\"If you wish it,\" said Agricola, \"I will; no time is lost.\"He resumed the reading of the letter:\n\n\"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo\ndoubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be\nwell if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in\norder that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to\ntrial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,\nwhose sole support he is.\"A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown.\"After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance\nresumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: \"Reassure yourself, good\nMother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on\nme.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the\ntime.\"\"Agricola, for the love of heaven!\"said the girl, in a supplicating\ntone; \"treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and\nlisten to my advice.\"\"I tell you again, my good girl,\" replied Agricola, \"that it is two\nmonths since my song was published.It is not in any way political;\nindeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming\ndown on me.\"\"But,\" said the other, \"you forget that new events have arisen.It is\nscarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very\nneighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And,\" continued she, \"if the\nverses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the\npossession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more\nis necessary to compromise you in the plot.\"in which I only praise the\nlove of labor and of goodness!If so, justice\nwould be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be\nnecessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her\nsteps.\"\"Agricola,\" resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on\nhearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, \"I conjure you to listen to\nme!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you\ndo also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor\nlaborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;\nyou recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men;

Hardy for employer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.Say, Agricola, in these\ntimes of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than\nthat numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the\npersons who have been apprehended?\"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an\nexcellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view\nwith more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: \"And\nthen, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.\"\"Yes,\" resumed the sempstress; \"a letter of his, a letter in itself quite\ninsignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for\nconspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.\"\"That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and\nhe was set at liberty.\"\"Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has\nfurnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.He took up the\nletter and again read it attentively.\"And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?\"\"I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be\nnaturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,\nand poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them\nwithout you--without your labor!\"\"It would indeed be terrible,\" said Agricola, impatiently casting the\nletter upon the table.\"What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error\nthough it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without\nhearing him.\"\"But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards,\" said Mother Bunch,\nbitterly; \"and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his\ndaily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in\nprison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!\"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled.\"A month without work,\" he said, with a sad and thoughtful air.\"And my\nmother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family\nuntil the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!\"exclaimed the girl impetuously; \"suppose you apply to M.\nHardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,\nthat, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their\npersecution?\"\"Unfortunately,\" replied Agricola, \"M. Hardy is absent; he is on a\njourney with Marshal Simon.\"After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,\nadded: \"But no!After all, I had\nrather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my\ninnocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it\nbe that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my\nfamily will be equally prevented.\"that is true,\" said the poor girl; \"what is to be done!\"My brave father,\" said Agricola to himself, \"if this misfortune happen\nto-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep\nso joyously!\"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be\nrecollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue\ndes Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made\namong the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against\ndemocratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some\nseconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an\nindefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope.\"The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower\" (she\nshowed it to the blacksmith) \"who has known how to make reparation with\nso much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a\ngenerous heart.You must apply to her--\"\n\nWith these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort\nover herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in\nher life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman\nwas so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she\nidolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched.\"But what could be done\nwith this young lady?\"\"Did she not say to you,\" answered Mother Bunch, \"'Remember my name; and\nin all circumstances address yourself to me?'\"\"This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful\nconnections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to\nmorrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her\nsupport.\"\"But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?\"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had\nsaved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for\nhim.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your\ninnocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you\nwill have nothing more to fear.\"said Agricola, \"to ask so great a service from a person\nto whom one is almost unknown is hard.\"\"Believe me, Agricola,\" said the other sadly, \"I would never counsel what\ncould possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you\nunderstand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose\nthat you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety\nfor you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your\nemployment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,\nAgricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is\nnoble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is\ngenerous.The required surety will be\nas nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be\nthe very life to those who depend upon you.\"\"You are right, my good sister,\" said Agricola, with sadness and\ndejection.\"It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the\nyoung lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will\nindeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, \"I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I\nrendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?\"\"Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the\nservices which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust\nto me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is\ntrue, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any\nother person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am\nsure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far\nabove me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;\nyes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel\none; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that\nwhich I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly\nconsume myself with regrets.\"In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so\nheart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which\nthis unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,\nmade of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent\nyouth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,\nholding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,\n\"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and\ndelicacy!\"\"Unhappily,\" said the weeping girl, \"I can do nothing more than advise.\"\"And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those\nof a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over\ninto making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de\nCardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!\"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,\nthe sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely\nsweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally\ndevoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,\nthey sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the\nworld is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and\naffection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably\nblissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to\nhardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of\nthemselves.\"Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young\nlady's house?\"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope.\"And,\" she quickly added, \"at break of day I'll go down to watch at the\nstreet-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you\nof what I perceive.\"exclaimed Agricola, with increasing emotion.\"It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your\nfather,\" said the hunchback.\"The quarter in which the young lady dwells,\nis so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your\npresent concealment.\"\"I think I hear the voice of my father,\" said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and\nthe sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:\n\n\"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is\nover; and my tongue itches deucedly.\"said Mother Bunch; \"your absence would disquiet\nhim.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether\nor not I shall have seen anything suspicious.\"\"Why, Agricola, you are not here?\"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice.\"Here I am, father,\" said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's\napartment, and entering the garret, to his father.\"I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest\nits noise should disturb you.\"\"Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me,\" said Dagobert,\ngayly; \"it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my\ndear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not\nseen his son for eighteen years.\"\"Shall I light a candle, father?\"\"No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a\nnew pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be\nlike seeing you for the first time twice.\"The door of Agricola's garret\nbeing now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed\nnot an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in\norder that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite\nof her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to\nsink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the\nconversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom\nshe secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she\npossessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she\nloved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that\nshe should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found\nconsolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,\nshe rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order\nto see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear\nand cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's\ngarret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be\nseen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the\nsewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which\nAgricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a\nnail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the\npeople revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has\ndelighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their\nreverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had\nalready risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his\ninquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number\nof precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of\nAgricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the\ndisconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the\nyoung blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,\nsuspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the\nedge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had\ndressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both\nthose of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to\ndiscontinue the contemplation of his boy.\"You will laugh at me, my dear boy,\" said Dagobert to his son; \"but I\nwished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in\nfull day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear\nmoustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;\nhave you never had a wish to be a soldier?\"\"That's right,\" said Dagobert: \"and besides, I believe, after all, look\nye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good\nfor nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old\ncarbines, we have had our day.\"\"Yes; your days of heroism and of glory,\" said Agricola with excitement;\nand then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, \"it is\nsomething good and cheering to be your son!\"\"As to the good, I know nothing of that,\" replied Dagobert; \"but as for\nthe cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this\nis but the beginning!I am like the famished\nwretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and\nlittle that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to\nbe tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,\nI wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and\nperplexes me; and I am no longer myself.\"These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed\nthat they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was\nmenaced.\"Well,\" continued Dagobert; \"you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good\nto you.\"replied Agricola: \"there is none in the world better, or more\nequitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in\nhis factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies\nof Lucifer!\"\"You shall see,\" resumed Agricola, \"what welfare, what joy, what\naffection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;\nwho work with an ardent pleasure.\"This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician,\" said Dagobert.\"He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor\npleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,\nhe accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;\nwhence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that\nis not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in\nwhich all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful\nand salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an\nassociation.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!\"\"They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,\"\nobserved Dagobert.\"Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good\nmother!\"\"No, father, we will never separate again,\" said Agricola, stifling a\nsigh.\"My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have\nsuffered.\"exclaimed Dagobert, \"who the deuce has suffered?Look me well\nin the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You\nshall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in\nbeholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold\nfather and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You\nwill write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his\ngrand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should\nhasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which\nare of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down\nto say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.We will then\neat a morsel.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes\nto be regular at that: the good soul!no great harm, if it amuse her!and\nduring her absence, we will make a raid together.\"\"Father,\" said Agricola, with embarrassment, \"this morning it is out of\nmy power to accompany you.\"said Dagobert; \"recollect this is Monday!\"\"Yes, father,\" said Agricola, hesitatingly; \"but I have promised to\nattend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required\nin a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.\nHardy.\"That alters the case,\" said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret.\"I thought\nto make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must\nbe deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which\nsustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and\nspoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put\noff for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only\nhoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my\nAgricola!\"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his\nson's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one\nmoment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized.\"Now\nthat I have recovered myself,\" said Dagobert, laughing, \"let us speak of\nbusiness.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in\nParis?\"\"I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.\"\"My reason is,\" resumed Dagobert, \"that I sent from Russia by post, and\nby order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some\nimportant papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this\nnotary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his\naddress in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my\njourney; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,\nthat if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect\nit.\"Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He\ninvoluntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had\nnot perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: \"Come in!\"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed\nhat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,\nwere two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as\nthought.--\"My brother!\"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,\nwhile they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes\nbecome moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the\nyoung men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and\naspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola\ncontrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel.\"I was forewarned by my father of your arrival,\" said the blacksmith at\nlength.\"I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a\nhundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping\nfor it.\"asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands\nof Dagobert.\"I trust that you have found her in good health.\"replied Dagobert; \"and her health will have become a\nhundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting\nhis fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of\nineffable affection, Dagobert added:\n\n\"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel\nhas the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he\nsaved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine\nalso.\"suddenly exclaimed\nAgricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the\nmissionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly\nbeneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through\nwhich shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which\nextended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting\nevents which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near\nCardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with\nGabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the\nyoung missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,\nDagobert said:\n\n\"Aye, indeed!\"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!\"exclaimed the blacksmith, with\nrenewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest\nheld", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "\"Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!\"added Dagobert; \"who has\nwounded you thus?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.and in his turn, taking the other hand of the\nmissionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of\nwounds, and then added, \"In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken\ndown alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon\nwhich the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and\nagony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to\nthis upon your hand.\"\"It is evident that your hands\nhave been pierced through!and Agricola became\ngrievously agitated.\"Do not think about it,\" said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment\nof modesty.\"Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky\nMountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when\nProvidence snatched me from their hands.\"\"Unfortunate youth,\" said Dagobert; \"without arms then?You had not a\nsufficient escort for your protection?\"\"It is not for such as me to carry arms.\"said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;\n\"and we are never accompanied by any escort.\"\"Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it\nthat they did not defend you?\"exclaimed Dagobert,\nscarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own\nsense of hearing.\"The Christian faith,\" said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, \"cannot be\nimplanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion\nthat the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.\"\"Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in\nhim, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the\nblessings it offers to mankind.\"There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which\nwas uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism\nthus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now\ncontemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration\nand respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite\nunconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his\ntwo friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, \"What ails you?\"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:\n\"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to\nbe about as courageous as any man.\"Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there\" (the veteran took\nwith transport both of Gabriel's hands), \"that these wounds are as\nglorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by\nprofession!\"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,\nwith enthusiasm, \"Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their\nresignation!\"\"I entreat you not to extol me thus,\" said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have\ngone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under\nthe eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with\nme?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self\npreservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the\nshouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes\nof the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,\nwhich bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state\nthat I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every\none--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough\nhide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you\nnot a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,\nunarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those\nwhom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by\nartillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?\"cried Agricola, \"how noble of you to render to\nGabriel this justice!\"\"Oh, dear brother,\" said Gabriel, \"his kindness to me makes him magnify\nwhat was quite natural and simple!\"said the veteran soldier; \"yes, natural for gallants who have\nhearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.\"\"Oh, yes, very rare,\" said Agricola; \"for that kind of courage is the\nmost admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,\nalone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity\nand Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await\ndeath and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,\nwithout hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness\nissuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and\nthis in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your\nmagnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you\nwere rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black\nrobe!can you still contend that you are not\nas brave as he?\"\"And besides, too,\" resumed Dagobert, \"the dear boy did all that for a\nthankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never\nchange his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!\"\"I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be,\" said Gabriel to\nDagobert, smiling meekly.\"If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense\nawaits me on high.\"\"As to all that, my boy,\" said Dagobert, \"I do not understand it; and I\nwill not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would\nbe at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.\"\"But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like\nGabriel,\" said Agricola, \"and if you did know, dear father, how much\nvirtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood\ninsolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind\ndevotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who\nare inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly\nlawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their\nvocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand\nenfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we\nare, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your\nambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you\nunderstand the good that you could work within it.\"\"My desire is still the same,\" said Gabriel sadly: \"but unfortunately--\"\nand then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change\nthe conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: \"Believe me:\nbe more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your\ncourage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the\nspectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling\nheart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill.\"At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,\nlooked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, \"This is most\nsurprising!\"\"What Gabriel has just told us,\" replied Dagobert, \"brings to my mind\nwhat I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I\nadvanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night\nafter a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by\nnight,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our\npossession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of\nthe slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of\nmy old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has\nrestored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious\nwhirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,\n'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this\nfeeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following\nmorning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once\nmore to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm\nbecame weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my\nhorse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old\nsoldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, \"all generous hearts feel as you did during\nthe solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man\nis left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his\nbosom.\"\"And that should prove, my brave boy,\" rejoined Dagobert, \"that you are\ngreatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have\nnever abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the\nclaws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?\"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,\nthat the soldier said to him: \"If you ought not or cannot answer my\nrequest, let us say no more about it.\"\"I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother,\" replied\nthe missionary with altered voice.\"Only; it will be difficult for me to\nmake you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.\"\"Surely,\" said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, \"I must have been deceived\nby a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I\nawaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must\nhave been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has\nremained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I\nshould have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--\"\n\nDagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he\nalso had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had\nfreed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic.\"Of her who saved me,\" was the reply.\"A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?\"\"Yes,\" replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, \"a woman,\nyoung and beautiful!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the\ndistressed!'\"asked Dagobert, singularly\ninterested.\"'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied,\" answered\nthe missionary; \"and she departed, going towards the north of\nAmerica--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,\nwhere the nights are without end.\"\"As in Siberia,\" said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful.\"But,\" resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also\nto have become more and more absorbed, \"in what manner or by what means\ndid this woman come to your assistance?\"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was\nheard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the\nfears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted\nbrother.\"Agricola,\" said a sweet voice outside the door, \"I wish to\nspeak with you as soon as possible.\"The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But\nthe young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark\npassage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: \"Agricola, it is an hour\nsince broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have\nbeen watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing\nalarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure\nyou, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville.\"Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But\nI could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him.\"said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been\nstated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola.\"Yes,\" answered Agricola, \"for half an hour he has been with my father\nand me.\"\"What happiness I shall have in seeing him again,\" said the sewing-girl.\"He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your\nmother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young\nladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother\nhas requested me to give you this letter for your father.\"Well,\" resumed Mother Bunch, \"now that you have seen Gabriel, do not\ndelay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came\nto arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!\"\"You are right,\" said Agricola; \"it is indispensable that I should\ndepart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were\nforgotten.\"\"Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,\nperhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to\nyourself and us.\"a very few minutes more; and I'll come down.\"I'll come up\nagain to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,\nto resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his\ngarret.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.\"Dear father,\" he said to Dagobert, \"my mother has just received\nthis letter, and she requests you to read it.\"\"Very well; read it for me, my boy.\"And Agricola read as follows:\n\n\"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon\nwith an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your\nhusband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres\nwithout a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to\nno other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General\nSimon.\"DURAND, Notary at Chartres.\"Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, \"Who can\nhave told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?\"\"Perhaps, father,\" said Agricola, \"this is the notary to whom you\ntransmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.\"\"But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address\nwas Paris, not Chartres.And, besides,\" said the soldier, thoughtfully,\n\"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?\"\"It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as\npossible,\" said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would\nwithdraw his father for about two days, during which time his\n(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other.\"Your counsel is good,\" replied his father.\"Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it\nis not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is\nrequired on an affair of importance.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.In twice twenty-four hours I shall\nbe back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for\nChartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and\nGabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them\ncompany.\"\"That is, unfortunately, impossible,\" said the missionary, sadly.\"This\nvisit on my arrival is also a farewell visit.\"exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; \"surely it is not\npossible?\"\"I must answer no question upon this subject,\" said Gabriel, suppressing\na sigh: \"but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again\ninto this house.\"\"Why, my brave boy,\" resumed Dagobert with emotion, \"there is something\nin thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the\nshipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you\nenrolled under such a commander.\"exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of\nthe name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; \"was it in\nCardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?\"\"Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?\"\"Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?\"\"No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return\nthanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the\nperson to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.\"\"What a singular coincidence,\" thought Agricola, \"if the young lady\nshould be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!\"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made\nto Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; \"Dear father, excuse me; but it is\nalready late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock.\"This party is adjourned till my\nreturn from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself.\"Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the\nlatter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him\nto shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him\nsolemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished\nboth the blacksmith and the soldier: \"My dear brother, one word more.I\nhave come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall\nhave need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),\"\nadded Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; \"what is the matter?\"\"Yes,\" replied Gabriel, \"I need the advice and assistance of two men of\nhonor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I\nnot?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will\nyou come?\"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the\naccents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If\nhe should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,\nwhat could be done?\"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon\nus,\" said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--\"You have a father\nand a brother; make your own use of them.\"\"Thanks, thanks,\" said Gabriel, \"you set me quite at ease.\"\"I'll tell you what,\" resumed the soldier, \"were it not for your priest's\nrobe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,\nthat you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.\"\"Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and\nfearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A\nFATHER and A BROTHER!\"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually\nincreasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de\nCardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,\nin Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing\nthan the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with\nsmall squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre\neffect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which\nthe fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected\nin the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was\nsurmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which\nwas reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which\nan arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front\noverlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,\non this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,\nformed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great\nhabitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the\ngarden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a\nrotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its\nerection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the\nstones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of\nflowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de\nCardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a\nperistyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,\nlighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of\nsmaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or\ntransformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,\nthe black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the\nentire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built\nglistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect\ncontrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity\nof an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic\nclumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following\nthat of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in\nthe Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a\nneighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue\nsky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of\nverdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the\nrays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon\ntwo charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place\nin the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its\nown, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them\na young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that\nbreed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the\nperistyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the\nbeautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth\nyear.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a\nmore mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth\nmore white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or\nform smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,\nGeorgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,\nwith flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with\nrose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful\nfair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray\nlevantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large\ntuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a\nhollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,\nsurmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and\nflexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,\nallowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,\nreaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When\nGeorgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more\nquickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful\nankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in\nwhite silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish\nsatin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when\nvivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a\njoyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless\nfor the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had\nintroduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the\nHonorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint\nDizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak\nbut joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.She was\nnot much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,\nshone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her\nneck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery\ntan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her\nlarge eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that\nthey trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and\npetulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after\nthe happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon\nthe greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,\nwho advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly\nstopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in\nadvance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held\nherself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up\nof the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,\nthough of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy\nconsisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the\ncolor of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was\npot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;\nhe walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air\nof a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs\nsallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and\naltogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a\n\"church-goer's pug,\" answered to the name of \"My Lord.\"His mistress, a\nwoman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was\ndressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay\nand showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat\nof the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in\nher youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,\nwhich were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and\naustere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and\ndiscreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess\nSaint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two\nwomen present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even\nto the animals which attended them.There were similar differences\nbetween Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When\nthe latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a\nmovement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the\nyoung lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the\napparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,\nand even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the\ncur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of\ndistress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly\nsaid to Georgette:\n\n\"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog\nthus, and setting him upon mine.\"\"It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly\nanimal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky\nyesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,\nand brought her back to my mistress.However,\" continued Georgette, \"to\nwhat, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?\"\"I am commanded by the Princess,\" replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal\na smile of triumphant satisfaction, \"immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It\nregards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to\nherself.\"--\n\n\"A fair challenge, by Jove,\" cried the sentinel, turning round, \"and from\ntwo at once; but it's not easy to bang the soldier with his bandoleers;\"\nthen taking up the song where the damsel had stopt,\n\n\"To follow me ye weel may be glad, A share of my supper, a share of my\nbed, To the sound of the drum to range fearless and free, I'll gar ye be\nfain to follow me.\"--\n\n\"Come, my pretty lass, and kiss me for my song.\"\"I should not have thought of that, Mr Halliday,\" answered Jenny, with a\nlook and tone expressing just the necessary degree of contempt at the\nproposal, \"and, I'se assure ye, ye'll hae but little o' my company unless\nye show gentler havings--It wasna to hear that sort o'nonsense that\nbrought me here wi' my friend, and ye should think shame o' yoursell, 'at\nshould ye.\"and what sort of nonsense did bring you here then, Mrs Dennison?\"\"My kinswoman has some particular business with your prisoner, young Mr\nHarry Morton, and I am come wi' her to speak till him.\"answered the sentinel; \"and pray, Mrs Dennison, how\ndo your kinswoman and you propose to get in?You are rather too plump to\nwhisk through a keyhole, and opening the door is a thing not to be spoke\nof.\"\"It's no a thing to be spoken o', but a thing to be dune,\" replied the\npersevering damsel.\"We'll see about that, my bonny Jenny;\" and the soldier resumed his\nmarch, humming, as he walked to and fro along the gallery,\n\n\"Keek into the draw-well, Janet, Janet, Then ye'll see your bonny sell,\nMy joe Janet.\"\"So ye're no thinking to let us in, Mr Halliday?Weel, weel; gude e'en to\nyou--ye hae seen the last o' me, and o' this bonny die too,\" said Jenny,\nholding between her finger and thumb a splendid silver dollar.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.\"Give him gold, give him gold,\" whispered the agitated young lady.\"Silver's e'en ower gude for the like o' him,\" replied Jenny, \"that disna\ncare for the blink o' a bonny lassie's ee--and what's waur, he wad think\nthere was something mair in't than a kinswoman o' mine.siller's no sae plenty wi' us, let alane gowd.\"Having addressed this\nadvice aside to her mistress, she raised her voice, and said, \"My cousin\nwinna stay ony langer, Mr Halliday; sae, if ye please, gude e'en t'ye.\"\"Halt a bit, halt a bit,\" said the trooper; \"rein up and parley, Jenny.If I let your kinswoman in to speak to my prisoner, you must stay here\nand keep me company till she come out again, and then we'll all be well\npleased you know.\"\"The fiend be in my feet then,\" said Jenny; \"d'ye think my kinswoman and\nme are gaun to lose our gude name wi' cracking clavers wi' the like o'\nyou or your prisoner either, without somebody by to see fair play?Hegh,\nhegh, sirs, to see sic a difference between folk's promises and\nperformance!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.Ye were aye willing to slight puir Cuddie; but an I had\nasked him to oblige me in a thing, though it had been to cost his\nhanging, he wadna hae stude twice about it.\"retorted the dragoon, \"he'll be hanged in good earnest, I\nhope.I saw him today at Milnwood with his old puritanical b--of a\nmother, and if I had thought I was to have had him cast in my dish, I\nwould have brought him up at my horse's tail--we had law enough to bear\nus out.\"\"Very weel, very weel--See if Cuddie winna hae a lang shot at you ane o'\nthae days, if ye gar him tak the muir wi' sae mony honest folk.He can\nhit a mark brawly;

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\"Drinking and driving ower,\" quoth Jenny, \"wi' the Steward and John\nGudyill.\"\"So, so--he's safe enough--and where are my comrades?\"\"Birling the brown bowl wi' the fowler and the falconer, and some o' the\nserving folk.\"\"Sax gallons, as gude as e'er was masked,\" said the maid.\"Well, then, my pretty Jenny,\" said the relenting sentinel, \"they are\nfast till the hour of relieving guard, and perhaps something later; and\nso, if you will promise to come alone the next time\"--\"Maybe I will, and\nmaybe I winna,\" said Jenny; \"but if ye get the dollar, ye'll like that\njust as weel.\"\"I'll be d--n'd if I do,\" said Halliday, taking the money, howeve; \"but\nit's always something for my risk; for, if Claverhouse hears what I have\ndone, he will build me a horse as high as the Tower of Tillietudlem.But\nevery one in the regiment takes what they can come by; I am sure Bothwell\nand his blood-royal shows us a good example.And if I were trusting to\nyou, you little jilting devil, I should lose both pains and powder;\nwhereas this fellow,\" looking at the piece, \"will be good as far as he\ngoes.So, come, there is the door open for you; do not stay groaning and\npraying with the young whig now, but be ready, when I call at the door,\nto start, as if they were sounding 'Horse and away.'\"So speaking, Halliday unlocked the door of the closet, admitted Jenny and\nher pretended kinswoman, locked it behind them, and hastily reassumed the\nindifferent measured step and time-killing whistle of a sentinel upon his\nregular duty.The door, which slowly opened, discovered Morton with both arms reclined\nupon a table, and his head resting upon them in a posture of deep\ndejection.He raised his face as the door opened, and, perceiving the\nfemale figures which it admitted, started up in great surprise.Edith, as\nif modesty had quelled the courage which despair had bestowed, stood\nabout a yard from the door without having either the power to speak or to\nadvance.All the plans of aid, relief, or comfort, which she had proposed\nto lay before her lover, seemed at once to have vanished from her\nrecollection, and left only a painful chaos of ideas, with which was\nmingled a fear that she had degraded herself in the eyes of Morton by a\nstep which might appear precipitate and unfeminine.She hung motionless\nand almost powerless upon the arm of her attendant, who in vain\nendeavoured to reassure and inspire her with courage, by whispering, \"We\nare in now, madam, and we maun mak the best o' our time; for, doubtless,\nthe corporal or the sergeant will gang the rounds, and it wad be a pity\nto hae the poor lad Halliday punished for his civility.\"Morton, in the meantime, was timidly advancing, suspecting the truth; for\nwhat other female in the house, excepting Edith herself, was likely to\ntake an interest in his misfortunes?and yet afraid, owing to the\ndoubtful twilight and the muffled dress, of making some mistake which\nmight be prejudicial to the object of his affections.Jenny, whose ready\nwit and forward manners well qualified her for such an office, hastened\nto break the ice.\"Mr Morton, Miss Edith's very sorry for your present situation, and\"--\n\nIt was needless to say more; he was at her side, almost at her feet,\npressing her unresisting hands, and loading her with a profusion of\nthanks and gratitude which would be hardly intelligible from the mere\nbroken words, unless we could describe the tone, the gesture, the\nimpassioned and hurried indications of deep and tumultuous feeling, with\nwhich they were accompanied.For two or three minutes, Edith stood as motionless as the statue of a\nsaint which receives the adoration of a worshipper; and when she\nrecovered herself sufficiently to withdraw her hands from Henry's grasp,\nshe could at first only faintly articulate, \"I have taken a strange step,\nMr Morton--a step,\" she continued with more coherence, as her ideas\narranged themselves in consequence of a strong effort, \"that perhaps may\nexpose me to censure in your eyes--But I have long permitted you to use\nthe language of friendship--perhaps I might say more--too long to leave\nyou when the world seems to have left you.How, or why, is this\nimprisonment?can my uncle, who thinks so highly of\nyou--can your own kinsman, Milnwood, be of no use?\"Be what it will,\" answered Henry, contriving to make himself master of\nthe hand that had escaped from him, but which was now again abandoned to\nhis clasp, \"be what it will, it is to me from this moment the most\nwelcome incident of a weary life.To you, dearest Edith--forgive me, I\nshould have said Miss Bellenden, but misfortune claims strange\nprivileges--to you I have owed the few happy moments which have gilded a\ngloomy existence; and if I am now to lay it down, the recollection of\nthis honour will be my happiness in the last hour of suffering.\"\"Have you, who\nused to mix so little in these unhappy feuds, become so suddenly and\ndeeply implicated, that nothing short of\"--\n\nShe paused, unable to bring out the word which should have come next.\"Nothing short of my life, you would say?\"replied Morton, in a calm, but\nmelancholy tone; \"I believe that will be entirely in the bosoms of my\njudges.My guards spoke of a possibility of exchanging the penalty for\nentry into foreign service.I thought I could have embraced the\nalternative; and yet, Miss Bellenden, since I have seen you once more, I\nfeel that exile would be more galling than death.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.\"And is it then true,\" said Edith, \"that you have been so desperately\nrash as to entertain communication with any of those cruel wretches who\nassassinated the primate?\"\"I knew not even that such a crime had been committed,\" replied Morton,\n\"when I gave unhappily a night's lodging and concealment to one of those\nrash and cruel men, the ancient friend and comrade of my father.But my\nignorance will avail me little; for who, Miss Bellenden, save you, will\nbelieve it?And, what is worse, I am at least uncertain whether, even if\nI had known the crime, I could have brought my mind, under all the\ncircumstances, to refuse a temporary refuge to the fugitive.\"\"And by whom,\" said Edith, anxiously, \"or under what authority, will the\ninvestigation of your conduct take place?\"\"Under that of Colonel Grahame of Claverhouse, I am given to understand,\"\nsaid Morton; \"one of the military commission, to whom it has pleased our\nking, our privy council, and our parliament, that used to be more\ntenacious of our liberties, to commit the sole charge of our goods and of\nour lives.\"said Edith, faintly; \"merciful Heaven, you are lost ere\nyou are tried!He wrote to my grandmother that he was to be here\nto-morrow morning, on his road to the head of the county, where some\ndesperate men, animated by the presence of two or three of the actors in\nthe primate's murder, are said to have assembled for the purpose of\nmaking a stand against the government.His expressions made me shudder,\neven when I could not guess that--that--a friend\"--\n\n\"Do not be too much alarmed on my account, my dearest Edith,\" said Henry,\nas he supported her in his arms; \"Claverhouse, though stern and\nrelentless, is, by all accounts, brave, fair, and honourable.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.I am a\nsoldier's son, and will plead my cause like a soldier.He will perhaps\nlisten more favourably to a blunt and unvarnished defence than a\ntruckling and time-serving judge might do.And, indeed, in a time when\njustice is, in all its branches, so completely corrupted, I would rather\nlose my life by open military violence, than be conjured out of it by the\nhocus-pocus of some arbitrary lawyer, who lends the knowledge he has of\nthe statutes made for our protection, to wrest them to our destruction.\"\"You are lost--you are lost, if you are to plead your cause with\nClaverhouse!\"sighed Edith; \"root and branchwork is the mildest of his\nexpressions.The unhappy primate was his intimate friend and early\npatron.'No excuse, no subterfuge,' said his letter,'shall save either\nthose connected with the deed, or such as have given them countenance and\nshelter, from the ample and bitter penalty of the law, until I shall have\ntaken as many lives in vengeance of this atrocious murder, as the old man\nhad grey hairs upon his venerable head.'There is neither ruth nor favour\nto be found with him.\"Jenny Dennison, who had hitherto remained silent, now ventured, in the\nextremity of distress which the lovers felt, but for which they were\nunable to devise a remedy, to offer her own advice.\"Wi' your leddyship's pardon, Miss Edith, and young Mr Morton's, we\nmaunna waste time.Let Milnwood take my plaid and gown; I'll slip them\naff in the dark corner, if he'll promise no to look about, and he may\nwalk past Tam Halliday, who is half blind with his ale, and I can tell\nhim a canny way to get out o' the Tower, and your leddyship will gang\nquietly to your ain room, and I'll row mysell in his grey cloak, and pit\non his hat, and play the prisoner till the coast's clear, and then I'll\ncry in Tam Halliday, and gar him let me out.\"said Morton; \"they'll make your life answer it.\"\"Ne'er a bit,\" replied Jenny; \"Tam daurna tell he let ony body in, for\nhis ain sake; and I'll gar him find some other gate to account for the\nescape.\"said the sentinel, suddenly opening the door of the\napartment; \"if I am half blind, I am not deaf, and you should not plan an\nescape quite so loud, if you expect to go through with it.Come, come,\nMrs Janet--march, troop--quick time--trot, d--n me!--And you, madam\nkinswoman,--I won't ask your real name, though you were going to play me\nso rascally a trick,--but I must make a clear garrison; so beat a\nretreat, unless you would have me turn out the guard.\"\"I hope,\" said Morton, very anxiously, \"you will not mention this\ncircumstance, my good friend, and trust to my honour to acknowledge your\ncivility in keeping the secret.If you overheard our conversation, you\nmust have observed that we did not accept of, or enter into, the hasty\nproposal made by this good-natured girl.\"\"Oh, devilish good-natured, to be sure,\" said Halliday.\"As for the rest,\nI guess how it is, and I scorn to bear malice, or tell tales, as much as\nanother; but no thanks to that little jilting devil, Jenny Dennison, who\ndeserves a tight skelping for trying to lead an honest lad into a scrape,\njust because he was so silly as to like her good-for-little chit face.\"Jenny had no better means of justification than the last apology to which\nher sex trust, and usually not in vain; she pressed her handkerchief to\nher face, sobbed with great vehemence, and either wept, or managed, as\nHalliday might have said, to go through the motions wonderfully well.\"And now,\" continued the soldier, somewhat mollified, \"if you have any\nthing to say, say it in two minutes, and let me see your backs turned;\nfor if Bothwell take it into his drunken head to make the rounds half an\nhour too soon, it will be a black business to us all.\"\"Farewell, Edith,\" whispered Morton, assuming a firmness he was far from\npossessing; \"do not remain here--leave me to my fate--it cannot be beyond\nendurance since you are interested in it.--Good night, good night!--Do\nnot remain here till you are discovered.\"Thus saying, he resigned her to her attendant, by whom she was quietly\nled and partly supported out of the apartment.\"Every one has his taste, to be sure,\" said Halliday; \"but d--n me if I\nwould have vexed so sweet a girl as that is, for all the whigs that ever\nswore the Covenant.\"When Edith had regained her apartment, she gave way to a burst of grief\nwhich alarmed Jenny Dennison, who hastened to administer such scraps of\nconsolation as occurred to her.\"Dinna vex yoursell sae muckle, Miss Edith,\" said that faithful\nattendant; \"wha kens what may happen to help young Milnwood?He's a brave\nlad, and a bonny, and a gentleman of a good fortune, and they winna\nstring the like o' him up as they do the puir whig bodies that they catch\nin the muirs, like straps o' onions; maybe his uncle will bring him aff,\nor maybe your ain grand-uncle will speak a gude word for him--he's weel\nacquent wi' a' the red-coat gentlemen.\"you are right,\" said Edith, recovering herself\nfrom the stupor into which she had sunk; \"this is no time for despair,\nbut for exertion.You must find some one to ride this very night to my\nuncle's with a letter.\"It's unco late, and it's sax miles an' a bittock\ndoun the water; I doubt if we can find man and horse the night, mair\nespecially as they hae mounted a sentinel before the gate.he's gane, puir fallow, that wad hae dune aught in the warld I bade him,\nand ne'er asked a reason--an' I've had nae time to draw up wi' the new\npleugh-lad yet;

and he'll maybe no ken the way, though it's no sae difficult\nto hit, if he keep the horse-road, and mind the turn at the Cappercleugh,\nand dinna drown himsell in the Whomlekirn-pule, or fa' ower the scaur at\nthe Deil's Loaning, or miss ony o' the kittle steps at the Pass o'\nWalkwary, or be carried to the hills by the whigs, or be taen to the\ntolbooth by the red-coats.\"\"All ventures must be run,\" said Edith, cutting short the list of chances\nagainst Goose Gibbie's safe arrival at the end of his pilgrimage; \"all\nrisks must be run, unless you can find a better messenger.--Go, bid the\nboy get ready, and get him out of the Tower as secretly as you can.If he\nmeets any one, let him say he is carrying a letter to Major Bellenden of\nCharnwood, but without mentioning any names.\"\"I understand, madam,\" said Jenny Dennison; \"I warrant the callant will\ndo weel eneugh, and Tib the hen-wife will tak care o' the geese for a\nword o' my mouth; and I'll tell Gibbie your leddyship will mak his peace\nwi' Lady Margaret, and we'll gie him a dollar.\"\"Two, if he does his errand well,\" said Edith.Jenny departed to rouse Goose Gibbie out of his slumbers, to which he was\nusually consigned at sundown, or shortly after, he keeping the hours of\nthe birds under his charge.During her absence, Edith took her writing\nmaterials, and prepared against her return the following letter,\nsuperscribed, For the hands of Major Bellenden of Charnwood, my much\nhonoured uncle, These: \"My dear Uncle--This will serve to inform you I am\ndesirous to know how your gout is, as we did not see you at the\nwappen-schaw, which made both my grandmother and myself very uneasy.And\nif it will permit you to travel, we shall be happy to see you at our poor\nhouse to-morrow at the hour of breakfast, as Colonel Grahame of\nClaverhouse is to pass this way on his march, and we would willingly have\nyour assistance to receive and entertain a military man of such\ndistinction, who, probably, will not be much delighted with the company\nof women.Also, my dear uncle, I pray you to let Mrs Carefor't, your\nhousekeeper, send me my double-trimmed paduasoy with the hanging sleeves,\nwhich she will find in the third drawer of the walnut press in the green\nroom, which you are so kind as to call mine.Also, my dear uncle, I pray\nyou to send me the second volume of the Grand Cyrus, as I have only read\nas far as the imprisonment of Philidaspes upon the seven hundredth and\nthirty-third page; but, above all, I entreat you to come to us to-morrow\nbefore eight of the clock, which, as your pacing nag is so good, you may\nwell do without rising before your usual hour.So, praying to God to\npreserve your health, I rest your dutiful and loving niece,\n\n\"Edith Bellenden.A party of soldiers have last night brought your friend,\nyoung Mr Henry Morton of Milnwood, hither as a prisoner.I conclude you\nwill be sorry for the young gentleman, and, therefore, let you know this,\nin case you may think of speaking to Colonel Grahame in his behalf.I\nhave not mentioned his name to my grandmother, knowing her prejudice\nagainst the family.\"This epistle being duly sealed and delivered to Jenny, that faithful\nconfidant hastened to put the same in the charge of Goose Gibbie, whom\nshe found in readiness to start from the castle.She then gave him\nvarious instructions touching the road, which she apprehended he was\nlikely to mistake, not having travelled it above five or six times, and\npossessing only the same slender proportion of memory as of judgment.Lastly, she smuggled him out of the garrison through the pantry window\ninto the branchy yew-tree which grew close beside it, and had the\nsatisfaction to see him reach the bottom in safety, and take the right\nturn at the commencement of his journey.She then returned to persuade\nher young mistress to go to bed, and to lull her to rest, if possible,\nwith assurances of Gibbie's success in his embassy, only qualified by a\npassing regret that the trusty Cuddie, with whom the commission might\nhave been more safely reposed, was no longer within reach of serving her.More fortunate as a messenger than as a cavalier, it was Gibbie's good\nhap rather than his good management, which, after he had gone astray not\noftener than nine times, and given his garments a taste of the variation\nof each bog, brook, and slough, between Tillietudlem and Charnwood,\nplaced him about daybreak before the gate of Major Bellenden's mansion,\nhaving completed a walk of ten miles (for the bittock, as usual, amounted\nto four) in little more than the same number of hours.At last comes the troop, by the word of command\n               Drawn up in our court, where the Captain cries,\n               Stand!Swift\n\nMajor Bellenden's ancient valet, Gideon Pike as he adjusted his master's\nclothes by his bedside, preparatory to the worthy veteran's toilet,\nacquainted him, as an apology for disturbing him an hour earlier than his\nusual time of rising, that there was an express from Tillietudlem.said the old gentleman, rising hastily in his bed,\nand sitting bolt upright,--\"Open the shutters, Pike--I hope my\nsister-in-law is well--furl up the bed-curtain.--What have we all here?\"why, she knows I have not had a\nfit since Candlemas.--The wappen-schaw?I told her a month since I was\nnot to be there.--Paduasoy and hanging sleeves?why, hang the gipsy\nherself!--Grand Cyrus and Philipdastus?--Philip Devil!--is the wench gone\ncrazy all at once?was it worth while to send an express and wake me\nat five in the morning for all this trash?--But what says her\npostscriptum?--Mercy on us!\"he exclaimed on perusing it,--\"Pike, saddle\nold Kilsythe instantly, and another horse for yourself.\"\"I hope nae ill news frae the Tower, sir?\"said Pike, astonished at his\nmaster's sudden emotion.\"Yes--no--yes--that is, I must meet Claverhouse there on some express\nbusiness; so boot and saddle, Pike, as fast as you can.--O, Lord!what\ntimes are these!--the poor lad--my old cronie's son!--and the silly wench\nsticks it into her postscriptum, as she calls it, at the tail of all this\ntrumpery about old gowns and new romances!\"In a few minutes the good old officer was fully equipped; and having\nmounted upon his arm-gaunt charger as soberly as Mark Antony himself\ncould have done, he paced forth his way to the Tower of Tillietudlem.On the road he formed the prudent resolution to say nothing to the old\nlady (whose dislike to presbyterians of all kinds he knew to be\ninveterate) of the quality and rank of the prisoner detained within her\nwalls, but to try his own influence with Claverhouse to obtain Morton's\nliberation.\"Being so loyal as he is, he must do something for so old a cavalier as I\nam,\" said the veteran to himself; \"and if he is so good a soldier as the\nworld speaks of, why, he will be glad to serve an old soldier's son.I\nnever knew a real soldier that was not a frank-hearted, honest fellow;\nand I think the execution of the laws (though it's a pity they find it\nnecessary to make them so severe) may be a thousand times better\nintrusted with them than with peddling lawyers and thick-skulled country\ngentlemen.\"Such were the ruminations of Major Miles Bellenden, which were terminated\nby John Gudyill (not more than half-drunk) taking hold of his bridle, and\nassisting him to dismount in the roughpaved court of Tillietudlem.\"Why, John,\" said the veteran, \"what devil of a discipline is this you\nhave been keeping?You have been reading Geneva print this morning\nalready.\"\"I have been reading the Litany,\" said John, shaking his head with a look\nof drunken gravity, and having only caught one word of the Major's\naddress to him; \"life is short, sir; we are flowers of the field,\nsir--hiccup--and lilies of the valley.\"Why, man, such carles as thou and I can hardly be\ncalled better than old hemlocks, decayed nettles, or withered rag-weed;\nbut I suppose you think that we are still worth watering.\"\"I am an old soldier, sir, I thank Heaven--hiccup\"--\n\n\"An old skinker, you mean, John.But come, never mind, show me the way to\nyour mistress, old lad.\"John Gudyill led the way to the stone hall, where Lady Margaret was\nfidgeting about, superintending, arranging, and re-forming the\npreparations made for the reception of the celebrated Claverhouse, whom\none party honoured and extolled as a hero, and another execrated as a\nbloodthirsty oppressor.\"Did I not tell you,\" said Lady Margaret to her principal female\nattendant--\"did I not tell you, Mysie, that it was my especial pleasure\non this occasion to have every thing in the precise order wherein it was\nupon that famous morning when his most sacred majesty partook of his\ndisjune at Tillietudlem?\"\"Doubtless, such were your leddyship's commands, and to the best of my\nremembrance\"--was Mysie answering, when her ladyship broke in with, \"Then\nwherefore is the venison pasty placed on the left side of the throne, and\nthe stoup of claret upon the right, when ye may right weel remember,\nMysie, that his most sacred majesty with his ain hand shifted the pasty\nto the same side with the flagon, and said they were too good friends to\nbe parted?\"\"I mind that weel, madam,\" said Mysie; \"and if I had forgot, I have heard\nyour leddyship often speak about that grand morning sin' syne; but I\nthought every thing was to be placed just as it was when his majesty, God\nbless him, came into this room, looking mair like an angel than a man, if\nhe hadna been sae black-a-vised.\"\"Then ye thought nonsense, Mysie; for in whatever way his most sacred\nmajesty ordered the position of the trenchers and flagons, that, as weel\nas his royal pleasure in greater matters, should be a law to his\nsubjects, and shall ever be to those of the house of Tillietudlem.\"\"Weel, madam,\" said Mysie, making the alterations required, \"it's easy\nmending the error; but if every thing is just to be as his majesty left\nit, there should be an unco hole in the venison pasty.\"\"Who is that, John Gudyill?\"\"I can speak to no\none just now.--Is it you, my dear brother?\"she continued, in some\nsurprise, as the Major entered; \"this is a right early visit.\"\"Not more early than welcome, I hope,\" replied Major Bellenden, as he\nsaluted the widow of his deceased brother; \"but I heard by a note which\nEdith sent to Charnwood about some of her equipage and books, that you\nwere to have Claver'se here this morning, so I thought, like an old\nfirelock as I am, that I should like to have a chat with this rising\nsoldier.I caused Pike saddle Kilsythe, and here we both are.\"\"And most kindly welcome you are,\" said the old lady; \"it is just what I\nshould have prayed you to do, if I had thought there was time.All is to be in the same order as when\"--\"The\nking breakfasted at Tillietudlem,\" said the Major, who, like all Lady\nMargaret's friends, dreaded the commencement of that narrative, and was\ndesirous to cut it short,--\"I remember it well; you know I was waiting on\nhis majesty.\"\"You were, brother,\" said Lady Margaret; \"and perhaps you can help me to\nremember the order of the entertainment.\"\"Nay, good sooth,\" said the Major, \"the damnable dinner that Noll gave us\nat Worcester a few days afterwards drove all your good cheer out of my\nmemory.--But how's this?--you have even the great Turkey-leather\nelbow-chair, with the tapestry cushions, placed in state.\"\"The throne, brother, if you please,\" said Lady Margaret, gravely.\"Well, the throne be it, then,\" continued the Major.\"Is that to be\nClaver'se's post in the attack upon the pasty?\"\"No, brother,\" said the lady; \"as these cushions have been once honoured\nby accommodating the person of our most sacred Monarch, they shall never,\nplease Heaven, during my life-time, be pressed by any less dignified\nweight.\"\"You should not then,\" said the old soldier, \"put them in the way of an\nhonest old cavalier, who has ridden ten miles before breakfast; for, to\nconfess the truth, they look very inviting.\"On the battlements of the warder's turret,\" answered the old lady,\n\"looking out for the approach of our guests.\"\"Why, I'll go there too; and so should you, Lady Margaret, as soon as you\nhave your line of battle properly formed in the hall here.It's a pretty\nthing, I can tell you, to see a regiment of horse upon the march.\"Thus speaking, he offered his arm with an air of old-fashioned gallantry,\nwhich Lady Margaret accepted with such a courtesy of acknowledgment as\nladies were wont to make in Holyroodhouse before the year 1642, which,\nfor one while, drove both courtesies and courts out of fashion.Upon the bartizan of the turret, to which they ascended by many a winding\npassage and uncouth staircase, they found Edith, not in the attitude of a\nyoung lady who watches with fluttering curiosity the approach of a smart\nregiment of dragoons, but pale, downcast, and evincing, by her\ncountenance, that sleep had not, during the preceding night, been the\ncompanion of her pillow.The good old veteran was hurt at her appearance,\nwhich, in the hurry of preparation, her grandmother had omitted to\nnotice.\"What is come over you, you silly girl?\"he said; \"why, you look like an\nofficer's wife when she opens the News-letter after an action, and\nexpects to find her husband among the killed and wounded.But I know the\nreason--you will persist in reading these nonsensical romances, day and\nnight, and whimpering for distresses that never existed.Why, how the\ndevil can you believe that Artamines, or what d'ye call him, fought\nsinglehanded with a whole battalion?One to three is as great odds as\never fought and won, and I never knew any body that cared to take that,\nexcept old Corporal Raddlebanes.But these d--d books put all pretty\nmen's actions out of countenance.I daresay you would think very little\nof Raddlebanes, if he were alongside of Artamines.--I would have the\nfellows that write such nonsense brought to the picquet for\nleasing-making.\"[Note:  Romances of the Seventeenth Century.As few, in the present\n     age, are acquainted with the ponderous folios to which the age of\n     Louis XIV.gave rise, we need only say, that they combine the\n     dulness of the metaphysical courtship with all the improbabilities\n     of the ancient Romance of Chivalry.Their character will be most\n     easily learned from Boileau's Dramatic Satire, or Mrs Lennox's\n     Female Quixote.]Lady Margaret, herself somewhat attached to the perusal of romances, took\nup the cudgels.\"Monsieur Scuderi,\" she said, \"is a soldier, brother;\nand, as I have heard, a complete one, and so is the Sieur d'Urfe.\"\"More shame for them; they should have known better what they were\nwriting about.For my part, I have not read a book these twenty years\nexcept my Bible, The Whole Duty of Man, and, of late days, Turner's\nPallas Armata, or Treatise on the Ordering of the Pike Exercise, and I\ndon't like his discipline much neither.Sir James Turner was a soldier of fortune,\n     bred in the civil wars.He was intrusted with a commission to levy\n     the fines imposed by the Privy Council for non-conformity, in the\n     district of Dumfries and Galloway.In this capacity he vexed the\n     country so much by his exactions, that the people rose and made him\n     prisoner, and then proceeded in arms towards Mid-Lothian, where they\n     were defeated at Pentland Hills, in 1666.Besides his treatise on\n     the Military Art, Sir James Turner wrote several other works; the\n     most curious of which is his Memoirs of his own Life and Times,\n     which has just been printed, under the charge of the Bannatyne\n     Club.]He wants to draw up the cavalry in front of a stand of pikes, instead of\nbeing upon the wings.Sure am I, if we had done so at Kilsythe, instead\nof having our handful of horse on the flanks, the first discharge would\nhave sent them back among our Highlanders.--But I hear the kettle-drums.\"All heads were now bent from the battlements of the turret, which\ncommanded a distant prospect down the vale of the river.The Tower of\nTillietudlem stood, or perhaps yet stands, upon the angle of a very\nprecipitous bank, formed by the junction of a considerable brook with the\nClyde.[Note: The Castle of Tillietudlem is imaginary; but the ruins of\n     Craignethan Castle, situated on the Nethan, about three miles from\n     its junction with the Clyde, have something of the character of the\n     description in the text].There was a narrow bridge of one steep arch, across the brook near its\nmouth, over which, and along the foot of the high and broken bank, winded\nthe public road; and the fortalice, thus commanding both bridge and pass,\nhad been, in times of war, a post of considerable importance, the\npossession of which was necessary to secure the communication of the\nupper and wilder districts of the country with those beneath, where the\nvalley expands, and", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "The view downwards is\nof a grand woodland character; but the level ground and gentle <DW72>s\nnear the river form cultivated fields of an irregular shape, interspersed\nwith hedgerow-trees and copses, the enclosures seeming to have been\nindividually cleared out of the forest which surrounds them, and which\noccupies, in unbroken masses, the steeper declivities and more distant\nbanks.The stream, in colour a clear and sparkling brown, like the hue of\nthe Cairngorm pebbles, rushes through this romantic region in bold sweeps\nand curves, partly visible and partly concealed by the trees which clothe\nits banks.With a providence unknown in other parts of Scotland, the\npeasants have, in most places, planted orchards around their cottages,\nand the general blossom of the appletrees at this season of the year gave\nall the lower part of the view the appearance of a flower-garden.Looking up the river, the character of the scene was varied considerably\nfor the worse.A hilly, waste, and uncultivated country approached close\nto the banks; the trees were few, and limited to the neighbourhood of the\nstream, and the rude moors swelled at a little distance into shapeless\nand heavy hills, which were again surmounted in their turn by a range of\nlofty mountains, dimly seen on the horizon.Thus the tower commanded two\nprospects, the one richly cultivated and highly adorned, the other\nexhibiting the monotonous and dreary character of a wild and inhospitable\nmoorland.The eyes of the spectators on the present occasion were attracted to the\ndownward view, not alone by its superior beauty, but because the distant\nsounds of military music began to be heard from the public high-road\nwhich winded up the vale, and announced the approach of the expected body\nof cavalry.Their glimmering ranks were shortly afterwards seen in the\ndistance, appearing and disappearing as the trees and the windings of the\nroad permitted them to be visible, and distinguished chiefly by the\nflashes of light which their arms occasionally reflected against the sun.The train was long and imposing, for there were about two hundred and\nfifty horse upon the march, and the glancing of the swords and waving of\ntheir banners, joined to the clang of their trumpets and kettle-drums,\nhad at once a lively and awful effect upon the imagination.As they\nadvanced still nearer and nearer, they could distinctly see the files of\nthose chosen troops following each other in long succession, completely\nequipped and superbly mounted.\"It's a sight that makes me thirty years younger,\" said the old cavalier;\n\"and yet I do not much like the service that these poor fellows are to be\nengaged in.Although I had my share of the civil war, I cannot say I had\never so much real pleasure in that sort of service as when I was employed\non the Continent, and we were hacking at fellows with foreign faces and\noutlandish dialect.It's a hard thing to hear a hamely Scotch tongue cry\nquarter, and be obliged to cut him down just the same as if he called out\n_misricorde_.--So, there they come through the Netherwood haugh; upon my\nword, fine-looking fellows, and capitally mounted.--He that is gallopping\nfrom the rear of the column must be Claver'se himself;--ay, he gets into\nthe front as they cross the bridge, and now they will be with us in less\nthan five minutes.\"[Illustration: Edith on the Battlements--frontispiece]\n\n\nAt the bridge beneath the tower the cavalry divided, and the greater\npart, moving up the left bank of the brook and crossing at a ford a\nlittle above, took the road of the Grange, as it was called, a large set\nof farm-offices belonging to the Tower, where Lady Margaret had ordered\npreparation to be made for their reception and suitable entertainment.The officers alone, with their colours and an escort to guard them, were\nseen to take the steep road up to the gate of the Tower, appearing by\nintervals as they gained the ascent, and again hidden by projections of\nthe bank and of the huge old trees with which it is covered.When they\nemerged from this narrow path, they found themselves in front of the old\nTower, the gates of which were hospitably open for their reception.Lady\nMargaret, with Edith and her brother-in-law, having hastily descended\nfrom their post of observation, appeared to meet and to welcome their\nguests, with a retinue of domestics in as good order as the orgies of the\npreceding evening permitted.The gallant young cornet (a relation as well\nas namesake of Claverhouse, with whom the reader has been already made\nacquainted) lowered the standard amid the fanfare of the trumpets, in\nhomage to the rank of Lady Margaret and the charms of her grand-daughter,\nand the old walls echoed to the flourish of the instruments, and the\nstamp and neigh of the chargers.[Note:  John Grahame of Claverhouse.This remarkable person united\n     the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a\n     disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of\n     the rights of his fellow-subjects.He was the unscrupulous agent of\n     the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of\n     the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he\n     asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the\n     military skill with which he supported it at the battle of\n     Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.It is said by tradition, that he was very desirous to see, and be\n     introduced to, a certain Lady Elphinstoun, who had reached the\n     advanced age of one hundred years and upwards.The noble matron,\n     being a stanch whig, was rather unwilling to receive Claver'se, (as\n     he was called from his title,) but at length consented.After the\n     usual compliments, the officer observed to the lady, that having\n     lived so much beyond the usual term of humanity, she must in her\n     time have seen many strange changes.\"Hout na, sir,\" said Lady\n     Elphinstoun, \"the world is just to end with me as it began.When I\n     was entering life, there was ane Knox deaving us a' wi' his clavers,\n     and now I am ganging out, there is ane Claver'se deaving us a' wi'\n     his knocks.\"Clavers signifying, in common parlance, idle chat, the double pun\n     does credit to the ingenuity of a lady of a hundred years old.]Claverhouse himself alighted from a black horse, the most beautiful\nperhaps in Scotland.He had not a single white hair upon his whole body,\na circumstance which, joined to his spirit and fleetness, and to his\nbeing so frequently employed in pursuit of the presbyterian recusants,\ncaused an opinion to prevail among them, that the steed had been\npresented to his rider by the great Enemy of Mankind, in order to assist\nhim in persecuting the fugitive wanderers.When Claverhouse had paid his\nrespects to the ladies with military politeness, had apologized for the\ntrouble to which he was putting Lady Margaret's family, and had received\nthe corresponding assurances that she could not think any thing an\ninconvenience which brought within the walls of Tillietudlem so\ndistinguished a soldier, and so loyal a servant of his sacred majesty;\nwhen, in short, all forms of hospitable and polite ritual had been duly\ncomplied with, the Colonel requested permission to receive the report of\nBothwell, who was now in attendance, and with whom he spoke apart for a\nfew minutes.Major Bellenden took that opportunity to say to his niece,\nwithout the hearing of her grandmother, \"What a trifling foolish girl you\nare, Edith, to send me by express a letter crammed with nonsense about\nbooks and gowns, and to slide the only thing I cared a marvedie about\ninto the postscript!\"\"I did not know,\" said Edith, hesitating very much, \"whether it would be\nquite--quite proper for me to\"--\"I know what you would say--whether it\nwould be right to take any interest in a presbyterian.But I knew this\nlad's father well.He was a brave soldier; and, if he was once wrong, he\nwas once right too.I must commend your caution, Edith, for having said\nnothing of this young gentleman's affair to your grandmother--you may\nrely on it I shall not--I will take an opportunity to speak to Claver'se.Come, my love, they are going to breakfast.Their breakfast so warm to be sure they did eat,\n               A custom in travellers mighty discreet.The breakfast of Lady Margaret Bellenden no more resembled a modern\n_dejune_, than the great stone-hall at Tillietudlem could brook\ncomparison with a modern drawing-room.No tea, no coffee, no variety of\nrolls, but solid and substantial viands,--the priestly ham, the knightly\nsirloin, the noble baron of beef, the princely venison pasty; while\nsilver flagons, saved with difficulty from the claws of the Covenanters,\nnow mantled, some with ale, some with mead, and some with generous wine\nof various qualities and descriptions.The appetites of the guests were\nin correspondence to the magnificence and solidity of the preparation--no\npiddling--no boy's-play, but that steady and persevering exercise of the\njaws which is best learned by early morning hours, and by occasional hard\ncommons.Lady Margaret beheld with delight the cates which she had provided\ndescending with such alacrity into the persons of her honoured guests,\nand had little occasion to exercise, with respect to any of the company\nsaving Claverhouse himself, the compulsory urgency of pressing to eat, to\nwhich, as to the peine forte et dure, the ladies of that period were in\nthe custom of subjecting their guests.But the leader himself, more anxious to pay courtesy to Miss Bellenden,\nnext whom he was placed, than to gratify his appetite, appeared somewhat\nnegligent of the good cheer set before him.Edith heard, without reply,\nmany courtly speeches addressed to her, in a tone of voice of that happy\nmodulation which could alike melt in the low tones of interesting\nconversation, and rise amid the din of battle, \"loud as a trumpet with a\nsilver sound.\"The sense that she was in the presence of the dreadful\nchief upon whose fiat the fate of Henry Morton must depend--the\nrecollection of the terror and awe which were attached to the very name\nof the commander, deprived her for some time, not only of the courage to\nanswer, but even of the power of looking upon him.But when, emboldened\nby the soothing tones of his voice, she lifted her eyes to frame some\nreply, the person on whom she looked bore, in his appearance at least,\nnone of the terrible attributes in which her apprehensions had arrayed\nhim.Grahame of Claverhouse was in the prime of life, rather low of stature,\nand slightly, though elegantly, formed; his gesture, language, and\nmanners, were those of one whose life had been spent among the noble and\nthe gay.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.An oval face, a\nstraight and well-formed nose, dark hazel eyes, a complexion just\nsufficiently tinged with brown to save it from the charge of effeminacy,\na short upper lip, curved upward like that of a Grecian statue, and\nslightly shaded by small mustachios of light brown, joined to a profusion\nof long curled locks of the same colour, which fell down on each side of\nhis face, contributed to form such a countenance as limners love to paint\nand ladies to look upon.The severity of his character, as well as the higher attributes of\nundaunted and enterprising valour which even his enemies were compelled\nto admit, lay concealed under an exterior which seemed adapted to the\ncourt or the saloon rather than to the field.The same gentleness and\ngaiety of expression which reigned in his features seemed to inspire his\nactions and gestures; and, on the whole, he was generally esteemed, at\nfirst sight, rather qualified to be the votary of pleasure than of\nambition.But under this soft exterior was hidden a spirit unbounded in\ndaring and in aspiring, yet cautious and prudent as that of Machiavel\nhimself.Profound in politics, and embued, of course, with that disregard\nfor individual rights which its intrigues usually generate, this leader\nwas cool and collected in danger, fierce and ardent in pursuing success,\ncareless of facing death himself, and ruthless in inflicting it upon\nothers.Such are the characters formed in times of civil discord, when\nthe highest qualities, perverted by party spirit, and inflamed by\nhabitual opposition, are too often combined with vices and excesses which\ndeprive them at once of their merit and of their lustre.In endeavouring to reply to the polite trifles with which Claverhouse\naccosted her, Edith showed so much confusion, that her grandmother\nthought it necessary to come to her relief.\"Edith Bellenden,\" said the old lady, \"has, from my retired mode of\nliving, seen so little of those of her own sphere, that truly she can\nhardly frame her speech to suitable answers.A soldier is so rare a sight\nwith us, Colonel Grahame, that unless it be my young Lord Evandale, we\nhave hardly had an opportunity of receiving a gentleman in uniform.And,\nnow I talk of that excellent young nobleman, may I enquire if I was not\nto have had the honour of seeing him this morning with the regiment?\"\"Lord Evandale, madam, was on his march with us,\" answered the leader,\n\"but I was obliged to detach him with a small party to disperse a\nconventicle of those troublesome scoundrels, who have had the impudence\nto assemble within five miles of my head-quarters.\"said the old lady; \"that is a height of presumption to which I\nwould have thought no rebellious fanatics would have ventured to aspire.There is an evil spirit in the land, Colonel\nGrahame, that excites the vassals of persons of rank to rebel against the\nvery house that holds and feeds them.There was one of my able-bodied men\nthe other day who plainly refused to attend the wappen-schaw at my\nbidding.Is there no law for such recusancy, Colonel Grahame?\"\"I think I could find one,\" said Claverhouse, with great composure, \"if\nyour ladyship will inform me of the name and residence of the culprit.\"\"His name,\" said Lady Margaret, \"is Cuthbert Headrigg; I can say nothing\nof his domicile, for ye may weel believe, Colonel Grahame, he did not\ndwell long in Tillietudlem, but was speedily expelled for his contumacy.I wish the lad no severe bodily injury; but incarceration, or even a few\nstripes, would be a good example in this neighbourhood.His mother, under\nwhose influence I doubt he acted, is an ancient domestic of this family,\nwhich makes me incline to mercy; although,\" continued the old lady,\nlooking towards the pictures of her husband and her sons, with which the\nwall was hung, and heaving, at the same time, a deep sigh, \"I, Colonel\nGrahame, have in my ain person but little right to compassionate that\nstubborn and rebellious generation.They have made me a childless widow,\nand, but for the protection of our sacred sovereign and his gallant\nsoldiers, they would soon deprive me of lands and goods, of hearth and\naltar.Seven of my tenants, whose joint rent-mail may mount to wellnigh a\nhundred merks, have already refused to pay either cess or rent, and had\nthe assurance to tell my steward that they would acknowledge neither king\nnor landlord but who should have taken the Covenant.\"\"I will take a course with them--that is, with your ladyship's\npermission,\" answered Claverhouse; \"it would ill become me to neglect the\nsupport of lawful authority when it is lodged in such worthy hands as\nthose of Lady Margaret Bellenden.But I must needs say this country grows\nworse and worse daily, and reduces me to the necessity of taking measures\nwith the recusants that are much more consonant with my duty than with my\ninclinations.And, speaking of this, I must not forget that I have to\nthank your ladyship for the hospitality you have been pleased to extend\nto a party of mine who have brought in a prisoner, charged with having\nresetted [Note: Resetted, i.e.the murdering\nvillain, Balfour of Burley.\"\"The house of Tillietudlem,\" answered the lady, \"hath ever been open to\nthe servants of his majesty, and I hope that the stones of it will no\nlonger rest on each other when it surceases to be as much at their\ncommand as at ours.And this reminds me, Colonel Grahame, that the\ngentleman who commands the party can hardly be said to be in his proper\nplace in the army, considering whose blood flows in his veins; and if I\nmight flatter myself that any thing would be granted to my request, I\nwould presume to entreat that he might be promoted on some favourable\nopportunity.\"\"Your ladyship means Sergeant Francis Stewart, whom we call Bothwell?\"\"The truth is, he is a little too rough in the\ncountry, and has not been uniformly so amenable to discipline as the\nrules of the service require.But to instruct me how to oblige Lady\nMargaret Bellenden, is to lay down the law to me.--Bothwell,\" he\ncontinued, addressing the sergeant, who just then appeared at the door,\n\"go kiss Lady Margaret Bellenden's hand, who interests herself in your\npromotion, and you shall have a commission the first vacancy.\"Bothwell went through the salutation in the manner prescribed, but not\nwithout evident marks of haughty reluctance, and, when he had done so,\nsaid aloud, \"To kiss a lady's hand can never disgrace a gentleman; but I\nwould not kiss a man's, save the king's, to be made a general.\"\"You hear him,\" said Claverhouse, smiling, \"there's the rock he splits\nupon; he cannot forget his pedigree.\"\"I know, my noble colonel,\" said Bothwell, in the same tone, \"that you\nwill not forget your promise; and then, perhaps, you may permit Cornet\nStewart to have some recollection of his grandfather, though the Sergeant\nmust forget him.\"\"Enough of this, sir,\" said Claverhouse, in the tone of command which was\nfamiliar to him; \"and let me know what you came to report to me just\nnow.\"\"My Lord Evandale and his party have halted on the high-road with some\nprisoners,\" said Bothwell.\"Surely, Colonel Grahame, you\nwill permit him to honour me with his society, and to take his poor\ndisjune here, especially considering, that even his most sacred Majesty\ndid not pass the Tower of Tillietudlem without halting to partake of some\nrefreshment.\"As this was the third time in the course of the conversation that Lady\nMargaret had adverted to this distinguished event, Colonel Grahame, as\nspeedily as politeness would permit, took advantage of the first pause to\ninterrupt the farther progress of the narrative, by saying, \"We are\nalready too numerous a party of guests; but as I know what Lord Evandale\nwill suffer (looking towards Edith) if deprived of the pleasure which we\nenjoy, I will run the risk of overburdening your ladyship's\nhospitality.--Bothwell, let Lord Evandale know that Lady Margaret\nBellenden requests the honour of his company.\"\"And let Harrison take care,\" added Lady Margaret, \"that the people and\ntheir horses are suitably seen to.\"Edith's heart sprung to her lips during this conversation; for it\ninstantly occurred to her, that, through her influence over Lord\nEvandale, she might find some means of releasing Morton from his present\nstate of danger, in case her uncle's intercession with Claverhouse should\nprove ineffectual.At any other time she would have been much averse to\nexert this influence; for, however inexperienced in the world, her native\ndelicacy taught her the advantage which a beautiful young woman gives to\na young man when she permits him to lay her under an obligation.And she\nwould have been the farther disinclined to request any favour of Lord\nEvandale, because the voice of the gossips in Clydesdale had, for reasons\nhereafter to be made known, assigned him to her as a suitor, and because\nshe could not disguise from herself that very little encouragement was\nnecessary to realize conjectures which had hitherto no foundation.This\nwas the more to be dreaded, that, in the case of Lord Evandale's making a\nformal declaration, he had every chance of being supported by the\ninfluence of Lady Margaret and her other friends, and that she would have\nnothing to oppose to their solicitations and authority, except a\npredilection, to avow which she knew would be equally dangerous and\nunavailing.She determined, therefore, to wait the issue of her uncle's\nintercession, and, should it fail, which she conjectured she should soon\nlearn, either from the looks or language of the open-hearted veteran, she\nwould then, as a last effort, make use in Morton's favour of her interest\nwith Lord Evandale.Her mind did not long remain in suspense on the\nsubject of her uncle's application.Major Bellenden, who had done the honours of the table, laughing and\nchatting with the military guests who were at that end of the board, was\nnow, by the conclusion of the repast, at liberty to leave his station,\nand accordingly took an opportunity to approach Claverhouse, requesting\nfrom his niece, at the same time, the honour of a particular\nintroduction.As his name and character were well known, the two military\nmen met with expressions of mutual regard; and Edith, with a beating\nheart, saw her aged relative withdraw from the company, together with his\nnew acquaintance, into a recess formed by one of the arched windows of\nthe hall.She watched their conference with eyes almost dazzled by the\neagerness of suspense, and, with observation rendered more acute by the\ninternal agony of her mind, could guess, from the pantomimic gestures\nwhich accompanied the conversation, the progress and fate of the\nintercession in behalf of Henry Morton.The first expression of the countenance of Claverhouse betokened that\nopen and willing courtesy, which, ere it requires to know the nature of\nthe favour asked, seems to say, how happy the party will be to confer an\nobligation on the suppliant.But as the conversation proceeded, the brow\nof that officer became darker and more severe, and his features, though\nstill retaining the expression of the most perfect politeness, assumed,\nat least to Edith's terrified imagination, a harsh and inexorable\ncharacter.His lip was now compressed as if with impatience; now curled\nslightly upward, as if in civil contempt of the arguments urged by Major\nBellenden.The language of her uncle, as far as expressed in his manner,\nappeared to be that of earnest intercession, urged with all the\naffectionate simplicity of his character, as well as with the weight\nwhich his age and reputation entitled him to use.But it seemed to have\nlittle impression upon Colonel Grahame, who soon changed his posture, as\nif about to cut short the Major's importunity, and to break up their\nconference with a courtly expression of regret, calculated to accompany a\npositive refusal of the request solicited.This movement brought them so\nnear Edith, that she could distinctly hear Claverhouse say, \"It cannot\nbe, Major Bellenden; lenity, in his case, is altogether beyond the bounds\nof my commission, though in any thing else I am heartily desirous to\noblige you.--And here comes Evandale with news, as I think.--What tidings\ndo you bring us, Evandale?\"he continued, addressing the young lord, who\nnow entered in complete uniform, but with his dress disordered, and his\nboots spattered, as if by riding hard.[Illustration: Claverhouse--176]\n\n\n\"Unpleasant news, sir,\" was his reply.\"A large body of whigs are in arms\namong the hills, and have broken out into actual rebellion.They have\npublicly burnt the Act of Supremacy, that which established episcopacy,\nthat for observing the martyrdom of Charles I., and some others, and have\ndeclared their intention to remain together in arms for furthering the\ncovenanted work of reformation.\"This unexpected intelligence struck a sudden and painful surprise into\nthe minds of all who heard it, excepting Claverhouse.replied Colonel Grahame, his dark eyes\nflashing fire, \"they are the best I have heard these six months.Now that\nthe scoundrels are drawn into a body, we will make short work with them.When the adder crawls into daylight,\" he added, striking the heel of his\nboot upon the floor, as if in the act of crushing a noxious reptile, \"I\ncan trample him to death; he is only safe when he remains lurking in his\nden or morass.--Where are these knaves?\"he continued, addressing Lord\nEvandale.\"About ten miles off among the mountains, at a place called Loudon-hill,\"\nwas the young nobleman's reply.\"I dispersed the conventicle against\nwhich you sent me, and made prisoner an old trumpeter of rebellion,--an\nintercommuned minister, that is to say,--who was in the act of exhorting\nhis hearers to rise and be doing in the good cause, as well as one or two\nof his hearers who seemed to be particularly insolent; and from some\ncountry people and scouts I learned what I now tell you.\"\"Probably a thousand men, but accounts differ widely.\"\"Then,\" said Claverhouse, \"it is time for us to be up and be doing\nalso--Bothwell, bid them sound to horse.\"Bothwell, who, like the war-horse of scripture, snuffed the battle afar\noff, hastened to give orders to six <DW64>s, in white dresses richly\nlaced, and having massive silver collars and armlets.These sable\nfunctionaries acted as trumpeters, and speedily made the castle and the\nwoods around it ring with their summons.said Lady Margaret, her heart sinking under\nrecollection of former unhappy times; \"had ye not better send to learn\nthe force of the rebels?--O, how many a fair face hae I heard these\nfearfu' sounds call away frae the Tower of Tillietudlem, that my auld een\nwere ne'er to see return to it!\"\"It is impossible for me to stop,\" said Claverhouse; \"there are rogues\nenough in this country to make the rebels five times their strength, if\nthey are not checked at once.\"\"Many,\" said Evandale, \"are flocking to them already, and they give out\nthat they expect a strong body of the indulged presbyterians, headed by\nyoung Milnwood, as they call him, the son of the famous old roundhead,\nColonel Silas Morton.\"This speech produced a very different effect upon the hearers.Edith\nalmost sunk from her seat with terror, while Claverhouse darted a glance\nof sarcastic triumph at Major Bellenden, which seemed to imply--\"You see\nwhat are the principles of the young man you are pleading for.\"\"It's a lie--it's a d--d lie of these rascally fanatics,\" said the Major\nhastily.\"I will answer for Henry Morton as I would for my own son.He is\na lad of as good church-principles as any gentleman in the Life-Guards.He has gone to church service with me fifty\ntimes, and I never heard him miss one of the responses in my life.Edith\nBellenden can bear witness to it as well as I. He always read on the same\nPrayer-book with her, and could look out the lessons as well as the\ncurate himself.Call him up; let him be heard for himself.\"\"There can be no harm in that,\" said Claverhouse, \"whether he be innocent\nor guilty.--Major Allan,\" he said, turning to the officer next in\ncommand, \"take a guide, and lead the regiment forward to Loudon-hill by\nthe best and shortest road.Move steadily, and do not let the men blow\nthe horses; Lord Evandale and I will overtake you in a quarter of an\nhour.Leave Bothwell with a party to bring up the prisoners.\"Allan bowed, and left the apartment, with all the officers, excepting\nClaverhouse and the young nobleman.In a few minutes the sound of the\nmilitary music and the clashing of hoofs announced that the horsemen were\nleaving the castle.The sounds were presently heard only at intervals,\nand soon died away entirely.While Claverhouse endeavoured to soothe the terrors of Lady Margaret, and\nto reconcile the veteran Major to his opinion of Morton, Evandale,\ngetting the better of that conscious shyness which renders an ingenuous\nyouth diffident in approaching the object of his affections, drew near to\nMiss Bellenden, and accosted her in a tone of mingled respect and\ninterest.\"We are to leave you,\" he said, taking her hand, which he pressed with\nmuch emotion--\"to leave you for a scene which is not without its dangers.Farewell, dear Miss Bellenden;--let me say for the first, and perhaps the\nlast time, dear Edith!We part in circumstances so singular as may excuse\nsome solemnity in bidding farewell to one, whom I have known so long, and\nwhom I--respect so highly.\"The manner differing from the words, seemed to express a feeling much\ndeeper and more agitating than was conveyed in the phrase he made use of.It was not in woman to be utterly insensible to his modest and deep-felt\nexpression of tenderness.Although borne down by the misfortunes and\nimminent danger of the man she loved, Edith was touched by the hopeless\nand reverential passion of the gallant youth, who now took leave of her\nto rush into dangers of no ordinary description.\"I hope--I sincerely trust,\" she said, \"there is no danger.I hope there\nis no occasion for this solemn ceremonial--that these hasty insurgents\nwill be dispersed rather by fear than force, and that Lord Evandale will\nspeedily return to be what he must always be, the dear and valued friend\nof all in this castle.\"\"Of all,\" he repeated, with a melancholy emphasis upon the word.\"But be\nit so--whatever is near you is dear and valued to me, and I value their\napprobation accordingly.Of our success I am not sanguine.Our numbers\nare so few, that I dare not hope for so speedy, so bloodless, or so safe\nan end of this unhappy disturbance.These men are enthusiastic, resolute,\nand desperate, and have leaders not altogether unskilled in military\nmatters.I cannot help thinking that the impetuosity of our Colonel is\nhurrying us against them rather prematurely.But there are few that have\nless reason to shun danger than I have.\"Edith had now the opportunity she wished to bespeak the young nobleman's\nintercession and protection for Henry Morton, and it seemed the only\nremaining channel of interest by which he could be rescued from impending\ndestruction.Yet she felt at that moment as if, in doing so, she was\nabusing the partiality and confidence of the lover, whose heart was as\nopen before her, as if his tongue had made an express declaration.Could\nshe with honour engage Lord Evandale in the service of a rival?or could\nshe with prudence make him any request, or lay herself under any\nobligation to him, without affording ground for hopes which she could\nnever realize?But the moment was too urgent for hesitation, or even for\nthose explanations with which her request might otherwise have been\nqualified.\"I will but dispose of this young fellow,\" said Claverhouse, from the\nother side of the hall, \"and then, Lord Evandale--I am sorry to interrupt\nagain your conversation--but then we must mount.--Bothwell, why do not\nyou bring up the prisoner?and, hark ye, let two files load their\ncarabines.\"In these words, Edith conceived she heard the death-warrant of her lover.She instantly broke through the restraint which had hitherto kept her\nsilent.\"My Lord Evandale,\" she said, \"this young gentleman is a particular\nfriend of my uncle's--your interest must be great with your colonel--let\nme request your intercession in his favour--it will confer on my uncle a\nlasting obligation.\"\"You overrate my interest, Miss Bellenden,\" said Lord Evandale; \"I have\nbeen often unsuccessful in such applications, when I have made them on\nthe mere score of humanity.\"\"Yet try once again for my uncle's sake.\"\"Will you not allow me to\nthink I am obliging you personally in this matter?--Are you so diffident\nof an old friend that you will not allow him even the satisfaction of\nthinking that he is gratifying your wishes?\"\"Surely--surely,\" replied Edith; \"you will oblige me infinitely--I am\ninterested in the young gentleman on my uncle's account--Lose no time,\nfor God's sake!\"She became bolder and more urgent in her entreaties, for she heard the\nsteps of the soldiers who were entering with their prisoner.then,\" said Evandale, \"he shall not die, if I should die in\nhis place!--But will not you,\" he said, resuming the hand, which in the\nhurry of her spirits she had not courage to withdraw, \"will not you grant\nme one suit, in return for my zeal in your service?\"\"Any thing you can ask, my Lord Evandale, that sisterly affection can\ngive.\"\"And is this all,\" he continued, \"all you can grant to my affection\nliving, or my memory when dead?\"\"Do not speak thus, my lord,\" said Edith, \"you distress me, and do\ninjustice to yourself.There is no friend I esteem more highly, or to\nwhom I would more readily grant every mark of regard--providing--But\"--A\ndeep sigh made her turn her head suddenly, ere she had well uttered the", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "As their eyes\nmet each other, the sad and reproachful expression of Morton's glance\nseemed to imply that he had partially heard, and altogether\nmisinterpreted, the conversation which had just passed.There wanted but\nthis to complete Edith's distress and confusion.Her blood, which rushed\nto her brow, made a sudden revulsion to her heart, and left her as pale\nas death.This change did not escape the attention of Evandale, whose\nquick glance easily discovered that there was between the prisoner and\nthe object of his own attachment, some singular and uncommon connexion.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.He resigned the hand of Miss Bellenden, again surveyed the prisoner with\nmore attention, again looked at Edith, and plainly observed the confusion\nwhich she could no longer conceal.\"This,\" he said, after a moment's gloomy silence, \"is, I believe, the\nyoung gentleman who gained the prize at the shooting match.\"\"I am not sure,\" hesitated Edith--\"yet--I rather think not,\" scarce\nknowing what she replied.\"It is he,\" said Evandale, decidedly; \"I know him well.A victor,\" he\ncontinued, somewhat haughtily, \"ought to have interested a fair spectator\nmore deeply.\"He then turned from Edith, and advancing towards the table at which\nClaverhouse now placed himself, stood at a little distance, resting on\nhis sheathed broadsword, a silent, but not an unconcerned, spectator of\nthat which passed.To explain the deep effect which the few broken passages of the\nconversation we have detailed made upon the unfortunate prisoner by whom\nthey were overheard, it is necessary to say something of his previous\nstate of mind, and of the origin of his acquaintance with Edith.Henry Morton was one of those gifted characters, which possess a force of\ntalent unsuspected by the owner himself.He had inherited from his father\nan undaunted courage, and a firm and uncompromising detestation of\noppression, whether in politics or religion.But his enthusiasm was\nunsullied by fanatic zeal, and unleavened by the sourness of the\npuritanical spirit.From these his mind had been freed, partly by the\nactive exertions of his own excellent understanding, partly by frequent\nand long visits at Major Bellenden's, where he had an opportunity of\nmeeting with many guests whose conversation taught him, that goodness and\nworth were not limited to those of any single form of religious\nobservance.The base parsimony of his uncle had thrown many obstacles in the way of\nhis education; but he had so far improved the opportunities which offered\nthemselves, that his instructors as well as his friends were surprised at\nhis progress under such disadvantages.Still, however, the current of his\nsoul was frozen by a sense of dependence, of poverty, above all, of an\nimperfect and limited education.These feelings impressed him with a\ndiffidence and reserve which effectually concealed from all but very\nintimate friends, the extent of talent and the firmness of character,\nwhich we have stated him to be possessed of.The circumstances of the\ntimes had added to this reserve an air of indecision and of indifference;\nfor, being attached to neither of the factions which divided the kingdom,\nhe passed for dull, insensible, and uninfluenced by the feeling of\nreligion or of patriotism.No conclusion, however, could be more unjust;\nand the reasons of the neutrality which he had hitherto professed had\nroot in very different and most praiseworthy motives.He had formed few\ncongenial ties with those who were the objects of persecution, and was\ndisgusted alike by their narrow-minded and selfish party-spirit, their\ngloomy fanaticism, their abhorrent condemnation of all elegant studies or\ninnocent exercises, and the envenomed rancour of their political hatred.But his mind was still more revolted by the tyrannical and oppressive\nconduct of the government, the misrule, license, and brutality of the\nsoldiery, the executions on the scaffold, the slaughters in the open\nfield, the free quarters and exactions imposed by military law, which\nplaced the lives and fortunes of a free people on a level with Asiatic\nslaves.Condemning, therefore, each party as its excesses fell under his\neyes, disgusted with the sight of evils which he had no means of\nalleviating, and hearing alternate complaints and exultations with which\nhe could not sympathize, he would long ere this have left Scotland, had\nit not been for his attachment to Edith Bellenden.The earlier meetings of these young people had been at Charnwood, when\nMajor Bellenden, who was as free from suspicion on such occasions as\nUncle Toby himself, had encouraged their keeping each other constant\ncompany, without entertaining any apprehension of the natural\nconsequences.Love, as usual in such cases, borrowed the name of\nfriendship, used her language, and claimed her privileges.When Edith\nBellenden was recalled to her mother's castle, it was astonishing by what\nsingular and recurring accidents she often met young Morton in her\nsequestered walks, especially considering the distance of their places of\nabode.Yet it somehow happened that she never expressed the surprise\nwhich the frequency of these rencontres ought naturally to have excited,\nand that their intercourse assumed gradually a more delicate character,\nand their meetings began to wear the air of appointments.Books,\ndrawings, letters, were exchanged between them, and every trifling\ncommission, given or executed, gave rise to a new correspondence.Love\nindeed was not yet mentioned between them by name, but each knew the\nsituation of their own bosom, and could not but guess at that of the\nother.Unable to desist from an intercourse which possessed such charms\nfor both, yet trembling for its too probable consequences, it had been\ncontinued without specific explanation until now, when fate appeared to\nhave taken the conclusion into its own hands.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.It followed, as a consequence of this state of things, as well as of the\ndiffidence of Morton's disposition at this period, that his confidence in\nEdith's return of his affection had its occasional cold fits.Her\nsituations was in every respect so superior to his own, her worth so\neminent, her accomplishments so many, her face so beautiful, and her\nmanners so bewitching, that he could not but entertain fears that some\nsuitor more favoured than himself by fortune, and more acceptable to\nEdith's family than he durst hope to be, might step in between him and\nthe object of his affections.Common rumour had raised up such a rival in\nLord Evandale, whom birth, fortune, connexions, and political principles,\nas well as his frequent visits at Tillietudlem, and his attendance upon\nLady Bellenden and her niece at all public places, naturally pointed out\nas a candidate for her favour.It frequently and inevitably happened,\nthat engagements to which Lord Evandale was a party, interfered with the\nmeeting of the lovers, and Henry could not but mark that Edith either\nstudiously avoided speaking of the young nobleman, or did so with obvious\nreserve and hesitation.These symptoms, which, in fact, arose from the delicacy of her own\nfeelings towards Morton himself, were misconstrued by his diffident\ntemper, and the jealousy which they excited was fermented by the\noccasional observations of Jenny Dennison.This true-bred serving-damsel\nwas, in her own person, a complete country coquette, and when she had no\nopportunity of teasing her own lovers, used to take some occasional\nopportunity to torment her young lady's.This arose from no ill-will to\nHenry Morton, who, both on her mistress's account and his own handsome\nform and countenance, stood high in her esteem.But then Lord Evandale\nwas also handsome; he was liberal far beyond what Morton's means could\nafford, and he was a lord, moreover, and, if Miss Edith Bellenden should\naccept his hand, she would become a baron's lady, and, what was more,\nlittle Jenny Dennison, whom the awful housekeeper at Tillietudlem huffed\nabout at her pleasure, would be then Mrs Dennison, Lady Evandale's own\nwoman, or perhaps her ladyship's lady-in-waiting.That these may\nbe made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half\nof this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half\nleft in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is\nentirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected\nby Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds\nof trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually\nneglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental\nwood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of\ncomparatively little value.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared\nfor exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a\nspecimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches\nin length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The\nspecimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might\nbe transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of\na box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city\nwithout change.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a\nportion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The\ntrunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of\ntreatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an\nirregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves\nspringing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated\ntrees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,\nand though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang\nout, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was\nsupposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when\nthe workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new\nlife, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the\notherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again\nbefore the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the\nDouglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided\ncuriosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,\ntwo inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to\nthe-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,\nwhich have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes\nin the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest\nspecimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a\nspecies of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable\nelevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the\nconcentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles\nthe black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain\ngrowths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the\nIndians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its\nage to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of\nthe white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The\nnext largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,\nvariously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,\nwhich is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of\nthe redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from\nthe Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet\nin diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen of\nthe enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the\nimpossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room\nin the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of\nthe largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents\na circumference of about 110 feet.Then, too, the Californians object to\nhave the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other\npurposes.To accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr.Morris K.\nJesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of\nspecimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the\nexhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,\nand appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.Their commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be\nexhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the\ntar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued.Then, too, in\nan herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as\npossible in their natural state.When the collection is ready for public\nview next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete\none of its kind in the country.There is nothing like it in the world,\nas far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,\nFrance, or Germany.Aside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is\nproposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires\nthat teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food\nand clothing.The completeness of the exhibition will be of great\nassistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay\nout private and public parks so that the most striking effects of\nfoliage may be secured.The beauty of these effects can best be seen in\nthis country in our own Central Park, where there are more different\nvarieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other\narea in the United States.To ascertain how these effects are obtained\none now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees.With\nthis exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for\nthe botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to\nit.It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to\ncultivate trees as he would other crops.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.The rapid disappearance of\nmany valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in\nsupply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in\nthe not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the\ncountry.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *\n\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at

but alas!not\nunderstanding the nature of the instrument he was using, the poor\ncreature cut so deep a gash, that he bled profusely.He was found in\nthe situation described, with the razor still in his fingers, but\nunfortunately was too far gone to be recovered, and soon died, leaving a\ncaution to his fellows against playing with edged tools.\"\"I hope Jacko will never see any body shave,\" said Minnie, in a\nfaltering voice.\"Here is a funny story, my dear, about a monkey in the West Indies.The\nlittle fellow was kept tied to a stake in the open air, and was\nfrequently deprived of his food by the Johnny Crows.He tried to drive\nthem off, but without success, and at last made the following plan for\npunishing the thieves.\"Perceiving a flock of these birds coming toward him one day just after\nhis food had been brought, he lay down near his stake, and pretended to\nbe dead.For some time, he lay perfectly motionless, when the birds,\nreally deceived, approached by degrees, and got near enough to steal his\nfood, which he allowed them to do.This game he repeated several times,\ntill they became so bold as to come within reach of his claws, when he\nsuddenly sprang up and caught his victim in his firm grasp.He wished to make a man of him, according\nto the ancient definition, 'a biped without feathers,' and therefore,\nplucking the crow neatly, he let him go to show himself to his\ncompanions.This proved so effectual a punishment, that he was\nafterwards left to eat his food in peace.\"\"I don't see,\" said Minnie, thoughtfully, \"how a monkey could ever think\nof such a way.\"\"It certainly does show a great deal of sagacity,\" responded the lady,\n\"and a great deal of cunning in carrying out his plan.\"\"I hope there are ever so many anecdotes, mamma.\"\"Yes, my dear,\" she said, cheerfully,\n\"there are quite a number; some of them seem to be very amusing, but I\nhave only time to read you one more to-day.\"Guthrie gives an amusing account of a monkey named Jack.\"Seeing his master and friends drinking whiskey with great apparent\nrelish, he took the opportunity, when he thought he was unseen, to empty\ntheir half-filled glasses; and while they were roaring with laughter, he\nbegan to hop, skip, and jump.\"The next day, his master wanted to repeat the experiment, but found\nJack had not recovered from the effects of his dissipation.He commanded\nhim to come to the table; but the poor fellow put his hand to his head,\nand not all their endeavors could induce him to taste another drop all\nhis life.\"Jack became a thorough teetotaller.\"Minnie had a cousin Frank, the son of Mr.He was three years\nolder than Minnie, and was full of life and frolic.At one time he came to visit Minnie; and fine fun indeed they had with\nthe pets, the monkey being his especial favorite.Every day some new experiment was to be tried with Jacko, who, as Frank\ndeclared, could be taught any thing that they wished.One time, he took\nthe little fellow by the chain for a walk, Minnie gayly running by his\nside, and wondering what her cousin was going to do.On their way to the barn, they met Leo, who at once began to bark\nfuriously.\"That will never do, my brave fellow,\" exclaimed the boy; \"for we want\nyou to turn horse, and take Jacko to ride.\"urged Minnie, almost\ncrying.\"But I mean to make them good friends,\" responded the lad.\"Here, you\ntake hold of the chain, and I will coax the dog to be quiet while I put\nJacko on his back.\"This was not so easy as he had supposed; for no amount of coaxing or\nflattery would induce Leo to be impressed into this service.He hated\nthe monkey, and was greatly disgusted at his appearance as he hopped,\nfirst on Frank's shoulder, and then to the ground, his head sticking out\nof his little red jacket, and his face wearing a malicious grin.Finding they could not succeed in this, they went into the stable to\nvisit Star, when, with a quick motion, Jacko twitched the chain from\nMinnie's hand, and running up the rack above the manger, began to laugh\nand chatter in great glee.His tail, which had now fully healed, was of great use to him on this\noccasion, when, to Minnie's great surprise, he clung with it to the bar\nof the rack, and began to swing himself about.[Illustration: JACKO RUNNING AWAY.\"I heard of a monkey once,\" exclaimed Frank, laughing merrily, \"who made\ngreat use of his tail.If a nut or apple were thrown to him which fell\nbeyond his reach, he would run to the full length of his chain, turn his\nback, then stretch out his tail, and draw toward him the coveted\ndelicacy.\"\"Let's see whether Jacko would do so,\" shouted Minnie, greatly excited\nwith the project.There he goes up the\nhay mow, the chain dangling after him.\"\"If we don't try to catch him, he'll come quicker,\" said Minnie,\ngravely.\"I know another story about a monkey--a real funny one,\" added the boy.\"I don't know what his name was; but he used to sleep in the barn with\nthe cattle and horses.I suppose monkeys are always cold here; at any\nrate, this one was; and when he saw the hostler give the horse a nice\nfeed of hay, he said to himself, 'What a comfortable bed that would make\nfor me!'\"When the man went away, he jumped into the hay and hid, and every time\nthe horse came near enough to eat, he sprang forward and bit her ears\nwith his sharp teeth.\"Of course, as the poor horse couldn't get her food, she grew very thin,\nand at last was so frightened that the hostler could scarcely get her\ninto the stall.Several times he had to whip her before she would enter\nit, and then she stood as far back as possible, trembling like a leaf.\"It was a long time before they found out what the matter was; and then\nthe monkey had to take a whipping, I guess.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.\"If his mother had been there, she would have whipped him,\" said Minnie,\nlaughing.The little girl then repeated what her mother had told her of the\ndiscipline among monkeys, at which he was greatly amused.All this time, they were standing at the bottom of the hay mow, and\nsupposed that Jacko was safe at the top; but the little fellow was more\ncunning than they thought.He found the window open near the roof, where\nhay was sometimes pitched in, and ran down into the yard as quick as\nlightning.The first they knew of it was when John called out from the barnyard,\n\"Jacko, Jacko!It was a wearisome chase they had for the next hour, and at the end they\ncould not catch the runaway; but at last, when they sat down calmly in\nthe house, he stole back to his cage, and lay there quiet as a lamb.Minnie's face was flushed with her unusual exercise, but in a few\nminutes she grew very pale, until her mother became alarmed.After a few\ndrops of lavender, however, she said she felt better, and that if Frank\nwould tell her a story she should be quite well.\"That I will,\" exclaimed the boy, eagerly.\"I know a real funny one;\nyou like funny stories--don't you?\"\"Yes, when they're true,\" answered Minnie.A man was hunting, and he happened to kill a\nmonkey that had a little baby on her back.The little one clung so close\nto her dead mother, that they could scarcely get it away.When they\nreached the gentleman's house, the poor creature began to cry at\nfinding itself alone.All at once it ran across the room to a block,\nwhere a wig belonging to the hunter's father was placed, and thinking\nthat was its mother, was so comforted that it lay down and went to\nsleep.\"They fed it with goat's milk, and it grew quite contented, for three\nweeks clinging to the wig with great affection.\"The gentleman had a large and valuable collection of insects, which\nwere dried upon pins, and placed in a room appropriated to such\npurposes.\"One day, when the monkey had become so familiar as to be a favorite\nwith all in the family, he found his way to this apartment, and made a\nhearty breakfast on the insects.\"The owner, entering when the meal was almost concluded, was greatly\nenraged, and was about to chastise the animal, who had so quickly\ndestroyed the work of years, when he saw that the act had brought its\nown punishment.In eating the insects, the animal had swallowed the\npins, which very soon caused him such agony that he died.\"\"I don't call the last part funny at all,\" said Minnie, gravely.\"But wasn't it queer for it to think the wig was its mother?\"asked the\nboy, with a merry laugh.\"I don't think it could have had much sense to\ndo that.\"\"But it was only a baby monkey then, Harry.\"Lee, \"that Jacko got away from you?\"\"He watched his chance, aunty, and twitched the chain away from Minnie.Now he's done it once, he'll try the game again, I suppose, he is so\nfond of playing us tricks.\"And true enough, the very next morning the lady was surprised at a visit\nfrom the monkey in her chamber, where he made himself very much at home,\npulling open drawers, and turning over the contents, in the hope of\nfinding some confectionery, of which he was extremely fond.\"Really,\" she exclaimed to her husband, \"if Jacko goes on so, I shall\nbe of cook's mind, and not wish to live in the house with him.\"One day, Jacko observed nurse washing out some fine clothes for her\nmistress, and seemed greatly interested in the suds which she made in\nthe progress of her work.Lee's room while the family were at\nbreakfast one morning, and finding some nice toilet soap on the marble\nwashstand, began to rub it on some fine lace lying on the bureau.After\na little exertion, he was delighted to find that he had a bowl full of\nnice, perfumed suds, and was chattering to himself in great glee, when\nAnn came in and spoiled his sport.\"You good for nothing, mischievous creature,\" she cried out, in sudden\nwrath, \"I'll cure you of prowling about the house in this style.\"Giving him a cuff across his head with a shoe, \"Go back to your cage,\nwhere you belong.\"\"Jacko is really getting to be very troublesome,\" remarked the lady to\nher husband.\"I can't tell how much longer my patience with him will\nlast.\"\"Would Minnie mourn very much if she were to lose him?\"\"I suppose she would for a time; but then she has so many pets to take\nup her attention.\"Just then the child ran in, her eyes filled with tears, exclaiming,--\n\n\"Father, does Jacko know any better?\"Because,\" she went on, \"I found him crouched down in his cage, looking\nvery sorry; and nurse says he ought to be ashamed of himself, cutting\nup such ridiculous capers.\"\"I dare say he feels rather guilty,\" remarked Mr.\"He must be\ntaught better, or your mother will be tired of him.\"When her father had gone to the city, Minnie looked so grave that her\nmother, to comfort her, took the book and read her some stories.A few\nof them I will repeat to you.\"A lady was returning from India, in a ship on board of which there was\na monkey.She was a very mild, gentle creature, and readily learned any\nthing that was taught her.When she went to lie down at night, she made\nup her bed in imitation of her mistress, then got in and wrapped herself\nup neatly with the quilt.Sometimes she would wrap her head with a\nhandkerchief.\"When she did wrong, she would kneel and clasp her hands, seeming\nearnestly to ask to be forgiven.\"\"A gentleman boarding with his wife at a hotel in Paris had a pet\nmonkey, who was very polite.One day his master met him going down\nstairs; and when the gentleman said 'good morning,' the animal took off\nhis cap and made a very polite bow.Upon\nthis the monkey held out a square piece of paper.said the gentleman; 'your mistress' gown is dusty.'\"Jack instantly took a small brush from his master's pocket, raised the\nhem of the lady's dress, cleaned it, and then did the same to his\nmaster's shoes, which were also dusty.\"When they gave him any thing to eat, he did not cram his pouches with\nit, but delicately and tidily devoured it; and when, as frequently\noccurred, strangers gave him money, he always put it in his master's\nhands.\"\"Do you think, mamma, I could teach Jacko to do so?\"\"I can't say, my dear; and indeed I think it would be hardly worth the\npains to spend a great deal of time in teaching him.He seems to learn\nquite fast enough by himself.Indeed, he is so full of tricks, and so\ntroublesome to cook in hiding her kitchen utensils, I am afraid we shall\nhave to put him in close confinement.\"\"I had rather uncle Frank would carry him back to Africa,\" sighed the\nchild.\"Well, dear, I wouldn't grieve about it now.We must manage somehow till\nuncle Frank comes, and then perhaps he can tell us what to do.\"A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome\nthat the servants were constantly complaining.\"\"That seems similar to our case,\" said the lady, smiling, as she\ninterrupted the reading.\"One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into\nthe next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately\nopen.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,\nlaces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away\nvigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be\nfound in the room.\"When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in\nspreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry.\"He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to\nhim, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case\nof the large kitchen clock.\"The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his\nplace of refuge when he was in disgrace.\"One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for\ndinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon\nmanaged to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam\nfowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and\nbegan plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the\nservants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in\nsuch a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,\n\"I wonder how old that monkey was.\"\"The book does not mention his age, my dear.\"I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;\nand then I said to myself, 'That one must have been young.'\"\"If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,\"\nremarked the lady.\"His company does not begin to compensate for the\ntrouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and\ntractable.\"\"And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?\"\"I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better\nkind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny\ntricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I\nknew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I\nshould be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; \"O, mamma, I wouldn't\nhave one of my pets killed for any thing.\"Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie's fate, but\nshe wisely said nothing.I don't want to think about such awful\nthings.\"The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently\nshe said, \"Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but\nfirst I must explain to you what a sounding-board is.\"In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the\npulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was\nthought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the\ncongregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my\ngrandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a\nsounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would\nfall on the minister's head and kill him.\"There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept\nin his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,\nwhich was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he\nwent out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out\nof sight, on his way to church.\"But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under\nhis arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the\nopportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,\nran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board.\"Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on\nthe congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle.\"The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much\nenjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the\nsounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was\nunconscious of his presence.\"When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with\nlaughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it\nhis duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action\nof his hands and arms.\"The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every\nmotion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the\ncountenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the\nmost solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity\nappear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,\nevery word being enforced by great energy of action.\"All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with\nardor and exactness.\"The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man\nand his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of\ncomposure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one\nof the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the\nirreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the\nmerriment.\"Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal\nstanding on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his\nmight, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly\nexasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey\nremoved, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to\nrecover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed.\"CHAPTER V.\n\nJACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching\nmice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to\ngood account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,\ndetermined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.Lee on a journey,\nand shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his\ncomfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every\nthing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and\nwell secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this\ntreatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup\ntureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over\nthe place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke\nshivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup\ntureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he\nbegan to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on\nthe upper shelf.\"There is something good,\" he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,\nraspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,\ndisappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in\na corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave\na scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a\nthousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her\nthat this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,\nwho began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his\nstomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his\nexcess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an\nexperiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new\nmischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,\nlaughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as\nhe said, \"We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;\nbut you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.\"Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?\"\"I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I\ncan find any for you.\"He opened the book, and then asked,--\n\n\"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in\ntheir cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the\nanimal look wrinkled?\"\"No, sir; I never heard about it.\"He puts his food in them, and keeps it there\ntill he wishes to devour it.\"There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;\nthat is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,\nand which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The\nfacility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the\nbranches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it\nmakes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,\nit is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it\nto swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.\"\"I'm sure, father,\" eagerly cried Minnie, \"that Jacko has a prehensile\ntail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the\nhay mow.\"But here is an\naccount of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black\nhands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called\nHoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be\none of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to\ndeath; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy\ngreat quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by\nthe natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone\nwould compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us\nthat their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are\nraised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in\nwhich they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A\nhand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum\nin Paris.\"\"Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures\nor hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other\nsubstances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they\ndo not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general\ncry being kept up by the party.\"One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor.\"Mamma,\" she\nexclaimed, \"cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families.\"I suppose, my dear,\" she responded, \"that there is a\ndifference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very\nfond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount\nthem on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection.\"But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,\nand if I can find the book, I will read it to you.\"\"There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most\nbeautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from\nits extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at\nliberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in\norder to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a\nwife.\"For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every\nattention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much\ncruelty.\"One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than\nusual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,\nafter winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and\ndrew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave\nher a push, which threw her into the sea.\"This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he\ndescended in high spirits.\"\"I should think they would have punished him,\" said Minnie, with great\nindignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no\nmeans always to be depended upon.\"Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one\nmore story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to grat", "question": "Where is John?

but soon the water\nbegan to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly\nsat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have\nbeen boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and\nfirmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,\nwho, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head\nand pulled him out.\"He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon\nrecovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot\nexperience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire.\"When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a\nmenagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.She was\ngreatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty\nquestions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their\nway home, she inquired,--\n\n\"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.\"Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot\nconceive of.\"\"I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets,\" added her\nmother, laughing.\"I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,\"\nanswered the child.\"But, father, will you please tell me something\nmore about the curious animals?\"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had\nstopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered\nabout some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to\nget out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,\nand then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in\nthe road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had\ngone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which\nMinnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like\nher.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it\nseemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he\nfound her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave\nJohn orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering\nwhether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy\npaid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature\nmust be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many\nadmonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her\nthoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the\nanimal, which he read to her.\"The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like\nhead, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form\nand position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and\nhands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as\nit is disgusting.\"\"Then follows an account,\" the gentleman went on, \"of the peculiarities\nof different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.\"\"But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?\"\"I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that\nthey are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper.\"They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the\nseverest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to\ntheir own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions\nare cruel, destructive, and disgusting.\"\"I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples,\" said Minnie; \"but\nhe did not give them any meat all the time I was there.\"\"No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable\nmatter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of\nGood Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to\ndestroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and\ngardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the\ndogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the\ngun.\"As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage\nincreases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible\nfury.\"\"Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking\nencyclopaedia.\"Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless\nthey go into gardens?\"\"I rather think I should soon convince them they\nwere not to enter my garden,\" he said, emphatically.\"But seriously,\nthey descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in\na few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,\nthey move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to\ngive notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,\nthe sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with\nthe greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into\ntheir cheek pouches.\"Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her\nmother said, \"I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named\nKees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.\"\"Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,\"\nsaid the gentleman, rising.\"It was in a book of travels in Africa,\" the lady went on.\"The\ntraveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his\njourney, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a\nsentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his\nsense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of\nprey, when every thing was apparently secure.\"There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they\ncame across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were\nunacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he\nthrew them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or\ndisagreeable, and left them untasted.\"Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these\nexcursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the\nsport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he\nshowed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance\nabout, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was\nvery fond.\"I recall one amusing trick of Kees,\" said the lady, laughing, \"which\npleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows\nof trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of\nwhich his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he\nwould run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it\nas fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him.\"These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner\nof doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong\nteeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself\ngradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,\nwhile he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,\nwhich gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come\nout.\"Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired\nwith the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the\ndogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew\nweary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into\nservice.As soon as Kees leaped on\nhis back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the\nspot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until\nthe party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great\nhaste to overtake their master.\"Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were\naccustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the\nslightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their\nplaces about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them\ncame too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,\nand thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.\"\"Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed,\" said Minnie,\nwith considerable warmth.\"I have told you the best traits of his character,\" she answered,\nsmiling.\"He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He\ncould not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He\nunderstood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take\nthe cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it\nwhenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these\nmisdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good.\"Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his\nservants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any\nthing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,\ngenerally deserved it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.\"The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the\nplace; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the\nbroken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a\nsevere beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the\ngentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as\nsoon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast.\"One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of\na bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had\ncarefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran\nout of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,\nbut found not a bean left, and Kees missing.\"When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some\nhours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched\nevery where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really\ndeserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a\ndistance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and\nspoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not\ncome down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take\nhim.\"\"No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only\none thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le\nVaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,\npretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that\ntime could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at\na distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;\nand had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the\ninsult.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\n    \"Nature is man's best teacher.She unfolds\n    Her treasures to his search, unseals his eye,\n    Illumes his mind, and purifies his heart,--\n    An influence breathes from all the sights and sounds\n    Of her existence;

all the children of a Duke,\nfor instance, are Dukes and Duchesses.In France, and in most other\ncountries where the system of Estates existed, the Estate of the Nobles\nin the National Assembly was a representation, in some shape or other,\nof the whole class of nobles as a distinct body.How different this is\nfrom our House of Lords I need not point out.In strictness, I repeat,\nwe have no nobility.The seats in our Upper Chamber go by descent and\nnot by election or nomination; but no political privilege attaches\nto the children of their holders.Even the eldest son of the peer,\nthe future holder of the peerage, is a commoner as long as his father\nlives.Whatever titles he bears are simply titles of courtesy which\ncarry with them no political privileges above other commoners.As the children of the peer have no special\nadvantage, so neither have the younger children of the King himself.The King\u2019s wife, his eldest son, his eldest daughter, his eldest son\u2019s\nwife, all have special privileges by Law.His other children are\nsimple commoners, unless their father thinks good to raise them, as\nhe may raise any other of his subjects, to the rank of peerage(48).There is perhaps no feature in our Constitution more important and\nmore beneficial than this, which binds all ranks together, and which\nhas hindered us from suffering at any time under the curse of a noble\ncaste.Yet this marked distinction between our own Constitution and\nthat of most other countries is purely traditional.We cannot say that\nit was enacted by any particular man or in any particular Assembly.But\nit is easy to see that the fact that in England our national Assemblies\nalways went on in some shape or other, that the right of all freemen\nto attend in person was never formally abolished, that the King kept\nthe right of specially summoning whom he would, all helped to hinder\nthe growth of an exclusive noble caste.The aristocratic sentiment, the\npride of birth, has doubtless been very strong at all times.But it has\nbeen merely a sentiment, resting on no legal foundation.The Crown\ncould always ennoble any one; but the nobility so granted belonged to\none only of the family at the time, to the actual owner of the peerage.All ranks could at all times freely intermarry; all offices were open\nto all freemen; and England, unlike Germany, never saw ecclesiastical\nfoundations whose members were bound to be of noble birth.The position of the Estate of the Clergy was also widely different in\nEngland from what it was in other countries.In fact the political\nposition of the Clergy has, ever since Edward the First, been something\nutterly anomalous and inconsistent.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Elsewhere the representatives of\nthe Clergy, just like those of the Nobles, formed one distinct Estate\nin the Assembly.In England the great Prelates had seats in the House\nof Lords, where the Bishops keep them still.But there also existed\nthe anomalous body called Convocation, whose character has always\nfluctuated between that of an ecclesiastical Synod and that of a\nparliamentary Estate of the realm(49).The Clergy are still summoned\nalong with every Parliament; and one distinctly parliamentary function\nthey held down to the reign of Charles the Second, which was then\ntaken away without any formal enactment.It was one of our great\nconstitutional principles established in King Edward\u2019s days that no tax\ncould be granted to the King except by those who had to pay it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.But for\na long time the Lords and the Commons taxed themselves separately, and\nthe Clergy in their Convocation taxed themselves separately also.And,\ntill this power was given up, an ecclesiastical benefice gave no right\nto vote in the election of members of the House of Commons(50).The Commons too themselves bear a name which had a far different\nmeaning in England from what it bore elsewhere.The usage by which\nthe Knights of the shire and the Citizens and Burgesses were brought\ntogether in a single House, whatever was its origin, whether it were\nat first the result of design or of happy accident, has been an\nusage no less wholesome, no less needful to our full constitutional\ndevelopement, than that which decreed that the children of peers\nshould be commoners.In most other countries the class of men who\nwere returned as representatives of the counties, the Knights of\nthe Shire, would have been members of the Estate of the Nobles.In\nFrance the words _nobleman_ and _gentleman_ had the same meaning,\nthat of the members of an exclusive aristocratic caste.The Commons,\nthe Third Estate, consisted of the citizens of the privileged towns\nonly(51).But in England the middle class was not confined to the\ntowns; it spread itself, in the form of a lesser gentry and a wealthy\nyeomanry, over the whole face of the land.That class, the smaller\nlandowners, was for a long time the strength of the country, and the\nhappiest results came from the union of their representatives in a\nsingle chamber with those of the cities and boroughs.Each class gained\nstrength from its fellowship with the other, and the citizen class\ngained, from their union on equal terms with the landed gentry, a\nconsideration which otherwise they might never have reached.In short,\nthe union of the two, the union of all classes of freemen except the\nclergy and the actual members of the peerage, of all classes from the\npeer\u2019s eldest son to the smallest freeholder or burgess, made the House\nof Commons a real representation of the whole nation, and not of any\nsingle order in the nation.Mark again that the form of government which political writers call\n_bi-cameral_, that is to say, where the Legislative Assembly consists\nof two Chambers or Houses, arose out of one of the accidents of English\nHistory.The merits of that form of government are now freely under\ndiscussion, but it is assumed on both sides that the only choice\nlies between one chamber and two; no one proposes to have three or\nfour(52).But most of the continental bodies of Estates consisted,\nas we have seen, of three Houses; in Sweden, where the peasants, the\nsmall freeholders, were important enough to be separately represented\nalongside of the Nobles, Clergy, and Citizens, there were till lately\nfour(53).The number two became the number of our Houses of Parliament,\nnot out of any conviction of the advantages of that number, but because\nit was found impossible to get the Clergy in England habitually to\nact, as they did elsewhere, as a regular member of the parliamentary\nbody.They shrank from the burthen, or they deemed secular legislation\ninconsistent with their profession.Thus, instead of the Clergy\nforming, as they did in France, a distinct Estate of the Legislature,\nwe got a Parliament of two Houses, Lords and Commons, attended by a\nkind of ecclesiastical shadow of the Parliament in the shape of the\ntwo Houses of the ecclesiastical Convocation.Thus, for all practical\npurposes, there were only two Estates in the English Parliament, Lords\nand Commons.Thus the phrase of the Three Estates, which had a meaning\nin France, became meaningless in England.For centuries back there has\nbeen no separate Estate of the Clergy; some of their highest members\nhave belonged to the Estate of the Lords, and the rest to the Estate of\nthe Commons.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Hence has arisen a common but not unnatural misconception,\na misconception as old as the days of the Long Parliament, as to the\nmeaning of the phrase of the Three Estates.Men constantly use those\nwords as if they meant the three elements among which the legislative\npower is divided, King, Lords, and Commons.But an Estate means a rank\nor order or class of men, like the Lords, the Clergy, or the Commons.The King is not an Estate, because there is no class or order of\nKings, the King being one person alone by himself.The proper phrase\nis the King and the three Estates of the Realm.But in England, as I\nhave already shown, the phrase is meaningless, as we have in truth two\nEstates only(54).We thus had in England, not an Estate of Nobles, forming a distinct\nclass from the people, but an Upper House of hereditary and official\nLords, whose privileges were purely personal, and whose children had\nno political privilege above other men.Our Bishops and some other of\nour ecclesiastical dignitaries had seats in the Upper House, but there\nwas no distinct Estate of the Clergy, having its distinct voice in\nlegislation.Our Lower House, lower in name, but gradually to become\nupper in real power, came to represent, not merely the inhabitants\nof privileged towns, but the whole nation, with the single exception\nof the personal holders of hereditary or official seats in the Upper\nHouse.That such an Assembly should gradually draw to itself all the\nreal powers of the state was in the nature of things; but it was only\ngradually that it did so.Few things in our parliamentary history are\nmore remarkable than the way in which the two Houses have for the most\npart worked together.I am not talking of very modern times, but of\ntimes when the two Houses were really coordinate powers in the state.During the six hundred years that the two Houses have lived side by\nside, serious disputes between them have been very rare, and those\ndisputes which have happened have generally had to do with matters of\nform and privilege which were chiefly interesting to members of the two\nHouses themselves, not with questions which had any great importance\nfor the nation at large(55).For a while the Commons followed the lead\nof the Lords; then the Lords came gradually to follow the lead of the\nCommons; but open and violent breaches between the Houses have been\nrare indeed.From the days of Earl Simon onwards, both the power of\nParliament as a whole, and the special power of the House of Commons,\nwas constantly growing.The Parliaments of the fourteenth century\nexercised all the powers which our Parliament exercises now, together\nwith some which modern Parliaments shrink from exercising.That is to\nsay, the Parliaments of those days were obliged either to do directly\nor to leave undone many things which the developement of political\nconventionality enables a modern Parliament to do indirectly.The\nancient Parliaments demanded the dismissal of the King\u2019s ministers;\nthey regulated his personal household; they put his authority into\ncommission; if need called for such a step, they put forth their last\nand greatest power and deposed him from his kingly office.In those\ndays a change of government, a change of policy, the getting rid of\na bad minister and the putting a better in his place, were things\nwhich never could be done without an open struggle between King and\nParliament; often they could not be done without the bondage, the\nimprisonment, or the death, perhaps only of the minister, perhaps even\nof the King himself.The same ends can now be gained by a vote of\ncensure in the House of Commons; in many cases they can be gained even\nwithout a vote of censure, by the simple throwing out of a measure by\nwhich a Ministry has given out that it will stand or fall(56).The fifteenth century, as compared with the thirteenth and fourteenth,\nwas in some respects a time in which things went back.It is plain\nthat the Parliaments of that day were bodies which were much less\nindependent than the Parliaments of earlier times.During the Wars of\nthe Roses each successive military victor found a Parliament ready to\nconfirm his claim to the Crown and to decree the condemnation of his\nenemies(57).And it was a Parliament of Henry the Sixth which passed\nthe most reactionary measure which any Parliament ever did pass,\nthat by which the qualification for a county elector was narrowed to\nthose freeholders whose estates were of the yearly value of forty\nshillings(58).In this case time and the change in the value of money\nhave redressed the wrong; there may be freeholders whose estates are\nunder the value of forty shillings, but I cannot think that they are\nnow a very large or important class.But, to understand the meaning of\nthe restriction in the fifteenth century, for forty shillings we may\nfairly read forty pounds; and certainly, if we struck off the register\nall those electors whose qualification is a freehold\u2014much more those\nwhose qualification is an estate less than a freehold\u2014under the value\nof forty pounds, the lessening of the constituencies of our counties\nwould not be small.On the other hand, during the revolutionary times\nwhich followed, we more than once hear of direct appeals to the people\nwhich remind us of days far earlier.Edward the Fourth and Richard the\nThird were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown\nacknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us\nof the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59).Still even in this age, the\npower of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender\nto get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the\ngrowing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which\nshow that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a\nshire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for\nmen of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even\nfor the sons of members of the Upper House(61).At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary\ninstitutions in so many countries of Europe.Not a few assemblies which\nhad once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,\neither utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities.Then it\nwas that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free\nconstitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General\nof France met for the last time before their last meeting of all\non the eve of the great Revolution(62).In England parliamentary\ninstitutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty\nform.But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,\nbecame perverted into instruments of tyranny.Under Henry the Eighth,\nParliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed\nwhatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot.Why had they so\nfallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they\nwere to be again?The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained\nstrength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to\nbe an independent body.The old nobility had been cut off at Towton\nand Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King\nto whom they owed their honours.A century later, the new nobility\nhad inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the\nfulness of their power.Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments\nof the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant\u2019s will, of\nwhich we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the four", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Very different indeed from the Parliaments which\noverthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments\nwhich, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against\nany man against whom Henry\u2019s caprice had turned, the Parliaments\nwhich, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready\nto enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which\nfor the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his\nson or to his daughters.Why, it may be asked, in such a state of\nthings, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they\nperished in so many other lands?It might be enough to say that no\nruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that\nhe could so conveniently turn to his own purposes.But why did not\nthose institutions sink into mere forms, which they certainly did not\ndo, even in the worst times?One reason undoubtedly is that special\ninsular position of our country which has in so many other ways\ngiven a peculiar turn to our history.The great foe of parliamentary\ninstitutions was the introduction of standing armies.But the sovereign\nof England, shut up within his island, had far less need of a standing\narmy than the sovereigns of the Continent, engaged as they were in\ntheir ceaseless wars with neighbours on their frontiers.But I believe\nthat the personal character of Henry the Eighth had a great deal to\ndo with the final preservation of our liberties.Do not for a moment\nfancy that I belong to that school of paradox which sets up Henry the\nEighth as a virtuous and beneficent ruler.Do not think that I claim\nfor him any feelings of direct thankfulness such as I do claim for\nEarl Simon and King Edward.The position of Henry is more like the\nposition of William the Conqueror, though I certainly hold that the\nConqueror was in everything the better man of the two.Both served the\ncause of freedom indirectly, and both served it by means of features\nin the personal character of each.In one respect indeed William and\nHenry stood in utterly different positions towards England.William was\na stranger, and it was largely because he was a stranger that he was\nable to do us indirect good.Henry, with all his crimes, was a thorough\nEnglishman; throughout his reign there was a sympathy between him and\nthe mass of his subjects, who, after all, did not greatly suffer by the\noccasional beheading of a Queen or a Duke.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.But the despotism of William\nand the despotism of Henry agreed in this, that each, even in his worst\ndeeds, retained a scrupulous regard for the letter of the Law.In the\ncase of William this is not hard to see for any one who carefully\nstudies the records of his age(63); in the case of Henry it stands\nboldly proclaimed in the broadest facts of English history.While his\nfellow-tyrants abroad were everywhere overthrowing free institutions,\nHenry was in all things showing them the deepest outward respect.Throughout his reign he took care to do nothing except in outward and\nregular legal form, nothing for which he could not shelter himself\nunder the sanction either of precedent or of written Law.In itself,\nthis perversion of Law, this clothing of wrong with the garb of right,\nis really worse\u2014at all events it is more corrupting\u2014than deeds of open\nviolence against which men are tempted openly to revolt.But such a\ntyranny as Henry\u2019s is one form of the homage which vice pays to virtue;\nthe careful preservation of the outward forms of freedom makes it\neasier for another and happier generation again to kindle the form into\nits ancient spirit and life.Every deed of wrong done by Henry with the\nassent of Parliament was in truth a witness to the abiding importance\nof Parliament; the very degradation of our ancient Constitution was a\nstep to its revival with new strength and in a more perfect form(64).A like witness to the importance of Parliament in this age was shown\nin two other very remarkable ways, whereby the power and importance of\nthe House of Commons was acknowledged in the very act of corrupting\nit.One was the active interference of the Government in parliamentary\nelections; the other was the creation of boroughs in order to be\ncorrupt.One needs no stronger proofs than these of the importance\nof the body which it was found needful thus to pack and to manage.The Crown still kept the power of summoning members from any boroughs\nwhich it thought fit, and throughout the Tudor reigns the power was\nfreely abused by sending writs to places which were likely to return\nmembers who would be subservient to the Court(65).Thus arose many\nof the wretched little boroughs in Cornwall and elsewhere which were\ndisfranchised by our successive Reform Bills.These boroughs, which\nalways were corrupt and which were created in order to be corrupt, must\nbe carefully distinguished from another class which perished with them.Many towns to which Earl Simon and King Edward sent writs decayed in\nprocess of time; sometimes they decayed positively; more commonly they\ndecayed relatively, by being utterly outstripped by younger towns and\nso losing the importance which they had once had.The disfranchisement\nof both classes was equally just; but the different history of the two\nclasses should be carefully borne in mind.It was right to take away\nits members from Old Sarum, but there had been a time when it was right\nto give Old Sarum members.In the case of a crowd of Cornish boroughs,\nit not only was right to take away their members, but they never ought\nto have had members at all(66).It was in the days of Elizabeth that something of the ancient spirit\nagain breathed forth.It is then that we come to the beginning of that\nlong line of parliamentary worthies which stretches on in unbroken\norder from her days to our own.A few daring spirits in the Commons\u2019\nHouse now began once more to speak in tones worthy of those great\nAssemblies which had taught the Edwards and the Richards that there\nwas a power in England mightier than their own(67).Under the puny\nsuccessor of the great Queen the voice of freedom was heard more\nloudly(68).In the next reign the great strife of all came, and a King\nof England once more, as in the days of Henry and Simon, stood forth\nin arms against his people to learn that the power of his people was\na greater power than his.But in the seventeenth century, just as in\nthe thirteenth, men did not ask for any rights and powers which were\nadmitted to be new; they asked only for the better security of those\nrights and powers which had been handed on from days of old.Into the\ndetails of that great struggle and of the times which followed it is\nnot my purpose to enter.I have traced at some length the origin and\ngrowth of our Constitution from the earliest times to its days of\nspecial trial in the days of Tudor and Stewart despotism.Our later\nconstitutional history rather belongs to an inquiry of another kind.It is mainly a record of silent changes in the practical working of\ninstitutions whose outward and legal form remained untouched.I will\ntherefore end my consecutive historical sketch\u2014if consecutive it can\nclaim to be\u2014at the point which we have now reached.Instead of carrying\non any regular constitutional narrative into times nearer to our own, I\nwill rather choose, as the third part of my subject, the illustration\nof one of the special points with which I set out, namely the power\nwhich our gradual developement has given us of retracing our steps, of\nfalling back, whenever need calls for falling back, on the principles\nof earlier, often of the earliest, times.Wittingly or unwittingly,\nmuch of our best modern legislation has, as I have already said, been\na case of advancing by the process of going back.As the last division\nof the work which I have taken in hand, I shall try to show in how\nmany cases we have, as a matter of fact, gone back from the cumbrous\nand oppressive devices of feudal and royalist lawyers to the sounder,\nfreer, and simpler principles of the days of our earliest freedom.IN my two former chapters I have carried my brief sketch of the history\nof the English Constitution down to the great events of the seventeenth\ncentury.I chose that point as the end of my consecutive narrative,\nbecause the peculiar characteristic of the times which have followed\nhas been that so many and such important practical changes have been\nmade without any change in the written Law, without any re-enactment of\nthe Law, without any fresh declaration of its meaning.The movements\nand revolutions of former times, as I have before said, seldom sought\nany acknowledged change in the Law, but rather its more distinct\nenactment, its more careful and honest administration.This was the\ngeneral character of all the great steps in our political history, from\nthe day when William of Normandy renewed the Laws of Eadward to the day\nwhen William of Orange gave his royal assent to the Bill of Rights.But, though each step in our progress took the shape, not of the\ncreation of a new right, but of the firmer establishment of an old one,\nyet each step was marked by some formal and public act which stands\nenrolled among the landmarks of our progress.Some Charter was granted\nby the Sovereign, some Act of Parliament was passed by the Estates\nof the Realm, setting forth in legal form the nature and measure of\nthe rights which it was sought to place on a firmer ground.Since\nthe seventeenth century things have in this respect greatly altered.The work of legislation, of strictly constitutional legislation, has\nnever ceased; a long succession of legislative enactments stand out as\nlandmarks of political progress no less in more recent than in earlier\ntimes.But alongside of them there has also been a series of political\nchanges, changes of no less moment than those which are recorded in the\nstatute-book, which have been made without any legislative enactment\nwhatever.A whole code of political maxims, universally acknowledged\nin theory, universally carried out in practice, has grown up, without\nleaving among the formal acts of our legislature any trace of the\nsteps by which it grew.Up to the end of the seventeenth century,\nwe may fairly say that no distinction could be drawn between the\nConstitution and the Law.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.The prerogative of the Crown, the privilege\nof Parliament, the liberty of the subject, might not always be clearly\ndefined on every point.It has indeed been said that those three things\nwere all of them things to which in their own nature no limit could be\nset.But all three were supposed to rest, if not on the direct words\nof the Statute Law, yet at least on that somewhat shadowy yet very\npractical creation, that mixture of genuine ancient traditions and of\nrecent devices of lawyers, which is known to Englishmen as the Common\nLaw.Any breach either of the rights of the Sovereign or of the rights\nof the subject was a legal offence, capable of legal definition and\nsubjecting the offender to legal penalties.An act which could not be\nbrought within the letter either of the Statute or of the Common Law\nwould not then have been looked upon as an offence at all.If lower\ncourts were too weak to do justice, the High Court of Parliament stood\nready to do justice even against the mightiest offenders.It was armed\nwith weapons fearful and rarely used, but none the less regular and\nlegal.It could smite by impeachment, by attainder, by the exercise\nof the greatest power of all, the deposition of the reigning King.But men had not yet reached the more subtle doctrine that there may\nbe offences against the Constitution which are no offences against\nthe Law.They had not learned that men in high office may have a\nresponsibility practically felt and acted on, but which no legal\nenactment has defined, and which no legal tribunal can enforce.It had\nnot been found out that Parliament itself has a power, now practically\nthe highest of its powers, in which it acts neither as a legislature\nnor as a court of justice, but in which it pronounces sentences which\nhave none the less practical force because they carry with them none of\nthe legal consequences of death, bonds, banishment, or confiscation.We\nnow have a whole system of political morality, a whole code of precepts\nfor the guidance of public men, which will not be found in any page of\neither the Statute or the Common Law, but which are in practice held\nhardly less sacred than any principle embodied in the Great Charter\nor in the Petition of Right.In short, by the side of our written Law\nthere has grown up an unwritten or conventional Constitution.When an\nEnglishman speaks of the conduct of a public man being constitutional\nor unconstitutional, he means something wholly different from what he\nmeans by his conduct being legal or illegal.A famous vote of the House\nof Commons, passed on the motion of a great statesman, once declared\nthat the then Ministers of the Crown did not possess the confidence\nof the House of Commons, and that their continuance in office was\ntherefore at variance with the spirit of the Constitution(1).The truth\nof such a position, according to the traditional principles on which\npublic men have acted for some generations, cannot be disputed; but\nit would be in vain to seek for any trace of such doctrines in any\npage of our written Law.The proposer of that motion did not mean to\ncharge the existing Ministry with any illegal act, with any act which\ncould be made the subject either of a prosecution in a lower court\nor of impeachment in the High Court of Parliament itself.He did not\nmean that they, Ministers of the Crown, appointed during the pleasure\nof the Crown, committed any breach of the Law of which the Law could\ntake cognizance, merely by keeping possession of their offices till\nsuch time as the Crown should think good to dismiss them from those\noffices.What he meant was that the general course of their policy was\none which to a majority of the House of Commons did not seem to be\nwise or beneficial to the nation, and that therefore, according to a\nconventional code as well understood and as effectual as the written\nLaw itself, they were bound to resign offices of which the House of\nCommons no longer held them to be worthy.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.The House made no claim to\ndismiss those Ministers from their offices by any act of its own; it\ndid not even petition the Crown to remove them from their offices.It\nsimply spoke its mind on their general conduct, and it was held that,\nwhen the House had so spoken, it was their duty to give way without\nany formal petition, without any formal command, on the part either\nof the House or of the Sovereign(2).The passing by the House of\nCommons of such a resolution as this may perhaps be set down as the\nformal declaration of a constitutional principle.But though a formal\ndeclaration, it was not a legal declaration.It created a precedent for\nthe practical guidance of future Ministers and future Parliaments, but\nit neither changed the Law nor declared it.It asserted a principle\nwhich might be appealed to in future debates in the House of Commons,\nbut it asserted no principle which could be taken any notice of by a\nJudge in any Court of Law.It stands therefore on a wholly different\nground from those enactments which, whether they changed the Law or\nsimply declared the Law, had a real legal force, capable of being\nenforced by a legal tribunal.If any officer of the Crown should levy a\ntax without the authority of Parliament, if he should enforce martial\nlaw without the authority of Parliament, he would be guilty of a legal\ncrime.But, if he merely continues to hold an office conferred by the\nCrown and from which the Crown has not removed him, though he hold it\nin the teeth of any number of votes of censure passed by both Houses of\nParliament, he is in no way a breaker of the written Law.But the man\nwho should so act would be universally held to have trampled under foot\none of the most undoubted principles of the unwritten but universally\naccepted Constitution.The remarkable thing is that, of these two kinds of hypothetical\noffences, the latter, the guilt of which is purely conventional, is\nalmost as unlikely to happen as the former, whose guilt is a matter\nestablished by Law.The power of the Law is so firmly established among\nus that the possibility of breaches of the Law on the part of the\nCrown or its Ministers hardly ever comes into our heads.And conduct\nsinning against the broad lines of the unwritten Constitution is looked\non as hardly less unlikely.Political men may debate whether such and\nsuch a course is or is not constitutional, just as lawyers may debate\nwhether such a course is or is not legal.But the very form of the\ndebate implies that there is a Constitution to be observed, just as\nin the other case it implies that there is a Law to be observed.Now\nthis firm establishment of a purely unwritten and conventional code\nis one of the most remarkable facts in history.It is plain that it\nimplies the firmest possible establishment of the power of the written\nLaw as its groundwork.If there were the least fear of breaches of the\nwritten Law on the part of the Crown or its officers, we should be\nengaged in finding means for getting rid of that more serious danger,\nnot in disputing over points arising out of a code which has no legal\nexistence.But it is well sometimes to stop and remember how thoroughly\nconventional the whole of our received system is.The received doctrine\nas to the relations of the two Houses of Parliament to one another, the\nwhole theory of the position of the body known as the Cabinet and of\nits chief the Prime Minister, every detail in short of the practical\nworking of government among us, is a matter belonging wholly to the\nunwritten Constitution and not at all to the written Law.The limits\nof the royal authority are indeed clearly defined by the written Law.But I suspect that many people would be amazed at the amount of power\nwhich the Crown still possesses by Law, and at the many things, which\nin our eyes would seem utterly monstrous, but which might yet be done\nby royal authority without any law being broken.The Law indeed secures\nus against arbitrary legislation, against the repeal of any old laws,\nor the enactment of any new ones, without the consent of both Houses\nof Parliament(3).But it is the unwritten Constitution alone which\nmakes it practically impossible for the Crown to refuse its assent to\nmeasures which have passed both Houses of Parliament, and which in many\ncases makes it almost equally impossible to refuse the prayer of an\naddress sent up by one of those Houses only.The written Law leaves to\nthe Crown the choice of all its ministers and agents, great and small;\ntheir appointment to office and their removal from office, as long as\nthey commit no crime which the Law can punish, is a matter left to\nthe personal discretion of the Sovereign.The unwritten Constitution\nmakes it practically impossible for the Sovereign to keep a Minister\nin office of whom the House of Commons does not approve, and it makes\nit almost equally impossible to remove from office a Minister of\nwhom the House of Commons does approve(4).The written Law and the\nunwritten Constitution alike exempt the Sovereign from all ordinary\npersonal responsibility(5).They both transfer the responsibility from\nthe Sovereign himself to his agents and advisers.But the nature and\nextent of their responsibility is widely different in the eyes of the\nwritten Law and in the eyes of the unwritten Constitution.The written\nLaw is satisfied with holding that the command of the Sovereign is no\nexcuse for an illegal act, and that he who advises the commission of\nan illegal act by royal authority must bear the responsibility from\nwhich the Sovereign himself is free.The written Law knows nothing of\nany responsibility but such as may be enforced either by prosecution in\nthe ordinary Courts or by impeachment in the High Court of Parliament.The unwritten Constitution lays the agents and advisers of the Crown\nunder a responsibility of quite another kind.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.What we understand by\nthe responsibility of Ministers is that they are liable to have all\ntheir public acts discussed in Parliament, not only on the ground\nof their legal or illegal character, but on the vaguest grounds of\ntheir general tendency.They may be in no danger of prosecution or\nimpeachment; but they are no less bound to bow to other signs of the\nwill of the House of Commons; the unwritten Constitution makes a\nvote of censure as effectual as an impeachment, and in many cases it\nmakes a mere refusal to pass a ministerial measure as effectual as a\nvote of censure.The written Law knows nothing of the Cabinet or the\nPrime Minister; it knows them as members of one or the other House of\nParliament, as Privy Councillors, as holders, each man in his own\nperson, of certain offices; but, as a collective body bound together\nby a common responsibility, the Law never heard of them(6).But in the\neye of the unwritten Constitution the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of\nwhich he is the head form the main feature of our system of government.It is plain at a moment\u2019s glance that the practical power of the Crown\nis not now what it was in the reign of William the Third or even in\nthat of George the Third.But the change is due, far less to changes in\nthe written Law than to changes in the unwritten Constitution.The Law\nleaves the powers of the Crown untouched, but the Constitution requires\nthat those powers should be exercised by such persons, and in such a\nmanner, as may be acceptable to a majority of the House of Commons.In\nall these ways, in a manner silent and indirect, the Lower House of\nParliament, as it is still deemed in formal rank, has become the really\nruling power in the nation.There is no greater contrast than that\nwhich exists between the humility of its formal dealings with the Crown\nand even with the Upper House(7), and the reality of the irresistible\npower which it exercises over both.It is so conscious of the mighty\nforce of its indirect powers that it no longer cares to claim the\ndirect powers which it exercised in former times.There was a time\nwhen Parliament was directly consulted on questions of War and Peace.There was a time when Parliament claimed directly to appoint several\nof the chief officers of state(8).There were much later times when it\nwas no unusual thing to declare a man in power to be a public enemy,\nor directly to address the Crown for his removal from office and from\nthe royal presence.No such direct exercises of parliamentary power are\nneeded now, because the whole machinery of government may be changed by\nthe simple process of the House refusing to pass a measure on which the\nMinister has made up his mind to stake his official being.Into the history of the stages by which this most remarkable state\nof things has been brought about I do not intend here to enter.The\ncode of our unwritten Constitution has, like all other English things,\ngrown up bit by bit, and, for the most part, silently and without any\nacknowledged author.Yet some stages of the developement are easily\npointed out, and they make important landmarks.The beginning may be\nplaced in the reign of William the Third, when we first find anything\nat all like a _Ministry_ in the modern sense.Up to that time the\nservants of the Crown had been servants of the Crown, each man in\nthe personal discharge of his own office.The holder of each office\nowed faithful service to the Crown, and he was withal responsible to\nthe Law; but he stood in no special fellowship towards the holder\nof any other office.Provided he discharged his own duties, nothing\nhindered him from being the personal or political enemy of any of his\nfellow-servants.It was William who first saw that, if the King\u2019s\ngovernment was to be carried on, there must be at least a general\nagreement of opinions and aims among the King\u2019s chief agents in his\ngovernment(9).From this beginning a system has gradually grown up\nwhich binds the chief officers of the Crown to work together in at\nleast outward harmony, to undertake the defence of one another, and\non vital points to stand and fall together.Another important stage\nhappened in much later times, when the King ceased to take a share in\nperson in the deliberations of his Cabinet.And I may mark a change\nin language which has happened within my own memory, and which, like\nother changes of language, is certainly not without its meaning.We\nnow familiarly speak, in Parliament and out of Parliament, of the body\nof Ministers actually in power, the body known to the Constitution but\nwholly unknown to the Law, by the name of \u201cthe Government.\u201d We speak\nof \u201cMr.Gladstone\u2019s Government\u201d or \u201cMr.Disraeli\u2019s Government.\u201d I can\nmyself remember the time when such a form of words was unknown, when\n\u201cGovernment\u201d still meant \u201cGovernment by King, Lords, and Commons,\u201d and\nwhen the body of men who acted as the King\u2019s immediate advisers were\nspoken of as \u201cMinisters\u201d or \u201cthe Ministry\u201d(10).This kind of silent, I might say stealthy, growth, has, without\nthe help of any legislative enactment, produced that unwritten\nand conventional code of political rules which we speak of as the\nConstitution.This process I have spoken of as being characteristic\nof the days since the Revolution of 1688, as distinguished from\nearlier times.At no earlier time have so\nmany important changes in constitutional doctrine and practice won\nuniversal acceptance without being recorded in any written enactment.Yet this tendency of later times is, after all, only a further\ndevelopement of a tendency which was at work from the beginning.It\nis simply another application of the Englishman\u2019s love of precedent.The growth of the unwritten Constitution has much in common with the\nearlier growth of the unwritten Common Law.I have shown in earlier\nchapters that some of the most important principles of our earlier\nConstitution were established silently and by the power of precedent,\nwithout resting on any known written enactment.If we cannot show any\nAct of Parliament determining the relations in which the members of\nthe Cabinet stand to the Crown, to the House of Commons, and to one\nanother, neither can we show the Act of Parliament which decreed, in\nopposition to the practice of all other nations, that the children of\nthe hereditary Peer should be simple Commoners.The real difference is\nthat, in more settled times, when Law was fully supreme, it was found\nthat many important practical changes might be made without formal\nchanges in the Law.It was also found that there is a large class of\npolitical subjects which can be better dealt with in this way of tacit\nunderstandings than they can be in the shape of a formal enactment by\nLaw.We practically understand what is meant by Ministers having or not\nhaving the confidence of the House of Commons; we practically recognise\nthe cases in which, as not having the confidence of the House, they\nought to resign office and the cases in which they may fairly appeal\nto the country by a dissolution of Parliament.But it would be utterly\nimpossible to define such cases beforehand in the terms of an Act of\nParliament.Or again, the Speaker of the House of Commons is an officer\nknown to the Law.The Leader of the House of Commons is a person as\nwell known to the House and the country, his functions are as well\nunderstood, as those of the Speaker himself.But of the Leader of the\nHouse of Commons the Law knows nothing.It would be hopeless to seek to\ndefine his duties in any legal form, and the House itself has, before\nnow, shrunk from recognising the existence of such a person in any\nshape of which a Court of Law could take notice(11).During a time then which is now not very far short of two hundred\nyears, the silent and extra-legal growth of our conventional\nConstitution has been at least as important as the actual changes\nin our written Law.With regard to these last, the point on which I\nwish chiefly to dwell is the way in which not a few pieces of modern\nlegislation have been\u2014whether wittingly or unwittingly I do not profess\nto know\u2014a return to the simpler principles of our oldest constitution.I trust to show that, in many important points, we have cast aside\nthe legal subtleties which grew up from the thirteenth century to the\nseventeenth, and that we have gone back to the plain common sense of\nthe eleventh or tenth, and of times far earlier still.In those ancient\ntimes we had already laws, but we had as yet no lawyers.We hear in\nearly times of men who were versed above others in the laws of the\nland; but such special knowledge is spoken of as the attribute of age\nor of experience in public business, not as the private possession of\na professional class(12).The class of professional lawyers grew up\nalong with the growth of a more complicated and technical jurisprudence\nunder our Norman and Angevin Kings.Now I mean no disrespect to\na profession which in our present artificial state of society we\ncertainly cannot do without, but there can be no kind of doubt that\nlawyers\u2019 interpretations and lawyers\u2019 ways of looking at things have\ndone no small mischief, not only to the true understanding of our\nhistory but to the actual course of our history itself.The lawyer\u2019s\ntendency is to carry to an unreasonable extent that English love of\nprecedent which, within reasonable bounds, is one of our most precious\nsafeguards.His virtue is that of acute and logical inference from\ngiven premisses; the premisses themselves he is commonly satisfied to\ntake without examination from those who have gone before him.It is\noften wonderful to see the amazing ingenuity with which lawyers have\npiled together inference upon inference, starting from some purely\narbitrary assumption of their own.Each stage of the argument, taken\nby itself, is absolutely unanswerable; the objection must be taken\nearlier, before the argument begins.The argument is perfect, if we\nonly admit the premisses; the only unlucky thing is that the premisses\nwill constantly be found to be historically worthless.Add to this that\nthe natural tendency of the legal mind is to conservatism and deference\nto authority.This will always be the case, even with thoroughly\nhonest men in an age when honesty is no longer dangerous.But this\ntendency will have tenfold force in times when an honest setting forth\nof the Law might expose its author to the disfavour of an arbitrary\ngovernment.We shall therefore find that the premisses from which\nlawyers\u2019 arguments have started, but which historical study shows to be\nunsound, are commonly premisses devised in favour of the prerogative\nof the Crown, not in favour of the rights of the people.Indeed the\nwhole ideal conception of the Sovereign, as one, personally at least,\nabove the Law, as one personally irresponsible and incapable of doing\nwrong, the whole conception of the Sovereign as the sole fountain of\nall honour, as the original grantor of all property, as the source\nfrom which all authority of every kind issues in the first instance,\nis purely a lawyer\u2019s conception, and rests upon no ground whatever in\nthe records of our early history(13).In later times indeed the evil\nhas largely corrected itself; the growth of our unwritten Constitution\nunder the hands of statesmen has done much practically to get rid of\nthese slavish devices of lawyers.The personal irresponsibility of the\nSovereign becomes practically harmless when the powers of the Crown are\nreally exercised by Ministers who act under a twofold responsibility,\nboth to the written Law and to the unwritten Constitution.Yet even\nnow small cases of hardship sometimes happen in which some traditional\nmaxim of lawyers, some device devised in favour of the prerogative of\nthe Crown, stands in the way of the perfectly equal administration\nof justice.But in several important cases the lawgiver has directly\nstepped in to wipe out the inventions of the lawyer, and modern Acts of\nParliament have brought things back to the simpler principles of our\nearliest forefathers.I will wind up my sketch of our constitutional\nhistory by pointing out several cases in which this happy result has\ntaken place.For many ages it was a legal doctrine universally received that\nParliament at once expired at the death of the reigning King.The\nargument by which the lawyers reached this conclusion is, like most of\ntheir arguments, altogether unanswerable, provided only we admit their\npremisses.According to the lawyers\u2019 conception, whatever might be the\npowers of Parliament when it actually came together, however much the\nKing might be bound to act by its advice, consent, and authority, the\nParliament itself did nevertheless derive its being from the authority\nof the King.Parliament was summoned by the King\u2019s writ.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.The King\nmight indeed be bound to issue the writs for its summons; still it was\nfrom the King\u2019s writ that the Parliament actually derived its being\nand its powers.By another legal assumption, the force of the King\u2019s\nwrit was held to last only during the lifetime of the King who issued\nit.It followed therefore that Parliament, summoned by the King\u2019s\nwrit and deriving its authority from the King\u2019s writ, was dissolved\n_ipso facto_ by the death of the King who summoned it.Once admit the\nassumptions from which this reasoning starts, and the reasoning itself\nis perfect.Let us see how\nthis mass of legal subtlety would have looked in the eyes of a man of\nthe eleventh century, in the eyes of a man who had borne his part in\nthe elections of Eadward and of Harold, and who had raised his voice\nand clashed his arms in the great Assembly which restored Godwine to\nhis lands and honours(14).To such an one the doctrine that a national\nAssembly could be gathered together only by the King\u2019s writ, and the\nconsequent doctrine that the national Assembly ceased to exist when the\nbreath went out of the King\u2019s body, would have seemed like the babble\nof a madman.When was the gathering together of the national Assembly\nmore needed, when was it called upon to exercise higher and more\ninherent powers, than when the throne was actually vacant, and when\nthe Assembly of the nation came together to determine who should fill\nit?And how could the Assembly be gathered together by the King\u2019s writ\nwhen there was no King in the land to issue a writ?<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.The King\u2019s writ\nwould be, in his eyes, a convenient way in ordinary times for fixing\na time and place for the meetings of the Assembly, but it would be\nnothing more.It would be in no sense the source of the powers of the\nAssembly, powers which he would look upon as derived from the simple\nfact that the Assembly was itself the nation.In his eyes it was not\nthe King who created the Assembly, but the Assembly which created the\nKing.The doctrine that the King never dies, that the throne never can\nbe vacant, would have seemed gibberish to one who had seen the throne\nvacant and had borne his part in filling it.The doctrine that the\nKing can do no wrong would have seemed no less gibberish to one who", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Three of the most famous Assemblies in English history have\never been puzzles in the eyes of mere legal interpreters; to the man of\nthe eleventh century they would have seemed to be perfectly legal and\nregular, alike in their constitution and in their acts.The Assembly\nwhich in 1399 deposed Richard the Second and elected Henry the Fourth,\nthough summoned by the King\u2019s writ, was not opened by his commission,\nand it seems to have shrunk from taking the name of Parliament, and to\nhave acted only by the name of the Estates of the Realm.As an Assembly\nwhich was in some sort irregular, it seems to have shrunk from going\nthrough the usual forms of a regular Parliament, and, though it did\nin the end exercise the greatest of parliamentary powers, it seems to\nhave been afraid to look its own act in the face.Richard was deposed,\nbut his deposition was mixed up with a resignation of the Crown on\nhis own part, and with a challenge of the Crown on the part of Henry.Then, as a demise of the Crown had taken place, it was held that the\nsame legal consequences followed as if that demise had been caused by\nthe death of the King.It was held that the Parliament which had been\nsummoned by the writ of King Richard ceased to exist when Richard\nceased to be King, and, as it was not thought good to summon a new\nParliament, the same Parliament was, by a legal fiction, summoned again\nunder the writ of King Henry(15).All these doubts and difficulties,\nall these subtleties of lawyers, would have been wholly unintelligible\nto a man of the eleventh century.In his eyes the Witan would have come\ntogether, whether by King Richard\u2019s writ or not it mattered little;\nhaving come together, they had done the two greatest of national acts\nby deposing one King and choosing another; having done this, if there\nwas any other national business to be done, there was no reason on\nearth why they should not go on and do it.Take again another Assembly\nof equal importance in our history, the Convention which voted the\nrecall\u2014that is, in truth, the election\u2014of Charles the Second.That\nAssembly succeeded a Parliament which had ventured on a still stronger\nstep than deposing a King, that of sending a reigning King to trial and\nexecution(16).It was not held in 1649 that the Long Parliament came\nto an end when the axe fell on the neck of Charles the First, but the\ndoctrine that it ought to have done so was not forgotten eleven years\nlater(17).And the Convention which was elected, as freely as any\nParliament ever was elected(18), in answer to the vote of the expiring\nLong Parliament, was, because it was so elected and not in answer to\nthe King\u2019s writ, looked on as an Assembly of doubtful validity.It\nacted as a Parliament; it restored the King; it granted him a revenue;\nand it did a more wonderful work than all, for it created itself, and\npassed an Act declaring itself to be a lawful Parliament(19).Yet,\nafter all, it was deemed safer that all the Acts of the Convention\nParliament should be confirmed by its successor which was summoned in\ndue form by the King\u2019s writ.These fantastic subtleties, subtleties\nworthy of the kindred device by which the first year of Charles\u2019s reign\nwas called the twelfth, would again have been wholly unintelligible\nto our man of the eleventh century.He might have remembered that the\nAssembly which restored \u00c6thelred\u2014which restored him on conditions,\nwhile Charles was restored without conditions\u2014did not scruple to go on\nand pass a series of the most important decrees that were passed in\nany of our early Assemblies(20).Once more again, the Convention which\ndeposed James and elected William, seemed, like that which deposed\nRichard and elected Henry, to doubt its own existence and to shrink\nfrom its own act.James was deposed; but the Assembly which deposed\nhim ventured not to use the word, and, as an extorted abdication was\ndeemed expedient in the case of Richard, so a constructive abdication\nwas imagined in the case of James(21).And the Assembly which elected\nWilliam, like the Assembly which elected Henry and that which elected\nCharles, prolonged its own existence by the same transparent fiction\nof voting itself to be a lawful Parliament.Wise men held at the time\nthat, at least in times of revolution, a Parliament might be called\ninto being by some other means than that of the writ of a King.Yet it\nwas deemed that some additional security was given to the existence of\nthe Assembly and to the validity of its acts by this second exercise\nof the mysterious power of self-creation(22).Once more in the same\nreign the question was brought forward whether a Parliament summoned\nby the joint writ of William and Mary did not expire when Mary died\nand William reigned alone.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.This subtlety was suggested only to be\ncontemptuously cast aside; yet it may be fairly doubted whether it was\nnot worth at least as much as any of the kindred subtleties which on\nthe three earlier occasions were deemed of such vast importance(23).The untutored wisdom of Englishmen, in the days when we had laws but\nwhen those laws had not yet been made the sport of the subtleties of\nlawyers, would have seen as little force in the difficulties which it\nwas deemed necessary to get over by solemn parliamentary enactments as\nin the difficulty which neither House of Parliament thought worthy of\nany serious discussion.And now what has modern legislation done towards getting rid of all\nthese pettifogging devices, and towards bringing us back to the simpler\ndoctrines of our forefathers?Parliament is still summoned by the\nwrit of the Sovereign; in settled times no other way of bringing it\ntogether can be so convenient.But, if times of revolution should ever\ncome again, we, who do even our revolutions according to precedent,\nshall probably have learned something from the revolutionary precedents\nof 1399, of 1660, and of 1688.In each later case the subtlety is\none degree less subtle than in the former.The Estates of the Realm\nwhich deposed Richard were changed into a Parliament of Henry by the\ntransparent fiction of sending out writs which were not, and could not\nbe, followed by any real elections.The Convention which recalled or\nelected Charles the Second did indeed turn itself into a Parliament,\nbut it was deemed needful that its acts should be confirmed by another\nParliament.The acts of the Convention of 1688 were not deemed to need\nany such confirmation.Each of these differences marks a stage in the\nreturn to the doctrine of common sense, that, convenient as it is in\nall ordinary times that Parliament should be summoned by the writ of\nthe Sovereign, yet it is not from that summons, but from the choice of\nthe people, that Parliament derives its real being and its inherent\npowers.As for the other end of the lawyers\u2019 doctrine, the inference\nthat Parliament is _ipso facto_ dissolved by a demise of the Crown,\nfrom that a more rational legislation has set us free altogether.Though modern Parliaments are no longer called on to elect Kings, yet\nexperience and common sense have taught us that the time when the\nSovereign is changed is exactly the time when the Great Council of\nthe Nation ought to be in full life and activity.By a statute only a\nfew years later than the raising of the question whether a Parliament\nof William and Mary did or did not expire by the death of Mary, all\nsuch subtleties were swept away.It was now deemed so needful that the\nnew Sovereign should have a Parliament ready to act with him, that it\nbecame the Law that the Parliament which was in being at the time of\na demise of the Crown should remain in being for six months, unless\nspecially dissolved by the new Sovereign.A later statute went further\nstill, and provided that, if a demise of the Crown should take place\nduring the short interval when there is no Parliament in being, the\nlast Parliament should _ipso facto_ revive, and should continue in\nbeing, unless a second time dissolved, for six months more.Thus the\nevent which, by the perverted ingenuity of lawyers, was held to have\nthe power of destroying a Parliament, was, by the wisdom of later\nlegislation, clothed with the power of calling a Parliament into being.Lastly, in our own days, all traces of the lawyers\u2019 superstition have\nbeen swept away, and the demise of the Crown now in no way affects the\nduration of the existing Parliament(24).Truly this is a case where\nthe letter killeth and the spirit giveth life.The doctrine which had\nbeen inferred by unanswerable logic from an utterly worthless premiss\nhas been cast aside in favour of the dictate of common sense.We have\nlearned that the moment when the State has lost its head is the last\nmoment which we ought to choose for depriving it of its body also.Here then is a notable instance of the way in which the latest\nlegislation of England has fallen back upon the principles of the\nearliest.Here is a point on which the eleventh century and the\nnineteenth are of one mind, and on which the fanciful scruples of the\nfourteenth and the seventeenth centuries are no longer listened to.In the old Teutonic Constitution, just as in\nthe old Roman Constitution, large tracts of land were the property of\nthe State, the _ager publicus_ of Rome, the _folkland_ of England.As\nthe royal power grew, as the King came to be more and more looked on\nas the impersonation of the nation, the land of the people came to be\nmore and more looked on as the land of the King, and the _folkland_\nof our Old-English charters gradually changed into the _Terra Regis_\nof Domesday(25).Like other changes of the kind, the Norman Conquest\nonly strengthened and brought to its full effect a tendency which was\nalready at work; but there can be no doubt that, down to the Norman\nConquest, the King at least went through the form of consulting his\nWitan, before he alienated the land of the people to become the\npossession of an individual\u2014in Old-English phrase, before he turned\n_folkland_ into _bookland_(26).After the Norman Conquest we hear no\nmore of the land of the people; it has become the land of the King, to\nbe dealt with according to the King\u2019s personal pleasure.From the days\nof the first William to those of the Third, the land which had once\nbeen the land of the people was dealt with without any reference to\nthe will of the people.Under a conscientious King it might be applied\nto the real service of the State, or bestowed as the reward of really\nfaithful servants of the State.Under an unconscientious King it might\nbe squandered broadcast among his minions or his mistresses(27).A custom as strong as law now requires\nthat, at the beginning of each fresh reign, the Sovereign shall, not\nby an act of bounty but by an act of justice, give back to the nation\nthe land which the nation lost so long ago.The royal demesnes are now\nhanded over to be dealt with like the other revenues of the State, to\nbe disposed of by Parliament for the public service(28).<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.That is to\nsay, the people have won back their own; the usurpation of the days of\nforeign rule has been swept away.We have in this case too gone back\nto the sound principles of our forefathers; the _Terra Regis_ of the\nNorman has once more become the _folkland_ of the days of our earliest\nfreedom.I will quote another case, a case in which the return from the\nfantasies of lawyers to the common sense of antiquity has been\ndistinctly to the profit, if not of the abstraction called the Crown,\nyet certainly to that of its personal holder.As long as the _folkland_\nremained the land of the people, as long as our monarchy retained\nits ancient elective character, the King, like any other man, could\ninherit, purchase, bequeath, or otherwise dispose of, the lands which\nwere his own private property as much as the lands of other men were\ntheirs.We have the wills of several of our early Kings which show that\na King was in this respect as free as any other man(29).But as the\nlawyers\u2019 figment of hereditary right took root, as the other lawyers\u2019\nfigment also took root by which the lands of the people were held to\nbe at the personal disposal of the King, a third figment grew up, by\nwhich it was held that the person and the office of the King were so\ninseparably fused into one that any private estates which the King held\nbefore his accession to the throne became _ipso facto_ part and parcel\nof the royal demesne.As long as the Crown remained an elective office,\nthe injustice of such a rule would have made itself plain; it would\nhave been at once seen to be as unreasonable as if it had been held\nthat the private estates of a Bishop should merge in the estates of\nhis see.As long as there was no certainty that the children or other\nheirs of the reigning King would ever succeed to his Crown, it would\nhave been the height of injustice to deprive them in this way of their\nnatural inheritance.The election of a King would have carried with\nit the confiscation of his private estate.But when the Crown was held\nto be hereditary, when the _folkland_ was held to be _Terra Regis_,\nthis hardship was no longer felt.The eldest son was provided for by\nhis right of succession to the Crown, and the power of disposing of the\nCrown lands at pleasure gave the King the means of providing for his\nyounger children.Still the doctrine was none the less unreasonable;\nit was a doctrine founded on no ground either of natural justice or of\nancient law; it was a mere inference which had gradually grown up out\nof mere arbitrary theories about the King\u2019s powers and prerogatives.And, as the old state of things gradually came back again, as men\nbegan to feel that the demesnes of the Crown were not the private\npossession of the reigning King, but were the true possession of the\npeople\u2014that is, as the _Terra Regis_ again came back to its old state\nof _folkland_\u2014it was felt to be unreasonable to shut out the Sovereign\nfrom a natural right which belonged to every one of his subjects.The\nland which, to put it in the mildest form, the King held in trust for\nthe common service of the nation was now again employed to its proper\nuse.It was therefore reasonable that a restriction which belonged\nto a past state of things should be swept away, and that Sovereigns\nwho had given up an usurped power which they ought never to have held\nshould be restored to the enjoyment of a natural right which ought\nnever to have been taken from them.As our present Sovereign in so many\nother respects holds the place of \u00c6lfred rather than the place of the\nRichards and Henries of later times, so she again holds the right which\n\u00c6lfred held, of acquiring and disposing of private property like any\nother member of the nation(30).These examples are, I hope, enough to make out my case.In each of them\nmodern legislation has swept away the arbitrary inferences of lawyers,\nand has gone back to those simpler principles which the untutored\nwisdom of our forefathers never thought of calling in question.I\ncould easily make the list much longer.Every act which has restrained\nthe arbitrary prerogative of the Crown, every act which has secured\nor increased either the powers of Parliament or the liberty of the\nsubject, has been a return, sometimes to the letter, at all times to\nthe spirit, of our earliest Law.But I would enlarge on one point\nonly, the most important point of all, and a point in which we may\nat first sight seem, not to have come nearer, but to have gone away\nfurther from the principles of early times.I mean with regard to the\nsuccession to the Crown.The Crown was of old, as I have already said,\nelective.No man had a right to become King till he had been called\nto the kingly office by the choice of the Assembly of the nation.No\nman actually was King till he had been admitted to the kingly office\nby the consecration of the Church.The doctrines that the King never\ndies, that the throne never can be vacant, that there can be no\ninterregnum, that the reign of the next heir begins the moment the\nreign of his predecessor is ended, are all figments of later times.No signs of such doctrines can be found at any time earlier than the\naccession of Edward the First(31).The strong preference which in early\ntimes belonged to members of the kingly house, above all to the born\nson of a crowned King(32), gradually grew, under the influences which\nthe Norman Conquest finally confirmed, into the doctrine of absolute\nhereditary right.That doctrine grew along with the general growth of\nthe royal power; it grew as men gradually came to look on kingship as\na possession held by a single man for his own profit, rather than as\nan office bestowed by the people for the common good of the realm.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.It\nmight seem that, in this respect at least, we have not gone forward,\nbut that we rather have gone back.For nothing is more certain than\nthat the Crown is more strictly and undoubtedly hereditary now than it\nwas in the days of Normans, Angevins, or Tudors.But a little thought\nwill show that in this case also, we have not gone back but have gone\nforward.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.That is to say, we have gone forward by going back, by going\nback, in this case, not to the letter, but assuredly to the spirit of\nearlier times.The Crown is now more undoubtedly hereditary than it\nwas in the fifteenth or sixteenth century; but this is because it is\nnow hereditary by Law, because its powers are distinctly defined by\nLaw.The will of the people, the source of all Law and of all power,\nhas been exercised, not in the old form of personally choosing a King\nat every vacancy of the Crown, but by an equally lawful exercise of\nthe national will, which has thought good to entail the Crown on a\nparticular family.It was in the reign of our last elective King that the Crown first\nbecame legally hereditary.The doctrine may seem a startling one, but\nit is one to which an unbiassed study of our history will undoubtedly\nlead us.Few things are more amusing than the treatment which our early\nhistory has met with at the hands of purely legal writers.There is\nsomething almost pitiable in the haltings and stumblings of such a\nwriter as Blackstone, unable to conceive that his lawyer\u2019s figment\nof hereditary right was anything short of eternal, and yet coming at\nevery moment across events which showed that in early times all such\nfigments were utterly unknown(33).In early times the King was not\nonly elected, but he went through a twofold election.I have already\nsaid that the religious character with which most nations have thought\ngood to clothe their Kings took in England, as in most other Christian\nlands, the form of an ecclesiastical consecration to the kingly office.That form we still retain; but in modern times it has become a mere\nform, a pageant impressive no doubt and instructive, but still a mere\npageant, which gives the crowned King no powers which he did not\nequally hold while still uncrowned.The death of the former King at\nonce puts his successor in possession of every kingly right and power;\nhis coronation in no way adds to his legal authority, however much it\nmay add to his personal responsibility towards God and his people.But\nthis was not so of old time.The choice of the national Assembly gave\nthe King so chosen the sole right to become King, but it did not make\nhim King.The recommendation\nof the Crown, the election of the Chapter, and the confirmation of the\nArchbishop, give a certain man the sole right to a certain see, but\nit is only the purely religious rite of consecration which makes him\nactually Bishop of it(34).The choice\nof the Witan made him King-elect, but it was only the ecclesiastical\ncrowning and anointing which made him King.And this ecclesiastical\nceremony involved a further election.Chosen already to the civil\noffice by the Nation in its civil character, he was again chosen by\nthe Church\u2014that is, by the Nation in its religious character, by the\nClergy and People assembled in the church where the crowning rite was\nto be done(35).This second ecclesiastical election must always have\nbeen a mere form, as the choice of the nation was already made before\nthe ecclesiastical ceremony began.But the ecclesiastical election\nsurvived the civil one.The state of things which lawyers dream of\nfrom the beginning is a law of strict hereditary succession, broken\nin upon by occasional interruptions.These interruptions, which, in\nthe eye of history, are simply exercises of an ancient right, are, in\nthe eyes of lawyers, only revolutions or usurpations.But this state\nof things, a state in which a fixed rule was sometimes broken, which\nBlackstone dreams of in the tenth and eleventh centuries, really did\nexist from the thirteenth century onwards.From the accession of\nEdward the First, the first King who reigned before his coronation,\nhereditary succession became the rule in practice.The son, or even the\ngrandson, of the late King(36) was commonly acknowledged as a matter\nof course, without anything which could fairly be called an election.But the right of Parliament to settle the succession was constantly\nexercised, and ever and anon we come across signs which show that\nthe ancient notion of an election of a still more popular kind had\nnot wholly passed away out of men\u2019s minds.Two Kings were formally\ndeposed, and on the deposition of the second the Crown passed, as\nit might have done in ancient times, to a branch of the royal house\nwhich was not the next in lineal succession.Three Kings of the House\nof Lancaster reigned by a good parliamentary title, and the doctrine\nof indefeasible hereditary right, the doctrine that there was some\nvirtue in a particular line of succession which the power of Parliament\nitself could not set aside, was first brought forward as the formal\njustification of the claims of the House of York(37).<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.Those claims\nin truth could not be formally justified on any showing but that of\nthe most slavish doctrine of divine right, but it was not on any such\ndoctrine as that that the cause of the House of York really rested.The elaborate list of grandmothers and great-grandmothers which was\nbrought forward to show that Henry the Fifth was an usurper would never\nhave been heard of if the government of Henry the Sixth had not become\nutterly unpopular, while Richard Duke of York was the best beloved man\nof his time.Richard accepted a parliamentary compromise, which of\ncourse implied the right of Parliament to decide the question.Henry\nwas to keep the Crown for life, and Richard was to displace Henry\u2019s\nson as heir-apparent.That is to say, according to a custom common in\nGermany, though rare in England, Richard was chosen to fill a vacancy\nin the throne which had not yet taken place(38).Duke Richard fell at\nWakefield; in the Yorkist reading of the Law the Crown was presently\nforfeited by Henry, and Edward, the heir of York, had his claim\nacknowledged by a show of popular election which carries us back to\nfar earlier times.The claim of Richard the Third, whatever we make\nof it on other grounds, was acknowledged in the like sort by what had\nat least the semblance of a popular Assembly(39).In short, though\nthe hereditary principle had now taken firm root, though the disputes\nbetween the pretenders to the Crown were mainly disputes as to the\nright of succession, yet the remembrance of the days when the Crown\nhad been truly the gift of the people had not wholly passed away.The last King who could bring even the shadow of a claim to have\nbeen chosen by the voice of the people beneath the canopy of heaven\nwas no other than Richard the Third.The last King who could bring\na better claim to have been chosen by the same voice beneath the\nvault of the West Minster was no other than Henry the Eighth.Down to\nhis time the old ecclesiastical form of choosing the King remained\nin the coronation-service, and it was not wholly out of character\nthat Henry should issue a _cong\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lire_ for his own election.The\ndevice for Henry\u2019s coronation survives in his own handwriting, and,\nwhile it contains a strong assertion of his hereditary right, it also\ncontains a distinct provision for his election by the people in ancient\nform(40).The claim of Henry was perfectly good, for a Parliament of\nhis father\u2019s reign had declared that the Crown should abide in Henry\nthe Seventh and the heirs of his body(41).On hearing that, Hera Lall again came to the\nfront with clasped hands, saying: \"O my Lord, if one cart of biscuits\nshort, Major Fitzgerald not listen to me, but will order thirty lashes\nwith provost-marshal's cat!What can a poor _baboo_ do with such wild\nHighlanders?\"Sir Colin replied: \"Yes, _baboo_, I know these Highlanders\nare very wild fellows when hungry; let them have the biscuits;\" and\nturning to one of the staff, he directed him to give a voucher to the\n_baboo_ that a cart loaded with biscuits had broken down and the\ncontents had been divided among the rear-guard by order of the\nCommander-in-Chief.Sir Colin then turned to us and said: \"Men, I give\nyou the biscuits; divide them with your comrades in front; but you must\npromise me should a cart loaded with rum break down, you will not\ninterfere with it.\"We all replied: \"No, no, Sir Colin, if rum breaks\ndown we'll not touch it.\"\"All right,\" said Sir Colin, \"remember I trust\nyou,\" and looking round he said, \"I know every one of you,\" and rode on.We very soon found room for the biscuits, until we got up to the rest of\nthe company, when we honestly shared them.I may add that _baboo_ Hera\nLall Chatterjee is still living, and is the only native employe I know\nwho served through the second relief of Lucknow.He now holds the post\nof cashier in the offices of Messrs.McNeill and Co., of Clive Ghat\nStreet, Calcutta, which doubtless he finds more congenial employment\nthan defending commissariat stores from hungry wild Highlanders, with\nthe prospect of the provost-marshal's cat as the only reward for doing\nhis best to defend his charge.About five miles farther on a general halt was made for a short rest and\nfor all stragglers to come up.Sir Colin himself, being still with the\ncolumn, ordered the Ninety-Third to form up, and, calling the officers\nto the front, he made the first announcement to the regiment that\nGeneral Wyndham had been attacked by the Nana Sahib and the Gwalior\nContingent in Cawnpore; that his force had been obliged to retire within\nthe fort at the head of the bridge of boats, and that we must reach\nCawnpore that night, because, if the bridge of boats should be captured\nbefore we got there, we would be cut off in Oude with fifty thousand of\nour enemies in our rear, a well-equipped army of forty thousand men,\nwith a powerful train of artillery numbering over forty siege guns, in\nour front, and with all the women and children, sick and wounded, to\nguard.\"So, Ninety-Third,\" said the grand old Chief, \"I don't ask you to\nundertake this forced march, in your present tired condition, without\ngood reason.You must reach Cawnpore to-night at all costs.\"And, as\nusual, when he took the men into his confidence, he was answered from\nthe ranks, \"All right, Sir Colin, we'll do it.\"To which he replied,\n\"Very well, Ninety-Third, remember I depend on you.\"And he and his\nstaff and escort rode on.By this time we could plainly hear the guns of the Gwalior Contingent\nbombarding General Wyndham's position in Cawnpore; and although terribly\nfootsore and tired, not having had our clothes off, nor a change of\nsocks, since the 10th of the month (now eighteen days) we trudged on our\nweary march, every mile making the roar of the guns in front more\naudible.I may remark here that there is nothing to rouse tired soldiers\nlike a good cannonade in front; it is the best tonic out!Even the\nyoungest soldier who has once been under fire, and can distinguish the\nsound of a shotted gun from blank, pricks up his ears at the sound and\nsteps out with a firmer tread and a more erect bearing.I shall never forget the misery of that march!However, we reached the\nsands on the banks of the Ganges, on the Oude side of the river opposite\nCawnpore, just as the sun was setting, having covered the forty-seven\nmiles under thirty hours.Of course the great hardship of the march was\ncaused by our worn-out state after eighteen days' continual duty,\nwithout a change of clothes or our accoutrements off.And when we got in\nsight of Cawnpore, the first thing we saw was the enemy on the opposite\nside of the river from us, making bonfires of our spare kits and baggage\nwhich had been left at Cawnpore when we advanced for the relief of\nLucknow!Tired as we were, we assisted to drag Peel's heavy guns into\nposition on the banks of the river, whence the Blue-jackets opened fire\non the left flank of the enemy, the bonfires of our spare baggage being\na fine mark for them.Just as the Nana Sahib had got his first gun to bear on the bridge of\nboats, that gun was struck on the side by one of Peel's 24-pounders and\nupset, and an 8-inch shell from one of his howitzers bursting in the\nmidst of a crowd of them, we could see them bolting helter-skelter.This put a stop to their game for the night, and we lay down and rested\non the sands till daybreak next morning, the 29th of November.I must mention here an experience of my own which I always recall to\nmind when I read some of the insane ravings of the Anti-Opium Society\nagainst the use of that drug.I was so completely tired out by that\nterrible march that after I had lain down for about half an hour I\npositively could not stand up, I was so stiff and worn out.Having been\non duty as orderly corporal before leaving the Alumbagh, I had been much\nlonger on my feet than the rest of the men; in fact, I was tired out\nbefore we started on our march on the afternoon of the 27th, and now,\nafter having covered forty-seven miles under thirty hours, my condition\ncan be better imagined than described.After I became cold, I grew so\nstiff that I positively could not use my legs.Now Captain Dawson had a\nnative servant, an old man named Hyder Khan, who had been an officers'\nservant all his life, and had been through many campaigns.I had made a\nfriend of old Hyder before we left Chinsurah, and he did not forget me.Having ridden the greater part of the march on the camel carrying his\nmaster's baggage, Hyder was comparatively fresh when he got into camp,\nand about the time our canteen-sergeant got up and was calling for\norderly-corporals to draw grog for the men, old Hyder came looking for\nme, and when he saw my tired state, he said, in his camp English:\n\"Corporal _sahib_, you God-damn tired; don't drink grog.Old Hyder give\nyou something damn much better than grog for tired mans.\"With that he\nwent away, but shortly after returned, and gave me a small pill, which\nhe told me was opium, and about half a pint of hot tea, which he had\nprepared for himself and his master.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.I swallowed the pill and drank the\ntea, and _in less than ten minutes_ I felt myself so much refreshed as\nto be able to get up and draw the grog for the men of the company and to\nserve it out to them while the colour-sergeant called the roll.I then\nlay down, rolled up in my sepoy officer's quilt, which I had carried\nfrom the Shah Nujeef, and had a sound refreshing sleep till next\nmorning, and then got up so much restored that, except for the sores on\nmy feet from broken blisters, I could have undertaken another forty-mile\nmarch.I always recall this experience when I read many of the ignorant\narguments of the Anti-Opium Society, who would, if they had the power,\ncompel the Government to deprive every hard-worked _coolie_ of the only\nsolace in his life of toil.I am certainly not an opium-eater, and the\nabuse of opium may be injurious, as is the abuse of anything; but I am\nso convinced in my own mind of the beneficial effects of the temperate\nuse of the drug, that if I were the general of an army after a forced\nmarch like that of the retreat from Lucknow to the relief of Cawnpore, I\nwould make the Medical Department give every man a pill of opium and\nhalf a pint of hot tea, instead of rum or liquor of any sort!I hate\ndrunkenness as much as anybody, but I have no sympathy with what I may\ncall the intemperate temperance of most of our teetotallers and the\nAnti-Opium Society.My experience has been as great and as varied as\nthat of most Europeans in India, and that experience has led me to the\nconviction that the members of the Anti-Opium Society are either\nculpably ignorant of facts, or dishonest in the way they represent what\nthey wish others to believe to be facts.Most of the assertions made\nabout the Government connection with opium being a hindrance to\nmission-work and the spread of Christianity, are gross exaggerations not\nborne out by experience, and the opium slave", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "But I shall have\nsome more observations to make on this score elsewhere, and some\nevidence to bring forward in support of them.[28]\n\nEarly on the morning of the 29th of November the Ninety-Third crossed\nthe bridge of boats, and it was well that Sir Colin had returned so\npromptly from Lucknow to the relief of Cawnpore, for General Wyndham's\ntroops were not only beaten and cowed,--they were utterly demoralised.When the Commander-in-Chief left Cawnpore for Lucknow, General Wyndham,\nknown as the \"Hero of the Redan,\" was left in command at Cawnpore with\ninstructions to strengthen his position by every means, and to detain\nall detachments arriving from Calcutta after the 10th of November,\nbecause it was known that the Gwalior Contingent were in great force\nsomewhere across the Jumna, and there was every probability that they\nwould either attack Cawnpore, or cross into Oude to fall on the rear of\nthe Commander-in-Chief's force to prevent the relief of Lucknow.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.But\nstrict orders were given to General Wyndham that he was _on no account_\nto move out of Cawnpore, should the Gwalior Contingent advance on his\nposition, but to act on the defensive, and to hold his entrenchments and\nguard the bridge of boats at all hazards.By that time the entrenchment\nor mud fort at the Cawnpore end of the bridge, where the Government\nHarness and Saddlery Factory now stands, had become a place of\nconsiderable strength under the able direction of Captain Mowbray\nThomson, one of the four survivors of General Wheeler's force.Captain\nThomson had over four thousand _coolies_ daily employed on the defences\nfrom daybreak till dark, and he was a most energetic officer himself, so\nthat by the time we passed through Cawnpore for the relief of Lucknow\nthis position had become quite a strong fortification, especially when\ncompared with the miserable apology for an entrenchment so gallantly\ndefended by General Wheeler's small force and won from him by such black\ntreachery.When we advanced for the relief of Lucknow, all our spare\nbaggage, five hundred new tents, and a great quantity of clothing for\nthe troops coming down from Delhi, were shut up in Cawnpore, with a\nlarge quantity of spare ammunition, harness, and saddlery; in brief,\nproperty to the value of over five _lakhs_ of rupees was left stored in\nthe church and in the houses which were still standing near the church\nbetween the town and the river, a short distance from the house in which\nthe women and children were murdered.All this property, as already\nmentioned, fell into the hands of the Gwalior Contingent, and we\nreturned just in time to see them making bonfires of what they could not\nuse.Colonel Sir Robert Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala) lost\nall the records of his long service, and many valuable engineering\npapers which could never be replaced.As for us of the Ninety-Third, we\nlost all our spare kits, and were now without a chance of a change of\nunderclothing or socks.Let all who may read this consider what it meant\nto us, who had not changed our clothes from the 10th of the month, and\nhow, on the morning of the 29th, the sight of the enemy making bonfires\nof our kits, just as we were within reach of them, could hardly have\nbeen soothing to contemplate.But to return to General Wyndham's force.By the 26th of November it\nnumbered two thousand four hundred men, according to Colonel Adye's\n_Defence of Cawnpore_; and when he heard of the advance of the Nana\nSahib at the head of the Gwalior Contingent, Wyndham considered himself\nstrong enough to disobey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, and moved\nout of his entrenchment to give them battle, encountering their advance\nguard at Pandoo Nuddee about seven miles from Cawnpore.He at once\nattacked and drove it back through a village in its rear; but behind\nthe village he found himself confronted by an army of over forty\nthousand men, twenty-five thousand of them being the famous Gwalior\nContingent, the best disciplined troops in India, which had never been\nbeaten and considered themselves invincible, and which, in addition to a\nsiege train of thirty heavy guns, 24 and 32-pounders, had a\nwell-appointed and well-drilled field-artillery.General Wyndham now saw\nhis mistake, and gave the order for retreat.His small force retired in\ngood order, and encamped on the plain outside Cawnpore on the Bithoor\nroad for the night, to find itself outflanked and almost surrounded by\nTantia Topee and his Mahrattas on the morning of the 27th; and at the\nend of five hours' fighting a general retreat into the fort had again to\nbe ordered.The retiring force was overwhelmed by a murderous cannonade, and, being\nlargely composed of young soldiers, a panic ensued.The men got out of\nhand, and fled for the fort with a loss of over three hundred,--mostly\nkilled, because the wounded who fell into the hands of the enemy were\ncut to pieces,--and several guns.Moore, Church of England\nChaplain with General Wyndham's force, gave a very sad picture of the\npanic in which the men fled for the fort, and his description was borne\nout by what I saw myself when we passed through the fort on the morning\nof the 29th.Moore said: \"The men got quite out of hand and fled\npell-mell for the fort.An old Sikh _sirdar_ at the gate tried to stop\nthem, and to form them up in some order, and when they pushed him aside\nand rushed past him, he lifted up his hands and said, 'You are not the\nbrothers of the men who beat the Khalsa army and conquered the Punjab!'\"Moore went on to say that, \"The old Sikh followed the flying men\nthrough the Fort Gate, and patting some of them on the back said, 'Don't\nrun, don't be afraid, there is nothing to hurt you!'\"The fact is the\nmen were mostly young soldiers, belonging to many different regiments,\nsimply battalions of detachments.They were crushed by the heavy and\nwell-served artillery of the enemy, and if the truth must be told, they\nhad no confidence in their commander, who was a brave soldier, but no\ngeneral; so when the men were once seized with panic, there was no\nstopping them.The only regiment, or rather part of a regiment, for they\nonly numbered fourteen officers of all ranks and a hundred and sixty\nmen, which behaved well, was the old Sixty-Fourth, and two companies of\nthe Thirty-Fourth and Eighty-Second, making up a weak battalion of\nbarely three hundred.This was led by brave old Brigadier Wilson, who\nheld them in hand until he brought them forward to cover the retreat,\nwhich he did with a loss of seven officers killed and two wounded,\neighteen men of the Sixty-Fourth killed and twenty-five wounded, with\nequally heavy proportions killed and wounded from the companies of the\nThirty-Fourth and Eighty-Second.Brigadier Wilson first had his horse\nshot, and was then himself killed, while urging the men to maintain the\nhonour of the regiment.The command then devolved on Major Stirling,\none of the Sixty-Fourth, who was cut down in the act of spiking one of\nthe enemy's guns, and Captain M'Crea of the same regiment was also cut\ndown just as he had spiked his fourth gun.This charge, and these\nindividual acts of bravery, retarded the advance of the enemy till some\nsort of order had been re-established inside the fort.The Sixty-Fourth\nwere then driven back, and obliged to leave their dead.This then was the state of matters when we reached Cawnpore from\nLucknow.The whole of our spare baggage was captured: the city of\nCawnpore and the whole of the river-side up to the house where the Nana\nhad slaughtered the women and children were in the hands of the enemy;\nbut they had not yet injured the bridge of boats, nor crossed the canal,\nand the road to Allahabad still remained open.We marched through the fort, and took up ground near where the jute mill\nof Messrs.We\ncrossed the bridge without any loss except one officer, who was slightly\nwounded by being struck on the shin by a spent bullet from a charge of\ngrape.He was a long slender youth of about sixteen or seventeen years\nof age, whom the men had named \"Jack Straw.\"He was knocked down just as\nwe cleared the bridge of boats, among the blood of some camp-followers\nwho had been killed by the bursting of a shell just in front of us.Sergeant Paton, of my company, picked him up, and put him into an empty\n_dooly_ which was passing.During the day a piquet of one sergeant, one corporal, and about twenty\nmen, under command of Lieutenant Stirling, who was afterwards killed on\nthe 5th of December, was sent out to bring in the body of Brigadier\nWilson, and a man named Doran, of the Sixty-Fourth, who had gone up to\nLucknow in the Volunteer Cavalry, and had there done good service and\nreturned with our force, volunteered to go out with them to identify the\nbrigadier's body, because there were many more killed near the same\nplace, and their corpses having been stripped, they could not be\nidentified by their uniform, and it would have been impossible to have\nbrought in all without serious loss.The party reached the brigadier's\nbody without apparently attracting the attention of the enemy; but just\nas two men, Rule of my regiment and Patrick Doran, were lifting it into\nthe _dooly_ they were seen, and the enemy opened fire on them.A bullet\nstruck Doran and went right through his body from side to side, without\ntouching any of the vital organs, just as he was bending down to lift\nthe brigadier--a most extraordinary wound!If the bullet had deviated a\nhair's-breadth to either side, the wound must have been mortal, but\nDoran was able to walk back to the fort, and lived for many years after\ntaking his discharge from the regiment.During the time that this piquet was engaged the Blue-jackets of Peel's\nBrigade and our heavy artillery had taken up positions in front of the\nfort, and showed the gunners of the Gwalior Contingent that they were no\nlonger confronted by raw inexperienced troops.By the afternoon of the\n29th of November, the whole of the women and children and sick and\nwounded from Lucknow had crossed the Ganges, and encamped behind the\nNinety-Third on the Allahabad road, and here I will leave them and close\nthis chapter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[27] Native cavalry troopers.[28] See Appendix D.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nANECDOTES--ACTION WITH THE GWALIOR CONTINGENT--ITS DEFEAT--PURSUIT OF\nTHE NANA--BITHOOR--JOHN LANG AND JOTEE PERSHAD\n\n\nSo far as I now remember, the 30th of November, 1857, passed without any\nmovement on the part of the enemy, and the Commander-in-Chief, in his\nletter describing the state of affairs to the Governor-General, said, \"I\nam obliged to submit to the hostile occupation of Cawnpore until the\nactual despatch of all my incumbrances towards Allahabad is effected.\"As stated in the last chapter, when our tents came up our camp was\npitched (as near as I can now make out from the altered state of\nCawnpore), about the spot where Joe Lee's hotel and the jute mill of\nMessrs.Andrew's day and evening\npassed without molestation, except that strong piquets lined the canal\nand guarded our left and rear from surprise, and the men in camp slept\naccoutred, ready to turn out at the least alarm.But during the night,\nor early on the morning of the 1st of December, the enemy had quietly\nadvanced some guns, unseen by our piquets, right up to the Cawnpore side\nof the canal, and suddenly opened fire on the Ninety-Third just as we\nwere falling in for muster-parade, sending round-shot and shell right\nthrough our tents.One shrapnel shell burst right in the centre of\nCaptain Cornwall's company severely wounding the captain,\nColour-Sergeant M'Intyre, and five men, but not killing any one.Captain Cornwall was the oldest officer in the regiment, even an older\nsoldier than Colonel Leith-Hay who had then commanded it for over three\nyears, and for long he had been named by the men \"Old Daddy Cornwall.\"He was poor, and had been unable to purchase promotion, and in\nconsequence was still a captain with over thirty-five years' service.The bursting of the shell right over his head stunned the old gentleman,\nand a bullet from it went through his shoulder breaking his collar-bone\nand cutting a deep furrow down his back.The old man was rather stout\nand very short-sighted; the shock of the fall stunned him for some time,\nand before he regained his senses Dr.Munro had cut the bullet out of\nhis back and bandaged up his wound as well as possible.Daddy came to\nhimself just as the men were lifting him into a _dooly_.Munro standing by with the bullet in his hand, about to present it to\nhim as a memento of Cawnpore, Daddy gasped out, \"Munro, is my wound\ndangerous?\"\"No, Cornwall,\" was the answer, \"not if you don't excite\nyourself into a fever; you will get over it all right.\"The next\nquestion put was, \"Is the road clear to Allahabad?\"To which Munro\nreplied that it was, and that he hoped to have all the sick and wounded\nsent down country within a day or two.\"Then by----\" said Daddy, with\nconsiderable emphasis, \"I'm off.\"The poor old fellow had through long\ndisappointment become like our soldiers in Flanders,--he sometimes\nswore; but considering how promotion had passed over him, that was\nperhaps excusable.All this occupied far less time than it takes to\nwrite it, and I may as well here finish the history of Daddy Cornwall\nbefore I leave him.He went home in the same vessel as a rich widow,\nwhom he married on arrival in Dublin, his native place, the corporation\nof which presented him with a valuable sword and the freedom of the\ncity.The death of Brigadier-General Hope in the following April gave\nCaptain Cornwall his majority without purchase, and he returned to India\nin the end of 1859 to command the regiment for about nine months,\nretiring from the army in 1860, when we lay at Rawul Pindee.Being shelled out of our tents, the\nregiment was advanced to the side of the canal under cover of the mud\nwalls of what had formerly been the sepoy lines, in which we took\nshelter from the fire of the enemy.Later in the day Colonel Ewart lost\nhis left arm by a round-shot striking him on the elbow just as he had\ndismounted from his charger on his return from visiting the piquets on\nthe left and rear of our position, he being the field-officer for the\nday.This caused universal regret in the regiment, Ewart being the most\npopular officer in it.By the evening of the 3rd of December the whole of the women and\nchildren, and as many of the wounded as could bear to be moved, were on\ntheir way to Allahabad; and during the 4th and 5th reinforcements\nreached Cawnpore from England, among them our old comrades of the\nForty-Second whom we had left at Dover in May.We were right glad to see\nthem, on the morning of the 5th December, marching in with bagpipes\nplaying, which was the first intimation we had of another Highland\nregiment being near us.These reinforcements raised the force under Sir\nColin Campbell to five thousand infantry, six hundred cavalry, and\nthirty-five guns.Early on the morning of the 6th of December we struck our tents, which\nwere loaded on elephants, and marched to a place of safety behind the\nfort on the river bank, whilst we formed up in rear of the unroofed\nbarracks--the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninety-Third, and Fourth Punjab\nInfantry, with Peel's Brigade and several batteries of artillery, among\nthem Colonel Bourchier's light field-battery (No.17 of the old\nCompany's European artillery), a most daring lot of fellows, the Ninth\nLancers, and one squadron of Hodson's Horse under command of Lieutenant\nGough,[29] a worthy pupil of a famous master.This detachment of\nHodson's Horse had come down with Sir Hope Grant from Delhi, and served\nat the final relief of Lucknow and the retreat to the succour of\nCawnpore.The headquarters of the regiment under its famous commander\nhad been left with Brigadier Showers.As this force was formed up in columns, masked from the view of the\nenemy by the barracks on the plain of Cawnpore, the Commander-in-Chief\nrode up, and told us that he had just got a telegram informing him of\nthe safe arrival of the women and children, sick and wounded, at\nAllahabad, and that now we were to give battle to the famous Gwalior\nContingent, consisting of twenty-five thousand well-disciplined troops,\nwith about ten thousand of the Nana Sahib's Mahrattas and all the\n_budmashes_ of Cawnpore, Calpee, and Gwalior, under command of the Nana\nin person, who had proclaimed himself Peishwa and Chief of the Mahratta\npower, with Tantia Topee, Bala Sahib (the Nana's brother), and Raja Koor\nSing, the Rajpoot Chief of Judgdespore, as divisional commanders, and\nwith all the native officers of the Gwalior Contingent as brigade and\nregimental commanders.Sir Colin also warned us that there was a large\nquantity of rum in the enemy's camp, which we must carefully avoid,\nbecause it was reported to have been drugged.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.\"But, Ninety-Third,\" he\ncontinued, \"I trust you.The supernumerary rank will see that no man\nbreaks the ranks, and I have ordered the rum to be destroyed as soon as\nthe camp is taken.\"The Chief then rode on to the other regiments and as soon as he had\naddressed a short speech to each, a signal was sent up from Peel's\nrocket battery, and General Wyndham opened the ball on his side with\nevery gun at his disposal, attacking the enemy's left between the city\nand the river.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Sir Colin himself led the advance, the Fifty-Third and\nFourth Punjab Infantry in skirmishing order, with the Ninety-Third in\nline, the cavalry on our left, and Peel's guns and the horse-artillery\nat intervals, with the Forty-Second in the second line for our support.Directly we emerged from the shelter of the buildings which had masked\nour formation, the piquets fell back, the skirmishers advanced at the\ndouble, and the enemy opened a tremendous cannonade on us with\nround-shot, shell, and grape.But, nothing daunted, our skirmishers soon\nlined the canal, and our line advanced, with the pipers playing and the\ncolours in front of the centre company, without the least\nwavering,--except now and then opening out to let through the round-shot\nwhich were falling in front, and rebounding along the hard\nground-determined to show the Gwalior Contingent that they had different\nmen to meet from those whom they had encountered under Wyndham a week\nbefore.By the time we reached the canal, Peel's Blue-jackets were\ncalling out--\"Damn these cow horses,\" meaning the gun-bullocks, \"they're\ntoo slow!Come, you Ninety-Third, give us a hand with the drag-ropes as\nyou did at Lucknow!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.We were then well under the range of the enemy's\nguns, and the excitement was at its height.A company of the\nNinety-Third slung their rifles, and dashed to the assistance of the\nBlue-jackets.The bullocks were cast adrift, and the native drivers were\nnot slow in going to the rear.The drag-ropes were manned, and the\n24-pounders wheeled abreast of the first line of skirmishers just as if\nthey had been light field-pieces.When we reached the bank the infantry paused for a moment to see if the\ncanal could be forded or if we should have to cross by the bridge over\nwhich the light field-battery were passing at the gallop, and\nunlimbering and opening fire, as soon as they cleared the head of the\nbridge, to protect our advance.At this juncture the enemy opened on us\nwith grape and canister shot, but they fired high and did us but little\ndamage.As the peculiar _whish_ (a sound when once heard never to be\nforgotten) of the grape was going over our heads, the Blue-jackets gave\na ringing cheer for the \"Red, white, and blue!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.While the Ninety-Third,\nled off by Sergeant Daniel White, struck up _The Battle of the Alma_, a\nsong composed in the Crimea by Corporal John Brown of the Grenadier\nGuards, and often sung round the camp-fires in front of Sebastopol.I\nhere give the words, not for their literary merit, but to show the\nspirit of the men who could thus sing going into action in the teeth of\nthe fire of thirty well-served, although not very correctly-aimed guns,\nto encounter a force of more than ten to one.Just as the Blue-jackets\ngave their hurrah for the \"Red, white, and blue,\" Dan White struck up\nthe song, and the whole line, including the skirmishers of the\nFifty-Third and the sailors, joined in the stirring patriotic tune,\nwhich is a first-rate quick march:\n\n    Come, all you gallant British hearts\n      Who love the Red and Blue,[30]\n    Come, drink a health to those brave lads\n      Who made the Russians rue.Fill up your glass and let it pass,\n      Three cheers, and one cheer more,\n    For the fourteenth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We sailed from Kalimita Bay,\n      And soon we made the coast,\n    Determined we would do our best\n      In spite of brag and boast.We sprang to land upon the strand,\n      And slept on Russian shore,\n    On the fourteenth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We marched along until we came\n      Upon the Alma's banks,\n    We halted just beneath their guns\n      To breathe and close our ranks.we heard, and at the word\n      Right through the brook we bore,\n    On the twentieth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We scrambled through the clustering vines,\n      Then came the battle's brunt;\n    Our officers, they cheered us on,\n      Our colours waved in front;\n    And fighting well full many fell,\n      Alas!to rise no more,\n    On the twentieth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.The French were on the right that day,\n      And flanked the Russian line,\n    While full upon their left they saw\n      The British bayonets shine.With hearty cheers we stunned their ears,\n      Amidst the cannon's roar,\n    On the twentieth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.A picnic party Menschikoff\n      Had asked to see the fun;\n    The ladies came at twelve o'clock\n      To see the battle won.They found the day too hot to stay,\n      The Prince felt rather sore,\n    On the twentieth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.For when he called his carriage up,\n      The French came up likewise;\n    And so he took French leave at once\n      And left to them the prize.The Chasseurs took his pocket-book,\n      They even sacked his store,\n    On the twentieth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.A letter to Old Nick they found,\n      And this was what it said:\n    \"To meet their bravest men, my liege,\n      Your soldiers do not dread;\n    But devils they, not mortal men,\"\n      The Russian General swore,\n    \"That drove us off the Alma's heights\n      In September, fifty-four.\"Long life to Royal Cambridge,\n      To Peel and Camperdown,\n    And all the gallant British Tars\n      Who shared the great renown,\n    Who stunned Russian ears with British cheers,\n      Amidst the cannon's roar,\n    On the twentieth of September,\n      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.Here's a health to noble Raglan,\n      To Campbell and to Brown,\n    And all the gallant Frenchmen\n      Who shared that day's renown.Whilst we displayed the black cockade,\n      They the tricolour bore;\n    The Russian crew wore gray and blue\n      In September, fifty-four.Come, let us drink a toast to-night,\n      Our glasses take in hand,\n    And all around this festive board\n      In solemn silence stand.Before we part let each true heart\n      Drink once to those no more,\n    Who fought their last fight on Alma's height\n      In September, fifty-four!Around our bivouac fires that night as _The Battle of the Alma_ was sung\nagain, Daniel White told us that when the Blue-jackets commenced\ncheering under the hail of grape-shot, he remembered that the Scots\nGreys and Ninety-Second Highlanders had charged at Waterloo singing\n_Bruce's Address at Bannockburn_, \"Scots wha hae,\" and trying to think\nof something equally appropriate in which Peel's Brigade might join, he\ncould not at the moment recall anything better than the old Crimean song\naforesaid.After clearing the canal and re-forming our ranks, we came under shelter\nof a range of brick kilns behind which stood the camp of the enemy, and\nbehind the camp their infantry were drawn up in columns, not deployed in\nline.The rum against which Sir Colin had warned us was in front of the\ncamp, casks standing on end with the heads knocked out for convenience;\nand there is no doubt but the enemy expected the Europeans would break\ntheir ranks when they saw the rum, and had formed up their columns to\nfall on us in the event of such a contingency.But the Ninety-Third\nmarched right on past the rum barrels, and the supernumerary rank soon\nupset the casks, leaving the contents to soak into the dry ground.As soon as we cleared the camp, our line of infantry was halted.Up to\nthat time, except the skirmishers, we had not fired a shot, and we could\nnot understand the reason of the halt till we saw the Ninth Lancers and\nthe detachment of Hodson's Horse galloping round some fields of tall\nsugar-cane on the left, masking the light field-battery.When the enemy\nsaw the tips of the lances (they evidently did not see the guns) they\nquickly formed squares of brigades.They were armed with the old musket,\n\"Brown Bess,\" and did not open fire till the cavalry were within about\nthree hundred yards.Just as they commenced to fire, we could hear Sir\nHope Grant, in a voice as loud as a trumpet, give the command to the\ncavalry, \"Squadrons, outwards!\"while Bourchier gave the order to his\ngunners, \"Action, front!\"The cavalry wheeled as if they had been at a\nreview on the Calcutta parade-ground; the guns, having previously been\ncharged with grape, were swung round, unlimbered as quick as lightning\nwithin about two hundred and fifty yards of the squares, and round after\nround of grape was poured into the enemy with murderous effect, every\ncharge going right through, leaving a lane of dead from four to five\nyards wide.By this time our line was advanced close up behind the\nbattery, and we could see the mounted officers of the enemy, as soon as\nthey caught sight of the guns, dash out of the squares and fly like\nlightning across the plain.Directly the squares were broken, our\ncavalry charged, while the infantry advanced at the double with the\nbayonet.The battle was won, and the famous Gwalior Contingent was a\nflying rabble, although the struggle was protracted in a series of\nhand-to-hand fights all over the plain, no quarter being given.Peel's\nguns were wheeled up, as already mentioned, as if they had been\n6-pounders, and the left wing of the enemy taken in rear and their\nretreat on the Calpee road cut off.What escaped of their right wing\nfled along this road.The cavalry and horse-artillery led by Sir Colin\nCampbell in person, the whole of the Fifty-Third, the Fourth Punjab\nInfantry, and two companies of the Ninety-Third, pursued the flying mass\nfor fourteen miles.The rebels, being cut down by hundreds wherever they\nattempted to rally for a stand, at length threw away their arms and\naccoutrements to expedite their flight, for none were spared,--\"neither\nthe sick man in his weakness, nor the strong man in his strength,\" to\nquote the words of Colonel Alison.The evening closed with the total\nrout of the enemy, and the capture of his camp, the whole of his\nordnance-park, containing a large quantity of ammunition and thirty-two\nguns of sizes, siege-train, and field-artillery, with a loss of only\nninety-nine killed and wounded on our side.As night fell, large bodies of the left wing of the enemy were seen\nretreating from the city between our piquets and the Ganges, but we were\ntoo weary and too few in number to intercept them, and they retired\nalong the Bithoor road.About midnight the force which had followed the\nenemy along the Calpee road returned, bringing in a large number of\nammunition-waggons and baggage-carts, the bullocks driven by our men,\nand those not engaged in driving sitting on the waggons or carts, too\ntired and footsore to walk.We rested hungry and exhausted, but a man of\nmy company, named Bill Summers, captured a little pack-bullock loaded\nwith two bales of stuff which turned out to be fine soft woollen socks\nof Loodiana manufacture, sufficient to give every man in the company\nthree pairs,--a real godsend for us, since at that moment there was\nnothing we stood more in need of than socks; and as no commissariat had\ncome up from the rear, we slaughtered the bullock and cut it into\nsteaks, which we broiled on the tips of our ramrods around the bivouac\nfires.Thus we passed the night of the 6th of December, 1857.Early on the morning of the 7th a force was sent into the city of\nCawnpore, and patrolled it from end to end, east, west, north, and\nsouth.Not only did we meet no enemy, but many of the townspeople\nbrought out food and water to our men, appearing very glad to see us.During the afternoon our tents came up from the rear, and were pitched\nby the side of the Grand Trunk road, and the Forty-Second being put on\nduty that night, we of the Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third were allowed to\ntake our accoutrements off for the first night's sleep without them\nsince the 10th of November--seven and twenty days!Our spare kits\nhaving all vanished with the enemy, as told in the last chapter, our\nquarter-master collected from the captured baggage all the underclothing\nand socks he could lay hands on.Thanks to Bill Summers and the little\npack-bullock, my company got a change of socks; but there was more work\nbefore us before we got a bath or a change of shirts.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.About noon on the 8th the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by Sir Hope\nGrant and Brigadier Adrian Hope, had our brigade turned out, and as soon\nas Sir Colin rode in among us we knew there was work to be done.He\ncalled the officers to the front, and addressing them in the hearing of\nthe men, told them that the Nana Sahib had passed through Bithoor with a\nlarge number of men and seventeen guns, and that we must all prepare for\nanother forced march to overtake him and capture these guns before he\ncould either reach Futtehghur or cross into Oude with them.After\nstating that the camp would be struck as soon as we had got our dinners,\nthe Commander-in-Chief and Sir Hope Grant held a short but animated\nconversation, which I have always thought was a prearranged matter\nbetween them for our encouragement.In the full hearing of the men, Sir\nHope Grant turned to the Commander-in-Chief, and said, in rather a loud\ntone: \"I'm afraid, your Excellency, this march will prove a wild-goose\nchase, because the infantry, in their present tired state, will never be\nable to keep up with the cavalry.\"On this, Sir Colin turned round in\nhis saddle, and looking straight at us, replied in a tone equally loud,\nso as to be heard by all the men: \"I tell you, General Grant, you are\nwrong.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.You don't know these men; these Highlanders will march your\ncavalry blind.\"And turning to the men, as if expecting to be\ncorroborated by them, he was answered by over a dozen voices, \"Ay, ay,\nSir Colin, we'll show them what we can do!\"As soon as dinner was over we struck tents, loaded them on the\nelephants, and by two o'clock P.M.were on the march along the Grand\nTrunk road.By sunset we had covered fifteen miles from Cawnpore.Here\nwe halted, lit fires, cooked tea, served out grog, and after a rest of\nthree hours", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "on the 9th of December we had\nreached the thirtieth mile from the place where we started, and the\nscouts brought word to the general that we were ahead of the flying\nenemy.We then turned off the road to our right in the direction of the\nGanges, and by eight o'clock came in sight of the enemy at Serai _ghat_,\na ferry twenty-five miles above Cawnpore, preparing to embark the guns\nof which we were in pursuit.Our cavalry and horse-artillery at once galloped to the front through\nploughed fields, and opened fire on the boats.The enemy returned the\nfire, and some Mahratta cavalry made a dash at the guns, but their\ncharge was met by the Ninth Lancers and the detachment of Hodson's\nHorse, and a number of them cut down.Seeing the infantry advancing in\nline, the enemy broke and fled for the boats, leaving all their fifteen\nguns, a large number of ordnance waggons loaded with ammunition, and a\nhundred carts filled with their baggage and the plunder of Cawnpore.Our\nhorse-artillery and infantry advanced right up to the banks of the river\nand kept up a hot fire on the retreating boats, swamping a great number\nof them.The Nana Sahib was among this lot; but the spies reported that\nhis boat was the first to put off, and he gained the Oude side in\nsafety, though some thousands of his Mahratta rebels must have been\ndrowned or killed.This was some return we felt for his treachery at\nSuttee Chowrah _ghat_ six months before.It was now our turn to be\npeppering the flying boats!There were a number of women and children\nleft by the routed rebels among their baggage-carts; they evidently\nexpected to be killed, but were escorted to a village in our rear, and\nleft there.We showed them that we had come to war with men--not to\nbutcher women!By the afternoon we had dragged the whole of the captured\nguns back from the river, and our tents coming up under the rear-guard,\nwe encamped for the night, glad enough to get a rest.On the morning of the 10th our quarter-master divided among us a lot of\nshirts and underclothing, mostly what the enemy had captured at\nCawnpore, a great part of which we had now recovered; and we were\nallowed to go by wings to undress and have a bath in the sacred Ganges,\nand to change our underclothing, which we very much needed to do.The\ncondition of our flannel shirts is best left undescribed, while our\nbodies round our waists, where held tight by our belts, were eaten to\nraw flesh.We sent our shirts afloat on the sacred waters of Mother\nGunga, glad to be rid of them, and that night we slept in comfort.Even\nnow, thirty-five years after, the recollection of the state of my own\nflannel when I took it off makes me shiver.This is not a pleasant\nsubject, but I am writing these reminiscences for the information of our\nsoldiers of to-day, and merely stating facts, to let them understand\nsomething of what the soldiers of the Mutiny had to go through.Up to this time, the columns of the British had been mostly acting, as\nit were, on the defensive; but from the date of the defeat of the\nGwalior Contingent, our star was in the ascendant, and the attitude of\nthe country people showed that they understood which was the winning\nside.Provisions, such as butter, milk, eggs, and fruit, were brought\ninto our camp by the villagers for sale the next morning, sparingly at\nfirst, but as soon as the people found that they were well received and\nhonestly paid for their supplies, they came in by scores, and from that\ntime there was no scarcity of provisions in our bazaars.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.We halted at Serai _ghat_ for the 11th and 12th December, and on the\n13th marched back in triumph to Bithoor with our captured guns.The\nreason of our return to Bithoor was because spies had reported that the\nNana Sahib had concealed a large amount of treasure in a well there near\nthe palace of the ex-Peishwa of Poona.Rupees to the amount of thirty\n_lakhs_[31] were recovered, which had been packed in ammunition-boxes\nand sunk in a well; also a very large amount of gold and silver plate\nand other valuables, among other articles a silver howdah which had been\nthe state howdah of the ex-Peishwa.Besides the rupees, the plate and\nother valuables recovered were said to be worth more than a million\nsterling, and it was circulated in the force that each private soldier\nwould receive over a thousand rupees in prize-money.But we never got a\n_pie_![32] All we did get was hard work.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Four strong\nframes were erected on the top of it by the sappers, and large leathern\nbuckets with strong iron frames, with ropes attached, were brought from\nCawnpore; then a squad of twenty-five men was put on to each rope, and\nrelieved every three hours, two buckets keeping the water down and two\ndrawing up treasure.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Thus we worked day and night from the 15th to the\n26th of December, the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, and Ninety-Third\nsupplying the working-parties for pulling, and the Bengal Sappers\nfurnishing the men to work in the well; these last, having to stand in\nthe water all the time, were relieved every hour.It was no light work\nto keep the water down, so as to allow the sappers to sling the boxes\ncontaining the rupees, and to lift three million rupees, or thirty\n_lakhs_, out from a deep well required considerable labour.But the\nmen, believing that the whole would be divided as prize-money, worked\nwith a will.A paternal Government, however, ignored our general's\nassurance on this head, on the plea that we had merely recovered the\ntreasure carried off by the Nana from Cawnpore.The plate and jewellery\nbelonging to the ex-Peishwa were also claimed by the Government as State\nproperty, and the troops got--nothing!We had even to pay from our own\npockets for the replacement of our kits which were taken by the Gwalior\nContingent when they captured Wyndham's camp.About this time _The Illustrated London News_ reached India with a\npicture purporting to be that of the Nana Sahib.I forget the date of\nthe number which contained this picture; but I first saw it in Bithoor\nsome time between the 15th and 25th December 1857.I will now give the\nhistory of that picture, and show how Ajoodia Pershad, commonly known as\nJotee Pershad, the commissariat contractor, came to figure as the Nana\nSahib in the pages of _The Illustrated London News_.It is a well-known\nfact that there is no authentic portrait of the Nana in existence; it is\neven asserted that he was never painted by any artist, and photography\nhad not extended to Upper India before 1857.I believe this is the first\ntime that the history of the picture published as that of the Nana Sahib\nby _The Illustrated London News_ has been given.I learnt the facts\nwhich I am about to relate some years after the Mutiny, under a promise\nof secrecy so long as my informant, the late John Lang,\nbarrister-at-law and editor and proprietor of _The Mofussilite_, should\nbe alive.As both he and Ajoodia Pershad have been many years dead, I\ncommit no breach of confidence in now telling the story.The picture\npurporting to be that of the Nana having been published in 1857, it\nrightly forms a reminiscence of the Mutiny, although much of the\nfollowing tale occurred several years earlier; but to make the history\nof the picture complete, the facts which led to it must be noticed.There are but few Europeans now in India who remember the scandal\nconnected with the trial of Ajoodia Pershad, the commissariat\ncontractor, for payment for the supplies and carriage of the army\nthroughout the second Sikh war.When it came to a final settlement of\nhis accounts with the Commissariat Department, Ajoodia Pershad claimed\nthree and a half _crores_ of rupees (equal to three and a half millions\nsterling), in excess of what the auditor would pass as justly due to\nhim; and the Commissariat Department, backed by the Government of India,\nnot only repudiated the claim, but put Ajoodia Pershad on his trial for\nfalsification of accounts and attempting to defraud the Government.There being no high courts in those days, nor trial by jury, corrupt or\notherwise, for natives in the Upper Provinces, an order of the\nGovernor-General in Council was passed for the trial of Ajoodia Pershad\nby special commission, with the judge-advocate-general as prosecutor.The trial was ordered to be held at Meerut, and the commission\nassembled there, commencing its sittings in the Artillery mess-house\nduring the cold weather of 1851-52.There were no barristers or pleaders\nin India in those days--at least in the Mofussil, and but few in the\npresidency towns; but Ajoodia Pershad, being a very wealthy man, sent an\nagent to England, and engaged the services of Mr.John Lang,\nbarrister-at-law, to come out and defend him.John Lang left England in\nMay, 1851, and came out round the Cape in one of Green's celebrated\nliners, the _Nile_, and he reached Meerut about December, when the trial\ncommenced.Everything went swimmingly with the prosecution till Mr.Lang began his\ncross-examination of the witnesses, he having reserved his privilege\ntill he heard the whole case for the prosecution.Directly the\ncross-examination commenced, the weakness of the Government case became\napparent.I need not now recall how the commissary-general, the deputy\ncommissary-general, and their assistants were made to contradict each\nother, and to contradict themselves out of their own mouths.Lang,\nwho appeared in court every day in his wig and gown, soon became a noted\ncharacter in Meerut, and the night before he was to sum up the case for\nthe defence, some officers in the Artillery mess asked him his opinion\nof the members of the commission.Not being a teetotaller, Mr.Lang may\nhave been at the time somewhat under the influence of \"John Exshaw,\" who\nwas the ruling spirit in those days, and he replied that the whole\nbatch, president and members, including the judge-advocate-general, were\na parcel of \"d--d _soors_.\"[33] Immediately several officers present\noffered to lay a bet of a thousand rupees with Mr.Lang that he was not\ngame to tell them so to their faces in open court the following day.Lang accepted the bet, the stakes were deposited, and an umpire\nappointed to decide who should pocket the money.When the court\nre-assembled next morning, the excitement was intense.Lang opened\nhis address by pulling the evidence for the prosecution to shreds, and\nwarming to his work, he went at it somewhat as follows--I can only give\nthe purport:--\"Gentlemen of the commission forming this court, I now\nplace the dead carcass of this shameful case before you in all its naked\ndeformity, and the more we stir it up the more it stinks!The only stink\nin my long experience that I can compare it to is the experience gained\nin the saloon of the _Nile_ on my passage out to India the day after a\npig was slaughtered.We had a pig's cheek at the head of the table\n[indicating the president of the commission]; we had a roast leg of pork\non the right [pointing to another member]; we had a boiled leg, also\npork, on the left [indicating a third member]\"; and so on he went till\nhe had apportioned out the whole carcass of the supposed pig amongst the\nmembers of the commission.Then, turning to the judge-advocate-general,\nwho was a little man dressed in an elaborately frilled shirt, and his\nassistant, who was tall and thin, pointing to each in turn, Mr.Lang\nproceeded,--\"And for side-dishes we had chitterlings on one side, and\nsausages on the other.In brief, the whole saloon smelt of nothing but\npork: and so it is, gentlemen, with this case.It is the Government of\nIndia who has ordered this trial.It is for the interest of that\nGovernment that my client should be convicted; therefore every member on\nthis commission is a servant of Government.The officers representing\nthe prosecution are servants of Government, and every witness for the\nprosecution is also a servant of Government.In brief, the whole case\nagainst my client is nothing but pork, and a disgrace to the Government\nof India, and to the Honourable East India Company, who have sanctioned\nthis trial, and who put every obstacle in my way to prevent my coming\nout to defend my client.I repeat my assertion that the case is a\ndisgrace to the Honourable Company and the Government of India, and to\nevery servant of that Government who has had any finger in the\nmanufacture of this pork-pie.\"Lang continued, showing how\nAjoodia Pershad had come forward to the assistance of the State in its\nhour of need, by supplying carriage for the materials of the army and\nrations for the troops, and so forth, till the judge-advocate-general\ndeclared that he felt ashamed to be connected with the case.The result\nwas that Ajoodia Pershad was acquitted on all counts, and decreed to be\nentitled to his claims in full, and the umpire decided that Mr.Lang had\nwon the bet of a thousand rupees.But my readers may ask--What has all this to do with the portrait of the\nNana Sahib?After his honourable acquittal,\nAjoodia Pershad was so grateful to Mr.Lang that he presented him with\nan honorarium of three _lakhs_ of rupees, equal in those days to over\nL30,000, in addition to the fees on his brief; and Mr.Lang happening to\nsay that he would very much like to have a portrait of his generous\nclient, Ajoodia Pershad presented him with one painted by a famous\nnative artist of those days, and the portrait was enshrined in a\njewelled frame worth another twenty-five thousand rupees.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.Lang used to carry this portrait with him wherever he\nwent.When the Mutiny broke out he was in London, and the artists of\n_The Illustrated London News_ were calling on every old Indian of\nposition known to be in England, to try and get a portrait of the Nana.Lang possessed a picture of an Indian\nprince--then, as now, all Indians were princes to the British\npublic--which might be that of the arch-assassin of Cawnpore.The artist\nlost no time in calling on Mr.Lang to see the picture, and when he saw\nit he declared it was just the thing he wanted.Lang protested,\npointing out that the picture no more resembled the Nana of Bithoor than\nit did her Gracious Majesty the Queen of England; that neither the dress\nnor the position of the person represented in the picture could pass in\nIndia for a Mahratta chief.The artist declared he did not care for\npeople in India: he required the picture for the people of England.So\nhe carried it off to the engraver, and in the next issue of _The\nIllustrated London News_ the picture of Ajoodia Pershad, the\ncommissariat contractor, appeared as that of the Nana Sahib.When those\nin India who had known the Nana saw it, they declared it had no\nresemblance to him whatever, and those who had seen Ajoodia Pershad\ndeclared that the Nana was very like Ajoodia Pershad.But no one could\nunderstand how the Nana could ever have allowed himself to be painted in\nthe dress of a Marwaree banker.To the day of his death John Lang was in\nmortal fear lest Ajoodia Pershad should ever come to hear how his\npicture had been allowed to figure as that of the arch-assassin of the\nIndian Mutiny.By Christmas Day, 1857, we had recovered\nall the gold and silver plate of the ex-Peishwa and the thirty _lakhs_\nof treasure from the well in Bithoor, and on the morning of the 27th we\nmarched for the recapture of Futtehghur, which was held by a strong\nforce under the Nawab of Furruckabad.But I must leave the re-occupation\nof Futtehghur for another chapter.NOTE\n\n      Jotee Pershad was the native banker who, during the height\n      of the Mutiny, victualled the Fort of Agra and saved the\n      credit, if not the lives, of the members of the Government\n      of the North-West Provinces.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[29] Now Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Gough, V.C., K.C.B.[30] \"Red and Blue \"--the Army and Navy.The tune is _The

HORSE--ACTION AT THE KALEE NUDDEE--FUTTEHGHUR\n\n\nAs a further proof that the British star was now in the ascendant,\nbefore we had been many days in Bithoor each company had got its full\ncomplement of native establishment, such as cooks, water-carriers,\nwasher-men, etc.We left Bithoor on the 27th of December _en route_ for\nFuttehghur, and on the 28th we made a forced march of twenty-five miles,\njoining the Commander-in-Chief on the 29th.Early on the 30th we reached\na place named Meerun-ke-serai, and our tents had barely been pitched\nwhen word went through the camp like wildfire that Hodson, of Hodson's\nHorse, and another officer[34] had arrived in camp with despatches from\nBrigadier Seaton to the Commander-in-Chief, having ridden from\nMynpooree, about seventy miles from where we were.We of the Ninety-Third were eager to see Hodson, having heard so much\nabout him from the men of the Ninth Lancers.There was nothing, however\ndaring or difficult, that Hodson was not believed capable of doing, and\na ride of seventy miles more or less through a country swarming with\nenemies, where every European who ventured beyond the range of British\nguns literally carried his life in his hand, was not considered anything\nextraordinary for him.Personally, I was most anxious to see this famous\nfellow, but as yet there was no chance; Hodson was in the tent of the\nCommander-in-Chief, and no one knew when he might come out.However, the\nhours passed, and during the afternoon a man of my company rushed into\nthe tent, calling, \"Come, boys, and see Hodson!He and Sir Colin are in\nfront of the camp; Sir Colin is showing him round, and the smile on the\nold Chief's face shows how he appreciates his companion.\"I hastened to\nthe front of the camp, and was rewarded by having a good look at Hodson;\nand, as the man who had called us had said, I could see that he had made\na favourable impression on Sir Colin.Little did I then think that in\nless than three short months I should see Hodson receive his\ndeath-wound, and that thirty-five years after I should be one of the few\nspared to give evidence to save his fair fame from undeserved slander.My memory always turns back to that afternoon at Meerunke-serai when I\nread any attack on the good name of Hodson of Hodson's Horse.And\nwhatever prejudiced writers of the present day may say, the name of\nHodson will be a name to conjure with among the Sikhs of the Punjab for\ngenerations yet unborn.On the 1st of January, 1858, our force reached the Kalee Nuddee\nsuspension bridge near Khoodagunj, about fifteen miles from Futtehghur,\njust in time to prevent the total destruction of the bridge by the\nenemy, who had removed a good part of the planking from the roadway, and\nhad commenced to cut the iron-work when we arrived.We halted on the\nCawnpore side of the Kalee Nuddee on New Year's Day, while the\nengineers, under cover of strong piquets, were busy replacing the\nplanking of the roadway on the suspension bridge.Early on the morning\nof the 2nd of January the enemy from Futtehghur, under cover of a thick\nfog along the valley of the Kalee Nuddee, came down in great force to\ndispute the passage of the river.The first intimation of their approach\nwas a shell fired on our advance piquet; but our camp was close to the\nbridge, and the whole force was under arms in an instant.As soon as the\nfog lifted the enemy were seen to have occupied the village of\nKhoodagunj in great force, and to have advanced one gun, a 24-pounder,\nplanting it in the toll-house which commanded the passage of the bridge,\nso as to fire it out of the front window just as if from the porthole of\na ship.As soon as the position of the enemy was seen, the cavalry brigade of\nour force was detached to the left, under cover of the dense jungle\nalong the river, to cross by a ford which was discovered about five\nmiles up stream to our left, the intention of the movement being to get\nin behind the enemy and cut off his retreat to Futtehghur.The Fifty-Third were pushed across the bridge to reinforce the piquets,\nwith orders not to advance, but to act on the defensive, so as to allow\ntime for the cavalry to get behind the enemy.The right wing of the\nNinety-Third was also detached with some horse-artillery guns to the\nright, to cross by another ford about three miles below the bridge, to\nattack the enemy on his left flank.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.The left wing was held in reserve\nwith the remainder of the force behind the bridge, to be in readiness to\nreinforce the Fifty-Third in case of need.By the time these dispositions were made, the enemy's gun from the\ntoll-house had begun to do considerable damage.Peel's heavy guns were\naccordingly brought to bear on it, and, after a round or two to feel\ntheir distance, they were able to pitch an 8-inch shell right through\nthe window, which burst under the gun, upsetting it, and killing or\ndisabling most of the enemy in the house.Immediately after this the Fifty-Third, being well in advance, noticed\nthe enemy attempting to withdraw some of his heavy guns from the\nvillage, and disregarding the order of the Commander-in-Chief not to\nprecipitate the attack, they charged these guns and captured two or\nthree of them.This check caused the enemy's line to retire, and Sir\nColin himself rode up to the Fifty-Third to bring to book the officer\ncommanding them for prematurely commencing the action.This officer\nthrew the blame on the men, stating that they had made the charge\nagainst his orders, and that the officers had been unable to keep them\nback.Sir Colin then turned on the men, threatening to send them to the\nrear, and to make them do fatigue-duty and baggage-guard for the rest of\nthe campaign.On this an old Irishman from the ranks called out: \"Shure,\nSir Colin, you don't mean it!You'll never send us on fatigue-duty\nbecause we captured those guns that the Pandies were carrying off?\";\nHearing this, Sir Colin asked what guns he meant.\"Shure, them's the\nguns,\" was the answer, \"that Sergeant Dobbin [now Joe Lee of Cawnpore]\nand his section are dragging on to the road.\"Sir Colin seeing the guns,\nhis stern countenance relaxed and broke into a smile, and he made some\nremark to the officer commanding that he did not know about the guns\nhaving been withdrawn before the regiment had made the rush on the\nenemy.On this the Irish spokesman from the ranks called out: \"Three\ncheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys!I told you he did not mean us\nto let the Pandies carry off those guns.\"By this time our right wing and the horse-artillery had crossed the ford\non our right and were well advanced on the enemy's left flank.But we of\nthe main line, composed of the Eighth (the old \"King's\"--now called the\nLiverpool Regiment, I think), the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, and left\nwing of the Ninety-Third under Adrian Hope, were allowed to advance\nslowly, just keeping them in sight.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.The enemy retired in an orderly\nmanner for about three or four miles, when they formed up to make a\nstand, evidently thinking we were afraid to press them too closely.As\nsoon as they faced round again, our line was halted only about seven\nhundred yards from them, and just then we could see our cavalry\ndebouching on to the Grand Trunk road about a mile from where we were.My company was in the centre of the road, and I could see the tips of\nthe lances of the Ninth wheeling into line for a charge right in the\nenemy's rear.He was completely out-generalled, and his retreat cut off.The excitement was just then intense, as we dared not fire for fear of\nhitting our men in the rear.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.The Forty-First Native Infantry was the\nprincipal regiment of the enemy's line on the Grand Trunk road.Directly\nthey saw the Lancers in their rear they formed square while the enemy's\ncavalry charged our men, but were met in fine style by Hodson's Horse\nand sent flying across the fields in all directions.The Ninth came down\non the square of the Native Infantry, who stood their ground and opened\nfire.The Lancers charged well up to within about thirty yards, when the\nhorses turned off right and left from the solid square.We were just\npreparing to charge it with the bayonet, when at that moment the\nsquadrons were brought round again, just as a hawk takes a circle for a\nswoop on its prey, and we saw Sergeant-Major May, who was mounted on a\npowerful untrained horse, dash on the square and leap right into it,\nfollowed by the squadron on that side.The square being thus broken, the\nother troops of the Ninth rode into the flying mass, and in less than\nfive minutes the Forty-First regiment of Native Infantry was wiped out\nof the ranks of the mutineers.The enemy's line of retreat became a\ntotal rout, and the plain for miles was strewn with corpses speared down\nby the Lancers or hewn down by the keen-edged sabres of Hodson's Horse.Our infantry line now advanced, but there was nothing for us to do but\ncollect the ammunition-carts and baggage of the enemy.Just about sunset\nwe halted and saw the Lancers and Sikhs returning with the captured\nstandards and every gun which the enemy had brought into the field in\nthe morning.The infantry formed up along the side of the Grand Trunk\nroad to cheer the cavalry as they returned.It was a sight never to be\nforgotten,--the infantry and sailors cheering the Lancers and Sikhs, and\nthe latter returning our cheers and waving the captured standards and\ntheir lances and sabres over their heads!Sir Colin Campbell rode up,\nand lifting his hat, thanked the Ninth Lancers and Sikhs for their day's\nwork.It was reported in the camp that Sir Hope Grant had recommended\nSergeant-Major May for the Victoria Cross, but that May had modestly\nremonstrated against the honour, saying that every man in the Ninth was\nas much entitled to the Cross as he was, and that he was only able to\nbreak the square by the accident of being mounted on an untrained horse\nwhich charged into the square instead of turning off from it.This is of\ncourse hearsay, but I believe it is fact.I may here remark that this charge of the Lancers forcibly impressed me\nwith the absurdity of our cavalry-drill for the purpose of breaking an\ninfantry square.On field-days in time of peace our cavalry were made\nto charge squares of infantry, and directly the horses came within\nthirty or forty yards the squadrons opened out right and left, galloping\nclear of the square under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses\nwere thus drilled to turn off and gallop clear of the squares, instead\nof charging home right through the infantry.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.When it came to actual war\nthe horses, not being reasoning animals, naturally acted just as on a\nfield-day; instead of charging straight into the square, they galloped\nright past it, simply because they were drilled to do so.Of course, I\ndo not propose that several battalions of infantry should be slaughtered\nevery field-day for the purpose of training cavalry.But I would have\nthe formation altered, and instead of having the infantry in solid\nsquares, I would form them into quarter distance columns, with lanes\nbetween the companies wide enough for the cavalry to gallop through\nunder the blank fire of the infantry.The horses would thus be trained\nto gallop straight on, and no square of infantry would be able to resist\na charge of well-trained cavalry when it came to actual war.I am\nconvinced, in my own mind, that this was the reason that the untrained\nremount ridden by Sergeant-Major May charged into the square of the\nForty-First, and broke it, while the well-drilled horses galloped round\nthe flanks in spite of their riders.But the square once being broken,\nthe other horses followed as a matter of course.However, we are now in\nthe age of breech-loaders and magazine rifles, and I fear the days of\ncavalry charging squares of infantry are over.But we are still a long\nway from the millennium, and the experience of the past may yet be\nturned to account for the wars of the future.We reached Futtehghur on the morning of the 3rd of January to find it\ndeserted, the enemy having got such a \"drubbing\" that it had struck\nterror into their reserves, which had bolted across the Ganges, leaving\nlarge quantities of Government property behind them, consisting of tents\nand all the ordnance stores of the Gun-carriage Agency.The enemy had\nalso established a gun and shot and shell foundry here, and a\npowder-factory, all of which they had abandoned, leaving a number of\nbrass guns in the lathes, half turned, with many more just cast, and\nlarge quantities of metal and material for the manufacture of both\npowder and shot.During the afternoon of the day of our arrival the whole force was\nturned out, owing to a report that the Nawab of Furruckabad was still in\nthe town; and it was said that the civil officer with the force had sent\na proclamation through the city that it would be given over to plunder\nif the Nawab was not surrendered.Whether this was true or not, I cannot\nsay.The district was no longer under martial law, as from the date of\nthe defeat of the Gwalior Contingent the civil power had resumed\nauthority on the right bank of the Ganges.But so far as the country was\nconcerned, around Futtehghur at least, this merely meant that the\nhangmen's noose was to be substituted for rifle-bullet and bayonet.However, our force had scarcely been turned out to threaten the town of\nFurruckabad when the Nawab was brought out, bound hand and foot, and\ncarried by _coolies_ on a common country _charpoy_.[35] I don't know\nwhat process of trial he underwent; but I fear he had neither jury nor\ncounsel, and I know that he was first smeared over with pig's fat,\nflogged by sweepers, and then hanged.This was by the orders of the\ncivil commissioner.Both Sir Colin Campbell and Sir William Peel were\nsaid to have protested against the barbarity, but this I don't know for\ncertain.We halted in Futtehghur till the 6th, on which date a brigade, composed\nof the Forty-Second, Ninety-Third, a regiment of Punjab infantry, a\nbattery of artillery, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers, and Hodson's\nHorse, marched to Palamhow in the Shumshabad district.This town had\nbeen a hot-bed of rebellion under the leadership of a former native\ncollector of revenue, who had proclaimed himself Raja of the district,\nand all the bad characters in it had flocked to his standard.We encamped outside the town,\nand the civil police, along with the commissioner, arrested great\nnumbers, among them being the man who had proclaimed himself the Raja or\nNawab for the Emperor of Delhi.My company, with some of Hodson's Horse\nand two artillery guns, formed a guard for the civil commissioner in the\n_chowk_ or principal square of the town.The commissioner held his court\nin what had formerly been the _kotwaiee_ or police station.I cannot say\nwhat form of trial the prisoners underwent, or what evidence was\nrecorded against them.I merely know that they were marched up in\nbatches, and shortly after marched back again to a large tree of the\nbanian species, which stood in the centre of the square, and hanged\nthereon.This went on from about three o'clock in the afternoon till\ndaylight the following morning, when it was reported that there was no\nmore room on the tree, and by that time there were one hundred and\nthirty men hanging from its branches.Many charges of cruelty and want of pity have been made against the\ncharacter of Hodson.This makes me here mention", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "During the afternoon of the day of\nwhich I write, Hodson visited the squadron of his regiment forming the\ncavalry of the civil commissioner's guard.Just at the time of his visit\nthe commissioner wanted a hangman, and asked if any man of the\nNinety-Third would volunteer for the job, stating as an inducement that\nall valuables in the way of rings or money found on the persons of the\ncondemned would become the property of the executioner.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.No one\nvolunteering for the job, the commissioner asked Jack Brian, a big tall\nfellow who was the right-hand man of the company, if he would act as\nexecutioner.Jack Brian turned round with a look of disgust, saying:\n\"Wha do ye tak' us for?We of the Ninety-Third enlisted to fight men\nwith arms in their hands.I widna' become yer hangman for all the loot\nin India!\"Captain Hodson was standing close by, and hearing the answer,\nsaid, \"Well answered, my brave fellow.I wish to shake hands with you,\"\nwhich he did.Then turning to Captain Dawson, Hodson said: \"I'm sick of\nwork of this kind.I'm glad I'm not on duty;\" and he mounted his horse,\nand rode off.However, some _domes_[36] or sweeper-police were found to\nact as hangmen, and the trials and executions proceeded.We returned to Futtehghur on the 12th of January and remained in camp\nthere till the 26th, when another expedition was sent out in the same\ndirection.But this time only the right wing of the Ninety-Third and a\nwing of the Forty-Second formed the infantry, so my company remained in\ncamp.This second force met with more opposition than the first one.Lieutenant Macdowell, Hodson's second in command, and several troopers\nwere killed, and Hodson himself and some of his men were badly wounded,\nHodson having two severe cuts on his sword arm; while the infantry had\nseveral men killed who were blown up with gunpowder.This force returned\non the 28th of January, and either on the 2nd or 3rd of February we left\nFuttehghur _en route_ again for Lucknow _via_ Cawnpore.We reached Cawnpore by ordinary marches, crossed into Oude, and encamped\nat Oonao till the whole of the siege-train was passed on to Lucknow.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[34] Lieutenant Macdowell, second in command of Hodson's Horse.CHAPTER X\n\nTHE STRANGE STORY OF JAMIE GREEN\n\n\nWhen we returned to Cawnpore, although we had been barely two months\naway, we found it much altered.Many of the burnt-down bungalows were\nbeing rebuilt, and the fort at the end of the bridge of boats had become\nquite a strong place.The well where the murdered women and children\nwere buried was now completely filled up, and a wooden cross erected\nover it.I visited the slaughter-house again, and found the walls of the\nseveral rooms all scribbled over both in pencil and charcoal.This had\nbeen done since my first visit in October; I am positive on this point.The unfortunate women who were murdered in the house left no writing on\nthe walls whatever.There was writing on the walls of the barrack-rooms\nof Wheeler's entrenchment, mostly notes that had been made during the\nsiege, but none on the walls of the slaughter-house.As mentioned in my\nlast chapter, we only halted one day in Cawnpore before crossing into\nOude, and marching to Oonao about the 10th of February, we encamped\nthere as a guard for the siege-train and ordnance-park which was being\npushed on to Lucknow.While at Oonao a strange thing happened, which I shall here set down.Men live such busy lives in India that many who may have heard the story\nat the time have possibly forgotten all about it, while to most of my\nhome-staying readers it will be quite fresh.Towards the end of February, 1858, the army for the siege of Lucknow was\ngradually being massed in front of the doomed city, and lay, like a huge\nboa-constrictor coiled and ready for its spring, all along the road from\nCawnpore to the Alumbagh.A strong division, consisting of the\nForty-Second and Ninety-Third Highlanders, the Fifty-Third, the Ninth\nLancers, Peel's Naval Brigade, the siege-train, and several batteries of\nfield-artillery, with the Fourth Punjab Infantry and other Punjabee\ncorps, lay at Oonao under the command of General Sir Edward Lugard and\nBrigadier Adrian Hope.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by\nropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were\nthe words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass\nof gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,\n\"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating\ncoffin like that\"----\n\nKAPS.Are\nyou so clever that when you're half drunk----\n\nSIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's\nassistant, that when you say \"no,\" and the owner and the Insurance\nCompany say \"yes,\" my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that\nif Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if\nMees--there will be murder.[Goes back to his desk;

country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on\nSaturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other\nLions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the\nColonies.In fact what happened seems to\nconfirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY\nBUXTON, \"control\" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at\nForeign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of\ndistinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front\nOpposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;\npatriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which\nit is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political\ngame shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able\nyoung men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible\nperson, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations\nderogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British\nofficials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of\nHouse, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons\nnine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable\npractice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]\n\nThis is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much\nsimpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a\nput-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,\ndisclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his\nstep towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and\nknowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played\nBASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long\nspeech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was\narrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's\nart, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House\nof Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite\nhave sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is\ntaking the waters elsewhere.Sat up\nall last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen\nentrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six\nmillions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office\nVote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours\nto reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily\nexistence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;\nbut only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside\ntill the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of\nthe Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by\nthe all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by\nprotest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be\nhanded over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,\nand not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of\nabsentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So\nLords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted\nTenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK\nROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries\nof House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority\nof 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned\nholiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well\namid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of\nunexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will\nin its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The\nSQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House\nof Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a\nfailure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a\nsuccess, his be the praise.\"Well, good bye,\" said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as\nhe wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader.\"But you know it's not all\nover yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes\nup on Second Reading?\"\"Oh, dam WEIR,\" said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually\nequable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty\nmonths, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that\nthe SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a\nproceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which\nremark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;\nthe same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by\never-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal\nmade to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue\nunderstanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered\nthe English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton\nto Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken\nout into elegiac verse.\"NEWNES,\" he exclaims,\n\n  \"NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;\n  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line.\"That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to\nparallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented\nby a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where\n\n  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,\n  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym \"A Village\nPeasant,\" should look in at the House of Commons and continue his\nstudies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK\nsays the thing is easy enough.\"Toss 'em off in no time,\" says he.\"There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet\nparentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one\nmight have said:--\n\n  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;\n  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line.\"_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said \"Dam.\"_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill

and through the hall to a\nbrightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half\ndozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were\nunoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver\nsparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in\ngowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious\nwhen she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to\nthe one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had\nmet her at the boat.The silence and the steady\nscrutiny of the others began to embarrass her.\"Where--where is\nAuntie?\"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly\nin her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down\nin confusion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.asked one of the younger women of

table, while the women\nsat regarding the girl curiously.\"But,\" continued Carmen in a trembling voice, \"where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore\nsuch an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and

that she was going to blast?\"Look here,\" she cried sharply, \"tell me again all about yourself, and\nabout your friends and family down south, and what it was that the\nMadam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the\nstory.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and\nthen a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to\nstray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she\nherself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New\nEngland farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,\ntrudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired\nmother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over\nher little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as\nthe eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible\ndream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag\ndown to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might\nthereafter fall!\"And I have just had to know,\" Carmen concluded, \"every minute since I\nleft Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any\nharm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_\nopens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught.\"The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness\nupon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she\nknelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to\nbless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged\nto her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent\nthough she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her\nlips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening.She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to\nformulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,\nwhich she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress.\"Now,\" she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained\nvoice, \"you do just as I say.And for God's sake\ndon't speak!\"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and\nlocked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped\nsoftly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl\nhad first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of\nglasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near\nthem opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen\ninto a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to\nanother door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a\nwindow, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a\npadlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl\nprecede her cautiously.\"It's a fire-escape,\" she explained briefly.She reached through the\nwindow grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and\nquickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept\nswiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped\nto throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the\nbureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they\nemerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,\nand the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,\nfelt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street\nbrought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high\nboard fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister\nSuperior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they\nwere silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,\nsimilarly dressed, awaited them.\"Sister,\" said Jude excitedly, \"here's a little kid--you got to care\nfor her until she finds her friends!\"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman.\"Let\nthe child wait here a moment,\" she said, \"and you come with me and\ntell your story.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.It would be better that she should not hear.\"Carmen was drowsing in her\nchair.\"She's chock full of religion,\" the woman was saying.\"But you,\" the Sister replied, \"what will you do?\"Then you will stay here until--\"\n\n\"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I\ncouldn't stay here--with her,\" nodding toward the girl.\"But--you will\ntake care of her?\"\"Surely,\" returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night.\"Come,\" said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2\n\n\nCarmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its\nshrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes\nshe gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel\nthe tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the\ncall to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of\nHarris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of\nmemories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was\nalone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and\nfor a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and\ndrew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and\nplaced there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell\nopen to Isaiah, and she read aloud:\n\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine\n  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles.\"\"That means me,\" she said\nfirmly.\"Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I\nam to tell it to these people up here.God has called me in\nrighteousness.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little\nlad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the\nbed.\"I must think only God's thoughts,\"\nshe said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief.\"If it is\nright for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is\nnot right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I\nmust not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts.\"She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes.\"I simply\ncan not wear these things,\" she mourned, looking at them dubiously;\n\"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other\nwoman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And\nwhy was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter\nthere, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold.\"She shivered as\nshe buttoned her thin dress.\"But,\" she continued, \"I have got to go\nout now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find\nthem--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!\"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in\nthe bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's\nlittle locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in\nSimiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some\nmoments.\"I haven't any father or mother but God,\" she murmured.\"But\nHe is both father and mother to me now.\"With a little sigh she tied\nup the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much\ndespised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started\ndown the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped\nabruptly.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way\nthat they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not\nknown: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things\nstraight.'And Padre Jose said he would\nremember it, too.\"Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of\nthe priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,\nmurmuring at every step, \"God is everywhere--right here!\"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a\nnumber of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered\ncuriously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates\nwhen they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing\nuncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in\nthe other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for\nher in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her\ninto a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at\nbreakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated\nat the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive\nwonder.\"Well,\" began the Sister at length, \"eat your breakfast quickly.This\nis Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an\nhour.But you are with friends\nhere, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted\nflexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once\nupon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,\nthe subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded\nwith the cryptical remark: \"And, you know, Senora, it is all just as\nPadre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after\nall!\"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being\nwas this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts\non the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,\nthe Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--\"She's\nchock full of religion.\"But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering\nthe child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, \"The Virgin be\npraised!\"\"Oh,\" said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, \"you\npeople up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you\ndidn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many\nmore ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy\nwords in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the\nlast years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about\nGod in that language than in any other.\"And who is this\nJose that you talk so much about?\"\"He--taught me--in Simiti.\"Well,\" replied the Sister warmly, \"he seems to have taught you queer\nthings!\"returned Carmen quickly, \"he just taught me the truth.He\ndidn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they\nwere not real.\"Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's\nthought had strayed to other topics.she\nexclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her.\"I guess I'll\nhave to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.\"\"Certainly, child, put them on!\"\"Didn't you\nwear shoes in your country?\"\"No,\" replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; \"I didn't\nwear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,\nSenora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!\"She sighed, and her eyes\nfilled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at\nthe Sister.\"I've come here because it is right,\" she said with a firm\nnod of her head.\"Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you\ndidn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything\nelse!\"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she\nwent on briskly:\n\n\"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he\nhad to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,\nhe will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will\nhe?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't\nso, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora,\" she exclaimed,\nsuddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, \"is this a\nchurch?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while\nher manner became more severe; \"this is a home for old people, a\ncharitable institution.\"\"Oh,\" replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant.\"Well,\" her face alight and her eyes dancing, \"I don't belong here\nthen, do I?I am never going to be old,\" she meditated.The Bible says we\nare made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we\never grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane\nand saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong\nway of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be\nlike Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is\ntrue--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we\nhave all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there\nwill not be any places like this for old people--people who still\nbelieve that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on.\"Padre Jose\nsometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and\nhe always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was\nright, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus\ndid not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of\nthe bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,\nfirst said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,\nI've had thousands of proofs!\"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,\ncontinued:\n\n\"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is\nto tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the\nex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;\nand so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in\npower apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and\nthat is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and\nyou can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?\"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation.\"Oh, Senora,\" cried the enthusiastic girl, \"the things that Jesus\ntaught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in\nmathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be\ndemonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only\nin heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say\nso often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we\nwill be in heaven.But,\" she went on after catching\nher breath, \"we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be\nreal and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--\"\n\n\"I've heard that before,\" interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat\nfrom her surprise.\"But I think that before you get out of New York\nyou will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,\nand it is quite real, we find.\"\"If it is real, then God made it.It\nseems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in\nyour consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.\"\"Well,\" said the woman dryly, \"on that basis I think the same may be\nsaid of good, too.\"\"No,\" answered Carmen eagerly, \"good is--\"\n\n\"There,\" interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,\n\"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which\nthat fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and\none that she would not accept.\"Senora,\" she began again, after a brief interval, \"Padre Jose is a\ngood man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his\nproblem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other\npeople think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always\ntried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you\nare not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that,\" she\nsaid softly, \"is nothing.\"She was beginning to feel the spell of\nthose great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling\nexpression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from\nthose red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the\ngirl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign\nattire could not disguise.\"Senora,\" said Carmen suddenly, \"the people on the boat laughed at my\nclothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black\nbonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I\nwas brought here.\"It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman\ninstantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of\nsevere dignity.\"And\nremember after this that children's manners here are not those of your\ncountry.\"The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer\nroom, and presently a priest looked in.\"Good morning, Sister,\" he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the\ntwenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a\nround, shining face that radiated health and good nature.\"It is a little\nwaif,\" she said in answer to his query, \"who strayed in here last\nnight.\"\"Aha,\" said the priest, \"another derelict!And will you send her to\nthe orphanage?\"\"I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other\nchildren,\" replied the Sister.\"Father,\" she continued seriously, \"I\nwant you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should\nbe done with her.\"\"No,\" replied the Sister; \"but another priest has gone wrong, and\nthis,\" pointing to Carmen, \"is the result of his pernicious\nteachings.\"\"Very well, Sister,\" he said in a low voice.\"I will talk with her\nafter the service.\"He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,\nas he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to\nthe institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the\nchapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose\ncelebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such\nelaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the\nresponses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,\neven if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She\nthought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they\nhad all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and\nembarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people\nattracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And\nnever, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and\nhelplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there\nfor, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did\nthey believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine\ninto flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about\nthe people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,\nfrom her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,\nhad prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for\nthe old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest\ndescended from the pulpit and came to Carmen.\"Now, little girl,\" he\nsaid, seating himself beside her, \"tell me all about yourself, who you\nare, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into\nher narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the\npriest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation.\"But,\" she heard the priest say, \"you tell me that this\nFather Jose taught you these things?\"\"He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the\nworld,\" the girl replied.\"Yes, yes,\" the priest went on hurriedly; \"but these other things,\nthese religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?\"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, \"God.\"He reached out and laid a hand\non hers.\"I believe you,\" he said, in a voice scarcely audible.\"I\nbelieve you--for we do not teach such things.\"\"Then,\" she said quizzically,\n\"you are not really a priest.\"The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet\nchapel.\"The dinner-bell\nwill ring in a few minutes,\" continued the Sister, regarding the man\nseverely.\"Ah, true,\" he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock.\"The time\npassed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--\"\n\n\"Leave the girl to me,\" replied the Sister coldly.\"Unless,\" she\nadded, \"you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country\nsuddenly into this cold climate might--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" interrupted the priest hastily; \"she seems uncommonly strong\nmentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from\nours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her.\"He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her\nhead stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he\nturned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall\nand down a flight of steps to the kitchen below.\"Katherine,\" said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,\nwhite-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary\ndepartment, \"put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in\nyour room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out\nof her head.\"CHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir\nbairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air\nto yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister\nSuperior.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as\nthe soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.\"\"But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?\"There was a\nnote of appeal in the quavering voice.\"Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the\ntruth, God bless ye, honey!\"Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid\nye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air\na right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'\nkitchen.\"\"Sen--I mean, Sister--\"\n\n\"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.\"\"Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr.\"No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a\nbit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for\nth' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow.\"It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently\nfollowed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of\nstairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her\nthat her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental\naccumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the\nkitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,\nannunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which\nthe human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her\nfascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions\nshe dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not\nwholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose\nmountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her\nwith open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times\nduring the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her\nassumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon\nthe brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed\ncheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,\nthe woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in\na love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and\nsincere.\"Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds,\" said the\nwoman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out\nover the kindling lights of the city.\"Not much, I guess, honey,\" answered the woman frankly.\"Troth, an'\nI've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,\nan' she landed me in a convint!\"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--\"\n\n\"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle\non me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer\nth' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin\ntell, honey.An' so I ain't complainin'.\"\"But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!\"pleaded the girl, going to the\nwoman and twining her arms about her neck.\"Och, honey darlin'\"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and\nrolled down her wrinkled cheeks--\"honey darlin', call me Katie, just\nold Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a\nbeautiful daughter like you--!\"She clasped the girl in her great arms\nand held her tightly.\"Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given\nyou what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from\nseeing it.\"\"An' so, darlin', if I want\ndiamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?\"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft\ncheek against the leathery visage of the old woman.\"Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's\nnivir been said to old Katie!\"\"Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?\"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved\nme--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir\nland a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become\na bride o' th' Church.Why, your heart is as big--as big as\nthe whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that.\"Och, darlin',\" murmured the woman, \"sure th' Virgin be praised fer\nsendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!\"\"It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here,\" said the\ngirl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek.\"It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.\"\"Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,\nan' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be\ngood to His children.He is\ninfinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what\nawful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of\nthe great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there\nwouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole\nworld!Katie,\" after a little pause, \"I know.\"Air these more o' yer funny\nnotions, darlin'?\"\"I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie,\" answered the\ngirl.But then,\nth' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church\ndon't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm\nthinkin', does Father Waite.\"\"Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?\"\"He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught\nme what I know.\"Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny\nnotions?\"\"No, Katie, he said they were right.\"Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a\ngood man--troth, they make no better in this world!\"Carmen looked out wonderingly over\nthe city.She yearned to know what it held for her.\"Katie,\" she said at length, bending again over the woman, \"will you\nhelp me find Mr.\"Och, lassie--what's your name again?\"\"Carmen,\" replied the girl, \"Carmen Ariza.\"\"Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey;

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Through half-opened doors and windows it\nrolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains\nof brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it\nswirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the\nwindows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the\nchinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy\nrooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting\nexternal expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into\nthe chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,\nthin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets\nof his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,\nuntil it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like\nvisage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment\nof utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed\nit, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties\nof the Molino Company--the \"near-mines\" in the rocky canon of the\nfar-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian\nreview, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were\nadvertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,\ntrusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its\ninception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass\nKetchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and\nPhilip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those\nsturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly\nsevered the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the\nallurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable\nPacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove\nhim, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled\nfor many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless\nefforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less\nconstricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it\nseveral times.He aspired to the hand of a\nsister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the\nbest colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their\nhoneymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press\nnoticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from\nthe field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the\nKetchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,\nand then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the\nunrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman\nhurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only\nto find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and\nquestionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he\nimmediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of\nparasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has\nbattened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial\nenterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as\nis possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with\ndiligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly\ndifferent means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready\nwit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could\nthink of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a\nscoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed\nchampion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,\nmediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in\nthe minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his\ncups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was\npetulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive\nwisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,\nopenly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler\nways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore\nhis heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations\nwith him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his\ncharacter was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which\ncaused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap\nplaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James\nwholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though\nfar less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a\ntenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately\nto achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never\nadmitted defeat.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a\ndecided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular\ncourse he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary\nhabits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or\nliquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian\nchurch in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its\nSunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent\npiety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced\nhim a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it\nis true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,\nor any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love\nperformed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or\nmean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company\naffairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,\nrelations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of\nstrain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a\nhypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder\nPhilip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person\nof one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who\nthenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,\ngo-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and\nwhat-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that\ndropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in\nboth.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that\nmorning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to\ntake the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished\nfaces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and\nhammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets\nto a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed\nin the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,\nlaughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such\na queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,\nKetchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed\nand Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his\nlow forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly\ncontortions.\"Didn't they see that clause in their contract,\nproviding an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they\nmade a favorable report?\"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless\nentrance of the meek-souled Rawlins.\"A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and\naddresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive\nmatter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be\nfive dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less\nthan seven.I told him Molino stock would go\nup to par next month.\"How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?\"demanded Ketchim, without\nlooking up.\"Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at\npresent, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling\ndue--\"\n\n\"How soon?\"\"About a year, I think he said.\"\"Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that.And tell him to send his check at once\nfor the stock he has agreed to take.\"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused.\"Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the\ncheck in his pocket.\"Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage.\"You tell James,\" he cried,\npounding the desk with his fist, \"that as president and treasurer of\nthe Molino Company I demand that check!\"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank\nrefused to extend the time on your note.\"Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen.\"And here is the mail,\" pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a\nbundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort.\"Do\nyou know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?\"\"I--I believe he has, sir--a little.\"\"He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss\nLeveridge.\"\"Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold\ntheir farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the\npapers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he\nsent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight\ndollars a share, I believe.\"Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:\n\n\"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you\ninform me of the sale?\"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a\ncold eye.\"A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see\nthe notice until--\"\n\n\"As usual, James saw it first!\"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I\nsuppose?\"\"Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and\ntell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!\"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his\nglance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter\nand tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over\nthe paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he\ntook it up again and read aloud the closing words:\n\n  \"--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and\n  believing that your representations were made with intent to\n  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory\n  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise.\"Yours, etc.,\n                                                 \"J. WILTON AMES.\"Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer\nand consulted it.\"He put in ten thousand, cash,\" he murmured, closing\nthe book and replacing it.\"And I always wondered why, for he doesn't\ngo into things that he can't control.He\nshouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return\nthe money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his\nsleeve; and we've fallen for it!\"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did\nhe think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a\nyear or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he\nthinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with\nthe pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of\nthis I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!\"It was his stock\nresolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced\nthe arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing\nhis hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he\ncourteously greeted the callers.\"Well, fellows,\" he began, waving them to seats, \"it looks a\nlittle bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your\nreport--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday\nthat there was no hope.But,\" he continued gravely, and his face\ngrew serious, \"I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that\nthere are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.\"\"Why,\" continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, \"the little joker that\nJames inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in\nthe event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but\nhe said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how\nserious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once.\"We have\nbeen studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us,\" he suggested, \"a little of Molino's history.\"There isn't much to tell,\" replied Ketchim gloomily.\"The mines were\nlocated by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested\nBryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal\nagents.\"\"But you never had title to the property,\" said Reed.\"Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance\nof a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned\nthat we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties\nthat he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said\nthey lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title\nto the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or\nfour hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to\nwhich you never had even the shadow of a claim!\"\"But--\" murmured Ketchim weakly, \"we thought we had.We acted in good\nfaith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and\nsincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--\"\n\n\"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!\"\"I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather\nthan to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part\nof an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's\nwild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't\nsell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or\neight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!\"\"But Molino has no\nfunds--\"\n\n\"You are still selling stock, aren't you?\"\"We would not sell any more stock\nuntil we received your report--and not then, unless the report were\nfavorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon\nKetchim's sharp features.\"It is unfortunate, boys,\" the promoter continued dejectedly.\"But I\ncare nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am\nthinking about.I've prayed to be\nled to do right.\"I suggest,\" blurted out Harris, \"that, having already relieved them\nconsiderably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!\"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly\nsmile remained.\"I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help\nthese poor people,\" he mournfully replied.\"Well,\" pursued Harris, \"it'll help some when they learn that you're\nin one.\"\"Boys,\" said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,\n\"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and\nwe will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come\nover and see my little Sunday school.Fellows,\" he continued gravely,\n\"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your\nadverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust\nhim and wait.\"Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled\nexpressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:\n\n\"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must\nbe other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your\ntravels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for\nmines?\"\"Who'd furnish the wherewithal?\"\"Will your sheep stand for further shearing?\"\"Fellows,\" said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,\n\"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that\nwill save the Molino stockholders!\"\"I shall sacrifice myself,\" answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner\nhad now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other.\"I guess we\nmight as well,\" said Reed in a low voice.\"It is bound to come out,\nanyway.\"\"Sure,\" returned Harris; \"drive ahead.\"Ketchim,\" began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, \"when\nI came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my\nfriend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in\ntouch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,\nand, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in\nColombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your\nproperties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I\nsucceeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the\nproperties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months\nof parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own\nexpense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I\nwished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my\nown view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the\ncompany possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my\nassociate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on\nMolino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as\npart compensation.And now you have got to\nface a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of\ndollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I\nam convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of\nwidows and indigent clergymen.\"\"Which of my salesmen told you that?\"\"Let us waive that,\" replied Reed calmly.\"The fact is, you are in a\nhard way just at present, is it not so?\"\"Fellows,\" said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, \"the\nofficers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly\ndeceived and unfortunately--\"\n\n\"All right,\" interrupted Reed, \"we'll pass that.But Harris and I have\nplayed square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to\noffer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor\nstockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do\nknow of another property down there, but we haven't the title--\"\n\n\"That makes no difference!\"\"I mean, it can be\nacquired--\" striving to restrain his eagerness.\"The title is at present\nvested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This\ngirl came up to the States with us--\"\n\n\"Ha!\"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself.\"Then you\nbroke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might\nacquire there should belong to me!\"I believe,\" put in Harris dryly, \"we were employed by the Molino\ncompany.\"\"But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!\"queried Harris, with an insinuating\ngrin.\"I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course,\" said Ketchim,\nsubsiding.\"There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of\nagain,\" continued Reed.\"Nor is it likely that the title papers, which\nshe has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has\nfallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but\ntransferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a\nlarge interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate\nit.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and\nplace her in a school, at my own expense.\"He went on to relate the\nmanner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: \"Of course,\nthe title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's\nname, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now\nthat she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.\"\"No, that wouldn't be right to the old man,\" returned Reed.\"But, it\nmight be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old\nand penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare\nchance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a\ncompany to take over his mine, La Libertad.\"asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: \"Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living\nstrictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this\ninformation.It would require not less than one hundred thousand\ndollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,\nand erect a stamp-mill.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Harris and I are in no condition\nfinancially to advance or secure such an amount.\"\"It is barely possible,\" mused Harris, \"that my father and Uncle John\ncould do something.\"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under\ncontract with us--\"\n\n\"I have covered that point, Mr.\"But\nthe time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act\nfairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same\ntime make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon\nour business careers, and we have come to New York to establish\nourselves.We know where this mine\nis--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To\nforestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with\nhim at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the\ncompany, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally\nnegotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation\nfor our work.\"why didn't\nyou tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of\ntorment?Rawlins,\" he said, addressing\nthat individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, \"'phone\nCass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten\ndollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave\nyou a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!\"\"Has it to get,\" amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully.\"But\nnow while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,\nafter detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the\nproject which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been\ndescribing his experiences in the South.\"What we want is another organization, fellows,\" he said in\nconclusion, \"to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets\nwith stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the\nground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new\ncompany, eh?\"\"But one with a somewhat wider scope,\" suggested Cass, with an air of\nimportance.\"A sort of general development company, to secure La\nLibertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and\ndevelop the resources of the country.\"\"Just so,\" assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm.\"A company to\ngo in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,\nfellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get\nconcessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--\"\n\n\"Just rip things wide open, eh?\"\"Uncle Ted has influence at\nWashington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get\nanything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this\nis great!\"\"But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?\"\"Oh, I can sell the stock,\" replied Ketchim.\"Then, too, there's the\nMolino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be\nable to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,\nwhat'll we call it?\"I'd call it the Salvation Company,\" drawled Harris, \"as it is likely\nto delay your trip to Sing Sing.\"A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the\nremark.\"I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company,\" said Cass,\nafter a moment's dignified reflection.\"If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I\nthink I would capitalize for, say, about three millions.\"He went to\nthe desk and made some calculations.\"I assume,\" he continued somewhat\npompously after a few moments' figuring, \"that you wish to retain me,\nand that I am to take my compensation in stock?\"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded\nthat in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it\nwas only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate\nchance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare\ncommodity.\"Suppose, then,\" continued the sapient young lawyer, \"that we\ncapitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and\none thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for\ndevelopment purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one\nmillion, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new\ncompany; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for\npast and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;\ngive to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine\nthousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et\ncetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,\nforty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not\nto sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall\nbe placed upon a dividend-paying basis.If I had been Margaret Louise's own flesh and blood, she\nwould never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as\nif he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts\nfeel that way about me, I don't know.I don't even know if I feel that\nway about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and\nfeel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don't feel\nthat way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am\ncertain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there\nis only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be\nUncle Peter's one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of\npottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live\nin forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night.\"CHAPTER XVII\n\nA REAL KISS\n\n\nAt seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year\nof preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah's heart\nthat she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher\neducation should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was\nfinally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in\nall its bearings.\"If she doesn't decide in favor of college,\" David said, \"and she\nmakes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don't\nsee what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately\nnone of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet\neligible young men and that sort of thing.\"The two were having a cozy cup of tea at\nhis apartment.\"You're so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten\nme sometimes.\"\"You don't know where I will end, is that the idea?\"\"I don't know where Eleanor will end, if you're already thinking of\neligible young men for her.\"\"Those things have got to be thought of,\" David answered gravely.\"I don't want her to be\nmarried.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone\nfor a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her\nup quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away\nwith her.If we've all got to get together and connive at marrying her\noff there won't be any comfort in having her.\"\"I don't know,\" David said thoughtfully; \"I think that might be fun,\ntoo.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the\nmost interesting games in the world.\"\"That's not my idea of an interesting game,\" Margaret said.\"I like\nthings very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.\"\"I do know that,\" David said, \"but it sometimes occurs to me that\nexcept for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very\nlittle about you, Margaret.\"\"There isn't much to know--except that I'm a woman.\"\"That's a good deal,\" David answered slowly; \"to a mere man that seems\nto be considerable of an adventure.\"\"It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a\nfield of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,\nbut your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,\ndon't get any more, I've got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it's\nvery improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and\nyour ancient and honorable housekeeper.\"\"Don't go,\" David said; \"I apologize on my knees for the cream.I'll\nsend out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that\nstate.\"About the cream, or the proprieties?\"I'm a little bit tired of being\none, that's all, and I want to go home.\"\"She wants to go home when she's being so truly delightful and\ncryptic,\" David said.\"Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my\nhearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting\nher gloves to her fingers.\"I don't know exactly what it was I saw,\nbut it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the\ncreeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I\nhave a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,\ndearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of\nFrankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she's\ngoing to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I\nwouldn't say this to anybody but you, David.\"As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of\nowning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,\nhad his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something\nvery precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift\nhad been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more\nsilent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he\nwas dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if\nshe had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,\nbut that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights\nof stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet.\"I had a kind of hunch, too,\" he told her, \"and I felt as if I wanted\nto hear your voice speaking.\"\"If that's the way you feel about your chauffeur,\" she said, \"you\nought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully.\"The difference between a man's moments of prescience and a woman's, is\nthat the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,\nwhile a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more\ncarefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see\nMargaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when\nhe called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone\nagain died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she\nwished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in\nthe most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an\nobsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden\ngasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of\nthe increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut\nprofile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming\nthe airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in\nthe trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea\nthat she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already\ngrown had never actually dawned on him until this moment.\"You look as if you were surprised to", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,\ninto his.\"You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you\nlooked as surprised as if you hadn't expected me at all.\"\"Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her\nskirts to her knees.\"I had forgotten you had grown up any to\nspeak of.\"\"You see me every vacation,\" Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the\nwaiting motor.\"It isn't because you lack opportunity that you don't\nnotice what I look like.It's just because you're naturally\nunobserving.\"\"Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your\nbeing a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been\nrather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of\ntriviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has\ngrown to be a woman now.\"\"Oh, does _he_ think I'm grown up, does he really?\"He's all the time wanting me to get you to\nNew York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller\nthan you were the last time he saw you.\"\"Are they coming to see me this evening?\"\"Jimmie is going to look in.You\nknow she's on here from China with her daughter.\"She must be as grown up as I am,\" Eleanor said.\"I used to have her\nroom, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter.\"Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like\na heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn't know that you\nadded jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.\"\"I'm not jealous,\" Eleanor protested; \"or if I am it's only because\nshe's blood relation,--and I'm not, you know.\"\"It's a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody\nshould ask you,\" David smiled.\"A blood relation is a good deal like\nthe famous primrose on the river's brim.\"\"'A primrose by the river's brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and\nnothing more,'\" Eleanor quoted gaily.\"Why, what more--\" she broke off\nsuddenly and  slightly.\"What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the\nriver's brim?\"I'm a\nmere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your\nAunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don't look\nunlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.\"\"That's because I've got a yellow ribbon on my hat.\"It has something to do with\nyouth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.\"\"The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la,\" Eleanor returned\nsaucily, \"have nothing to do with the case.\"\"She's learning that she has eyes, good Lord,\" David said to himself,\nbut aloud he remarked paternally, \"I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party\ntypes, and ourselves.\"Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,\nwith her hair in a braid.\"She's gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind\nof middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of\nthe same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She's\ngrowing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.\"She'll come to a bad end if\nsomething doesn't stop her.\"\"Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I'm a suffragist, Uncle\nDavid.\"\"And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the\nway she's going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your\nrights and unhealthy ways.Beulah's getting further and further off\nkey, that's all.Your poor old\ncooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.\"\"This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other\nplace does,\" Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly\nupon her.I didn't know he had one,\" David chuckled.\"It takes a\nwoman--\"\n\nJimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound\nbox of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the\nmoment.\"Don't I always place\ntributes at the feet of the offspring?\"\"Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes,\" David said.\"It's only\nthe labels that surprised me.\"\"She knows the difference, now,\" Jimmie answered, \"what would you?\"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should\ngo to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and \"seeing\nthe family.\"She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long\nvisits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at\nsuffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the\nshops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently\nwith David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out\nof the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his\nafter-dinner cigar, and watching her.\"I can't seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.\"\"Yes, I'd love it,--if--\"\n\n\"If what, daughter?\"\"I'm going to earn my own living, you know.\"I've got to--in order to--to feel right about things.\"\"Don't you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents\nhave accustomed you?\"\"I love everything you've ever done for me, but I can't go on letting\nyou do things for me forever.\"It doesn't seem--right, that's all.\"\"It's your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious\nvarieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you\nto do good that better may come.I don't know whether I would be better\nfitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real\ncollege.\"I can't think,--I'm stupefied.\"\"Uncle Peter couldn't think, either.\"\"Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?\"\"He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I'll change my\nmind.\"Eleanor, we're all\nable to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided\namong six of us.When did you come to\nthis extraordinary decision?\"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I've never forgotten.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.I told Uncle\nPeter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I\nwant you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe\nthe best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I\nmight be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there\nwould be more use to me than four years at college, but I don't\nknow.\"\"You're an extraordinary young woman,\" David said, staring at her.\"I'm glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how\nextraordinary, but I don't think anything will come of it, my dear.I\ndon't want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you\ndo want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a\npursuit and not as a means to an end.\"Then let's have no more of this nonsense of earning your own\nliving.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.\"Are you really displeased, Uncle David?\"\"I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it's bedtime.If\nyou're going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on\nit immediately.\"Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held\nhigh.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and\nthe tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath.\"I thought perhaps you would understand,\" she said.She had always kissed him \"good night\" until this visit, and he had\nrefrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out\nhis hand to her.\"There is only one way\nfor a daughter to say good night to her parent.\"She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in\nher eyes.\"Why, Eleanor, dear,\" he said, \"did you care?\"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A\nhot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,\naccentuating the clear pallor of her face.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.\"That was a real kiss, dear,\" he said slowly.\"We mustn't get such\nthings confused.I won't bother you with talking about it to-night, or\nuntil you are ready.Until then we'll pretend that it didn't happen,\nbut if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,\nyou are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have\nsomething to say about it; will you remember?\"\"Yes, Uncle David,\" Eleanor said uncertainly, \"but I--I--\"\n\nDavid took her unceremoniously by the shoulders.\"Go now,\" he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII\n\nBEULAH'S PROBLEM\n\n\nPeter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner\nparty for two of her husband's fellow bankers and their wives.After\nthat they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from\nthere to some one of the new dancing \"clubs,\"--the smart cabarets that\nwere forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade\nthe two o'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as\na usual thing enjoy bankers' wives.He was deliberating on the\npossibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the\nplea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister's\nfeelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the\nclimax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his\nshaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the\nroom across the hall--Eleanor's room, he always called it to\nhimself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo\ninterspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather\nuncertain contralto.\"My last girl came from Vassar, and I don't know where to class her.\"\"My last girl--\" and\nbegan at the beginning of the chorus again.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.\"My last girl came from\nVassar,\" which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of\nthe higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her\nthat he had had with Jimmie and David the night before.\"She's off her nut,\" Jimmie said succinctly.\"It's not exactly that\nthere's nobody home,\" he rapped his curly pate significantly, \"but\nthere's too much of a crowd there.She's not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she's\ngot nothing else in her head.\"It's what hasn't happened to her that's addled her,\" David explained.\"It's these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to\npieces under the modern pressure.They're the ones that need licking\ninto shape by all the natural processes.\"\"By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?\"\"Feminism isn't the answer to\nBeulah's problem.\"\"It is the problem,\" David said; \"she's poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack\nmarried a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,\ntemperament, and everything else, though she wasn't half so nice.She\ngot going the militant pace and couldn't stop herself.I never met her\nat a dinner party that she wasn't tackling somebody on the subject of\nman's inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they're\nthinking now of taking her to the--\"\n\n\"--bug house,\" Jimmie finished cheerfully.\"And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed\nnothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.\"\"The frustrate matron,\" David agreed gravely.\"I wonder you haven't\nrealized this yourself, Gram.You're keener about such things than I\nam.Beulah is more your job than mine.\"\"You're the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle\nher some day and see what you can do.\"Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline,\" Jimmie said.\"I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself\nseriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry\nabout,\" Peter persisted.\"Are you sure she's in bad shape--that she's\ngot anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its\nmost virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.\"\"She's batty,\" Jimmie nodded gravely.\"Go up and look her over,\" David persisted; \"you'll see what we mean,\nthen.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his\nface, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he\nhad an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to\nsee Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to\nhis friend.He had always felt that he saw\na little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the\nenergy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him\nsomething alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her\nsoundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to\nDavid.\"Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see\nBeulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to\ntry out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that\nit's serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So'm I, to tell\nthe truth.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.\"And so am I,\" Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the\nreceiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the\nladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and\ndecided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the\nthin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of\nhis effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and\nfound him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided\nthat Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and\ndelusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was\nunthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid\nvitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see\nher.\"Peter,\" she said, \"I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and\ntell them that I've got to go on with my work,--that I can't be\nstopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I\nnever felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and\nI think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world\nthey don't know anything about, that's all.Even if they were right,\nif I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,\nwhat business is it of theirs to interfere?I'm working for the souls\nand bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if\nmy soul and body suffer?Peter\nobserved the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her\nlips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones.\"Because,\" he answered her slowly, \"I don't think it was the original\nintention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything\nwe are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.\"\"That isn't the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can\nunderstand.It's woman's equality we want emphasized, just literally\nthat and nothing more.You've pauperized and degraded us long\nenough--\"\n\n\"Thou canst not say I--\" Peter began.\"Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to\nit.\"\"I had to get her going,\" Peter apologized to himself, \"in order to\nget a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear,\" he\nadded aloud.\"If you throw your influence with us instead of against us,\" she\nconceded, \"you're helping to right the wrong that you have permitted\nfor so long.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.\"Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and\nI admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your\nbattle now is all over but the shouting.There's no reason that you\npersonally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign\nthat's practically won already.\"\"If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,\nPeter,--\"\n\n\"I don't.I know the thousand and one activities you women are\nconcerned with.I know how much better church and state always have\nbeen and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they\nthrow their strength right.\"Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and\nwell for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and\nJimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her\nstate of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as\nusual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical\nincoherence.\"I have a right to live my own life,\" she concluded, \"and\nnobody--nobody shall stop me.\"\"We are all living our own lives, aren't we?\"\"No woman lives her own life to-day,\" Beulah cried, still excitedly.\"Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right\nto treat her as an imbecile.\"How about the suffrage states, how about the women\nwho are already in the proud possession of their rights and\nprivileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to\nyour theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in\ntwo shakes,--so what's devouring you, as Jimmie says?\"\"It's after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will\nreally begin,\" Beulah answered wearily.\"It's the habit of wearing the\nyoke we'll have to fight then.\"\"The anti-feminists,\" Peter said, \"I see.Beulah, can't you give\nyourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?\"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to\nsteady a tremulous lower lip.\"I am tired,\" she said, a little piteously, \"dreadfully tired, but\nnobody cares.\"\"They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or\nmy failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,\nthat's all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d'Arc how\nmany people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn't\nbelieve in what she believed in?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.\"I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position\nof women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she's not\ngoing to.\"Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty.\"She's so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like\nso much dead weight.\"\"I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you,\" Peter mused,\n\"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You'll find she won't fail you if you need her.\"\"I shan't need her,\" Beulah said, prophetically.\"I hoped she'd stand\nbeside me in the work, but she's not that kind.She'll marry early and\nhave a family, and that will be the end of her.\"\"I wonder if she will,\" Peter said, \"I hope so.She still seems such\na child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don't you?\"I made a vow once that I would never\nmarry and I've always believed that it would be hampering and limiting\nto a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there\nare going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born\nof the women who are fighting to-day.\"\"It doesn't make any difference why\nyou believe it, if you do believe it.\"\"It makes all the difference,\" Beulah said, but her voice softened.\"What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,\nPeter.\"I understand your point of view, Beulah.You\ncarry it a little bit too far, that's all that's wrong with it from my\nway of thinking.\"\"Will you help me to go on, Peter?\"Tell them that they're all wrong in\ntheir treatment of me.\"\"I think I could undertake to do that\"--Peter was convinced that a\nless antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more\nsuccessful--\"and I will.\"\"You're the only one who comes anywhere near knowing,\" she said, \"or\nwho ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don't\nseem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it's\nnecessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,\nevery one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and\nopposed at every turn.\"Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,\"\nPeter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult\nthan he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and\nsubstance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and\ndiscounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the\ninterest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to\nthe cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for\nthe struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of\nbalanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming\nourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health\nand morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him\nwith the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming\nhelpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously\nresponsible for Beulah's condition.\"She wouldn't have run herself so far aground,\" he thought, \"if I had\nbeen on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer\nstraighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come\nthrough all right.Now something's got to stop her or she can't be\nstopped.She'll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the\nsubject of equal guardianship,--and--\"\n\nBeulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the\ndepths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been\ntensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears.\"You're the only one that knows,\" she sobbed over and over again.\"I'm so tired, Peter, but I've got to go on and on and on.If they\nstop me, I'll kill myself.\"Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm.\"Don't cry, dear,\" he said, with a hand on her head.\"You're too tired\nto think things out now,--but I'll help you.\"She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of\nthe dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the\nresemblance.\"I think I see the way,\" he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms.\"I think this will be the way, dear,\" he said very gently.\"Does this mean that you want me to marry you?\"she whispered, when\nshe was calmer.\"I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I've thought\nit all out.--Oh!<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.\"I had no idea of that,\" he said gravely, \"but it's wonderful that\nyou do.I'll put everything I've got into trying to make you happy,\nBeulah.\"Her arms closed around his neck and\ntightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost\nasleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his\ntenderness.\"I didn't know it could be like this,\" she whispered.In his heart he was saying, \"This is best.It\nis the right and normal way for her--and for me.\"In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not\nsharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and\nyellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung\nin two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was\nbent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her\nconfession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man\nwho had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way\nbetween Eleanor's lids and splashed down upon her letter.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.CHAPTER XIX\n\nMOSTLY UNCLE PETER\n\n\n\"Dear Uncle Peter,\" the letter ran, \"I am very, very homesick and\nlonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole\nyear of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking\ninstead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and\nwrite you about the thing that is troubling me.I can't bear it alone\nany longer, and still I don't know whether it is the kind of thing\nthat it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much\ntroubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way\nthat it is terrible to think of.\"Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have\ngrown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my\ndearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a\nnew woman, or have 'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man' that\nyou're always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once\nand for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn't, and\nnever has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are\nnot hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be\nmarried, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to\nanybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and\nyou in quite another way.Please don't try to imagine what I mean,\nUncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don't\nknow.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven't written\nyou this letter.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.I know people do tell things like this, but I don't\nknow quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have\nsomebody like you who understands everything--everything.\"Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by\nwhen the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until\nthat happens, I've got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find\nsome way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don't know\nhow to tell him.I don't know how to make him feel that I do not\nbelong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but\nI don't know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it\nalready.I can't say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks\nthere is something different about her, but I think there are ways in\nwhich I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly\nwhat it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only\nthat, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I\nthink and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a\nwoman's soul that she must keep inviolate.\"A liberty that you haven't known how, or had the strength to prevent,\nis a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in\nmy life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I\nthink of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I\ndon't want them to, I don't think there would be any way of my bearing\nit.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out\nof this tangle.I don't see what it could be, but lots of times you\nhave shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up\ntroubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same.\"Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were\nhere to-night, though you wouldn't be let in, even if you beat on the\ngate ever so hard, for it's long after bedtime.I am up in my tower\nroom all alone.*       *       *       *       *\n\nEleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope\nto Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits.\"I haven't any real right to\ntell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling.\"She began another letter to him but found she could not write without\nsaying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There\nwas nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had\nmade her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet\nspell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome\ncaress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half\nforgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She\nunderstood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,\nbut that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle\nDavid.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange\nincredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her\nlips.\"It's--it's--like that,\" she said to herself.\"I want it to be from\nsomebody--else.Somebody that would make it\nseem right.\"She felt that she\nmust get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any\nman.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate\nthe way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand\n\"the value of a dollar,\" was properly equipped to do battle with the\nrealities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to\nit--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded\nif she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had\nbestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity\nof her economic position; now that the complication of her relation\nwith David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly\nuncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration\nfrightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or\ntroubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and\nalmost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow\naccustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had\nlooked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation\nfollowing the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but\nDavid relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving\nher in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with\nMademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five\nof her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,\nshe soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and\nnormal perspective.David's attitude to her was as simple as ever, and\nwhen she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the\nmatter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the\ngroup.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with\nthem.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting\nfor her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she\nlooked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very\nnewly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she\nwas soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun,\" she wrote in her diary.\"He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good\nmany new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs\nas if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and\nteases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a\nstudio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the\nthree, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle\nJimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking\ninto the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him\nwhen we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at\nme, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in\nmy school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens.\"I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday\nand Friday,--four days of my vacation.We've been to the Hippodrome\nand Chinatown,", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "I shall never forget\nthat night, and I don't think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing\nme about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never\nseem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about\ntaking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must\nhave telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he\nwould, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time\ntalks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very\nlittle better than not seeing him at all.There is a shadow over him that I do not understand.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Don't you think that Uncle Peter has changed?\"she asked Jimmie,\nwhen the need of speaking of him became too strong to withstand.\"He is a little pale about the ears,\" Jimmie conceded, \"but I think\nthat's the result of hard work and not enough exercise.He spends all\nhis spare time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping and\ngetting out on his horse the way he used to.He's doing a good job on\nthe old dear, but it's some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding--\"\n\n\"Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?\"Eleanor's lips were dry,\nbut she did her best to make her voice sound natural.It seemed\nstrange that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition of affairs\nthat made her very heart stand still.\"I didn't know that Uncle Peter\nhad been taking care of her.\"\"Taking care of her isn't a circumstance to what Peter has been doing\nfor Beulah.You know she hasn't been right for some time.She got\nburning wrong, like the flame on our old gas stove in the studio when\nthere was air in it.\"\"Uncle David thought so the last time I was here,\" Eleanor said, \"but\nI didn't know that Uncle Peter--\"\n\n\"Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to tumble.Dave and I got\nalarmed about the girl and held a consultation, with the result that\nDoctor Gramercy was called.If we'd believed he would go into it quite\nso heavily we might have thought again before we sicked him on.It's\nvery nice for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as they said when\nthe lady was deposited on that already overcrowded bosom.Now Beulah's\ngot suffrage mania, and Peter's got Beulah mania, and it's a merry\nmess all around.\"You haven't seen much of him since you came, have\nyou?--Well, the reason is that every afternoon as soon as he can get\naway from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked 'Votes for\nWomen,' and trundles Beulah around in her little white and green\nperambulator, trying to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks\nto her gently and persuasively upon the subject.Suffrage is the only\nsubject on her mind, he explains, so all he can do is to try to cuckoo\ngently under it day by day.It's a very complicated process but he's\nmaking headway.\"\"I'm glad of that,\" Eleanor said faintly.I don't see her very often, either.\"It was Jimmie's turn to look self-conscious.\"She never has time for me any more; I'm not high-brow enough for her.She's getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting everywhere.\"She gave me a cast of her faun's head.\"She is, I guess, but don't let's waste all our valuable time talking\nabout the family.Let's talk about us--you and me.You ask me how I'm\nfeeling and then I'll tell you.Then I'll ask you how you're feeling\nand you'll tell me.Then I'll tell you how I imagine you must be\nfeeling from the way you're looking,--and that will give me a chance\nto expatiate on the delectability of your appearance.I'll work up\ndelicately to the point where you will begin to compare me favorably\nwith all the other nice young men you know,--and then we'll be off.\"Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle a little.\"We shall indeed,\" he assured her solemnly.No, on second\nthoughts, I'll begin.I'll begin at the place where I start telling\nyou how excessively well you're looking.I don't know, considering its\nsource, whether it would interest you or not, but you have the biggest\nblue eyes that I've, ever seen in all my life,--and I'm rather a judge\nof them.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.\"All the better to eat you with, my dear,\" Eleanor chanted.He shot her a queer glance from under his eyebrows.\"I don't feel very safe when I look into them, my child.It would be a\nfunny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me, wouldn't\nit?--well,--but away with such nonsense.I mustn't blither to the very\nbabe whose cradle I am rocking, must I?\"\"I'm not a babe, Uncle Jimmie.Peter says\nthat you even disconcert him at times, when you take to remembering\nthings out of your previous experience.\"\"'When he was a King in Babylon and I was a Christian Slave?'\"Only I'd prefer to play the part of the King of Babylon, if\nit's all the same to you, niecelet.How does the rest of it go, 'yet\nnot for a--' something or other 'would I wish undone that deed beyond\nthe grave.'Gosh, my dear, if things were otherwise, I think I could\nunderstand how that feller felt.Get on your hat, and let's get out\ninto the open.My soul is cramped with big potentialities this\nafternoon.I wish you hadn't grown up, Eleanor.You are taking my\nbreath away in a peculiar manner.No man likes to have his breath\ntaken away so suddint like.Let's get out into the rolling prairie of\nCentral Park.\"But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.The Park had that\npeculiar bleakness that foreruns the first promise of spring.The\nchildren, that six weeks before were playing in the snow and six weeks\nlater would be searching the turf for dandelions, were in the listless\nbetween seasons state of comparative inactivity.There was a deceptive\nbalminess in the air that seemed merely to overlay a penetrating\nchilliness.\"I'm sorry I'm not more entertaining this afternoon,\" Jimmie\napologized on the way home.\"It isn't that I am not happy, or that I\ndon't feel the occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious; I'm\nsilent upon a peak in Darien,--that's all.\"\"I was thinking of something else, too,\" Eleanor said.\"I didn't say I was thinking of something else.\"\"People are always thinking of something else when they aren't talking\nto each other, aren't they?\"\"Something else, or each other, Eleanor.I wasn't thinking of\nsomething else, I was thinking--well, I won't tell you exactly--at\npresent.\"I'm afraid I couldn't--buy joy, even if you gave me your penny, Uncle\nJimmie.\"My penny might not be like other pennies.On the other\nhand, your thoughts might be worth a fortune to me.\"\"I'm afraid they wouldn't be worth anything to anybody.\"\"You simply don't know what I am capable of making out of them.\"\"I wish I could make something out of them,\" Eleanor said so\nmiserably that Jimmie was filled with compunction for having tired her\nout, and hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home again.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending all his time with Aunt\nBeulah,\" she wrote in her diary that evening.\"It is beautiful of him\nto try to help her through this period of nervous collapse, and just\nlike him, but I don't understand why it is that he doesn't come and\ntell me about it, especially since he is getting so tired.He ought to\nknow that I love him so dearly and deeply that I could help him even\nin helping her.It isn't like him not to share his anxieties with me.Aunt Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and doctors and\nnurses, and every one knows her need.It seems to me that he might\nthink that I have no one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy on\nmy heart I could only confide in him.Why doesn't it occur to him that I might have something to\ntell him now?He needs a good deal of exercise to\nkeep in form.If he doesn't have a certain amount of muscular\nactivity his digestion is not so good.There are two little creases\nbetween his eyes that I never remember seeing there before.I asked\nhim the other night when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head\nached, and he said 'no,' but Aunt Beulah said her head ached almost\nall the time.Of course, Aunt Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter\nis trying to bring her back to normality again she is important to\nhim, and that makes her important to me for his sake also, but nobody\nin the world is worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter.\"I suppose it's a part of his great beauty that he should think so\ndisparagingly of himself.I might not love him so well if he knew just\nhow dear and sweet and great his personality is.It isn't so much what\nhe says or does, or even the way he looks that constitutes his charm,\nit's the simple power and radiance behind his slightest move.He doesn't think he is especially fine or beautiful.He doesn't know what a waste it is when he spends his strength upon\nsomebody who isn't as noble in character as he is,--but I know, and it\nmakes me wild to think of it.My\nvacation is almost over, and I don't see how I could bear going back\nto school without one comforting hour of him alone.\"I intended to write a detailed account of my vacation, but I can not.Uncle Jimmie has certainly tried to make me happy.I could have so much fun with him if I were not worried about\nUncle Peter!\"Uncle David says he wants to spend my last evening with me.We are\ngoing to dine here, and then go to the theater together.I am going to\ntry to tell him how I feel about things, but I am afraid he won't give\nme the chance.Life is a strange mixture of things you want and can't\nhave, and things you can have and don't want.It seems almost disloyal\nto put that down on paper about Uncle David.I do want him and love\nhim, but oh!--not in that way.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.There is only one\nperson in a woman's life that she can feel that way about.Why--why--why doesn't my Uncle Peter come to me?\"CHAPTER XX\n\nTHE MAKINGS OF A TRIPLE WEDDING\n\n\n\"Just by way of formality,\" David said, \"and not because I think any\none present\"--he smiled on the five friends grouped about his dinner\ntable--\"still takes our old resolution seriously, I should like to be\nreleased from the anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years\nago this November.I have no announcement to make as yet, but when I\ndo wish to make an announcement--and I trust to have the permission\ngranted very shortly--I want to be sure of my technical right to do\nso.\"Jimmie exclaimed in a tone of such genuine\nconfusion that it raised a shout of laughter.\"We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding you as a congenital\ncelibate anyway,\" Jimmie answered.\"Some day soon you will understand how much you wronged me,\" Peter\nsaid with a covert glance at Beulah.\"I wish I could say as much,\" Jimmie sighed, \"since this is the hour\nof confession I don't mind adding that I hope I may be able to soon.\"\"We've the makings of a triple\nwedding in our midst.Look into the blushing faces before us and hear\nthe voice that breathed o'er Eden echoing in our ears.This is the\nmost exciting moment of my life!Girls, get on your feet and drink to\nthe health of these about-to-be Benedicts.Up in your chairs,--one\nslipper on the table.Gertrude had seen Margaret's sudden pallor and heard the convulsive\ncatching of her breath,--Margaret rising Undine-like out of a filmy,\npale green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply in the\nshadows than usual.Her quick instinct to the rescue was her own\nsalvation.\"On behalf of my coadjutors,\" he said, \"I thank you.All this is\nextremely premature for me, and I imagine from the confusion of the\nother gentlemen present it is as much, if not more so, for them.Personally I regret exceedingly being unable to take you more fully\ninto my confidence.The only reason for this partial revelation is\nthat I wished to be sure that I was honorably released from my oath of\nabstinence.You fellows say something,\" he concluded,\nsinking abruptly into his chair.\"Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian,\" Jimmie murmured.\"I've got nothing to say, except that I wish I had something to say\nand that if I _do_ have something to say in the near future I'll\ncreate a real sensation!When Miss Van Astorbilt permits David to link\nher name with his in the caption under a double column cut in our\nleading journals, you'll get nothing like the thrill that I expect to\ncreate with my modest announcement.I've got a real romance up my\nsleeve.\"There is no Van Astorbilt in mine.\"\"The lady won't give me her permission to speak,\" Peter said.\"She\nknows how proud and happy I shall be when I am able to do so.\"\"It is better we should marry,\" she said.\"I didn't realize that when\nI exacted that oath from you.It is from the intellectual type that\nthe brains to carry on the great work of the world must be\ninherited.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.I'll destroy it to-night and then we may all consider\nourselves free to take any step that we see fit.It was really only as\na further protection to Eleanor that we signed it.\"\"Eleanor will be surprised, won't she?\"Three\nself-conscious masculine faces met her innocent interrogation.\"_Eleanor_,\" Margaret breathed, \"_Eleanor_.\"\"I rather think she will,\" Jimmie chuckled irresistibly, but David\nsaid nothing, and Peter stared unseeingly into the glass he was still\ntwirling on its stem.\"Eleanor will be taken care of just the same,\" Beulah said decisively.\"I don't think we need even go through the formality of a vote on\nthat.\"\"Eleanor will be taken care of,\" David said softly.The Hutchinsons' limousine--old Grandmother Hutchinson had a motor\nnowadays--was calling for Margaret, and she was to take the two other\ngirls home.David and Jimmie--such is the nature of men--were\ndisappointed in not being able to take Margaret and Gertrude\nrespectively under their accustomed protection.\"I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude,\" Jimmie said reproachfully as she\nslipped away from his ingratiating hand on her arm.\"I thought I should take you home to-night, Margaret,\" David said;\n\"you never gave me the slip before.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.\"The old order changeth,\" Gertrude replied lightly to them both, as\nshe preceded Margaret into the luxurious interior.\"It's Eleanor,\" Gertrude announced as the big car swung into Fifth\nAvenue.\"Jimmie or David--or--or both are going to marry Eleanor.Didn't you\nsee their faces when Beulah spoke of her?\"\"David wants to marry Eleanor,\" Margaret said quietly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.\"I've known it\nall winter--without realizing what it was I knew.\"\"Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?\"\"Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?\"it doesn't make any difference,--we're losing them just the same.\"\"No matter what combinations come\nabout, we shall still have an indestructible friendship.\"\"Indestructible friendship--shucks,\" Gertrude cried.\"The boys are\ngoing to be married--married--married!Marriage is the one thing that\nindestructible friendships don't survive--except as ghosts.\"\"It should be Peter who is going to marry Eleanor,\" Margaret said.\"It's Peter who has always loved her best.\"As a friend,\" Beulah said, \"as her dearest friend.\"\"Not as a friend,\" Margaret answered softly, \"she loves him.Of\ncourse, it must be Peter who is going to marry her.\"\"If it isn't we've succeeded in working out a rather tragic\nexperiment,\" Margaret said, \"haven't we?\"\"Life is a tragic experiment for any woman,\" Gertrude said\nsententiously.\"Peter doesn't intend to marry Eleanor,\" Beulah persisted.\"Do you happen to know who he is going to marry?\"\"Yes, I do know, but I--I can't tell you yet.\"\"Whoever it is, it's a mistake,\" Margaret said.\"It's our little\nEleanor he wants.I suppose he doesn't realize it himself yet, and\nwhen he does it will be too late.He's probably gone and tied himself\nup with somebody entirely unsuitable, hasn't he, Beulah?\"\"I don't know,\" Beulah said; \"perhaps he has.I hadn't thought of it\nthat way.\"\"It's the way to think of it, I know.\"Margaret's eyes filled with\nsudden tears.\"But whatever he's done it's past mending now.There'll\nbe no question of Peter's backing out of a bargain--bad or good, and\nour poor little kiddie's got to suffer.\"\"Beulah took it hard,\" Gertrude commented, as they turned up-town\nagain after dropping their friend at her door.The two girls were\nspending the night together at Margaret's.I think besides being devoted to Eleanor, she feels terrifically\nresponsible for her.I can't pretend to think of anything else,--who--who--who--are\nour boys going to marry?\"\"I always thought that you and David--\"\n\nMargaret met her eyes bravely but she did not answer the implicit\nquestion.\"I always thought that you and Jimmie--\" she said presently.Gertrude, you would have been so good for him.\"it's all over now,\" Gertrude said, \"but I didn't know that a\nliving soul suspected me.\"Gertrude whispered as they clung to each\nother.I've never seen any one else whom I thought that of.I--I was so\nused to him.\"\"That's the rub,\" Gertrude said, \"we're so used to them.They're\nso--so preposterously necessary to us.\"Late that night clasped in each other's arms they admitted the extent\nof their desolation.Life had been robbed of a magic,--a mystery.The\nsolid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding was the\nbackground of so much lovely folly, so many unrealized possibilities,\nso many nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution of\ntheir circle was an unthinkable calamity.\"We ought to have put out our hands and taken them if we wanted them,\"\nGertrude said, out of the darkness.They need to be firmly\nturned in the right direction instead of being given their heads.\"I wouldn't pay that price for love,\" Margaret said.By\nthe time I had made it happen I wouldn't want it.\"\"That's my trouble too,\" Gertrude said.Then she turned over on her\npillow and sobbed helplessly.\"Jimmie had such ducky little curls,\"\nshe explained incoherently.\"I do this sometimes when I think of them.Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after Gertrude's breath began\nto rise and fall regularly, she lay staring wide-eyed into the\ndarkness.CHAPTER XXI\n\nELEANOR HEARS THE NEWS\n\n\n\"Dear Uncle Jimmie:\n\n\"I said I would write you, but now that I have taken this hour in\nwhich to do it, I find it is a very, very hard letter that I have got\nto write.In the first place I can't believe that the things you said\nto me that night were real, or that you were awake and in the world of\nrealities when you said them.I felt as if we were both dreaming; that\nyou were talking as a man does sometimes in delirium when he believes\nthe woman he loves to be by his side, and I was listening the same\nway.It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.I can't help\nfeeling that your idea of me is a dream idea, and the pain that you\nsaid this kind of a letter would give you will be merely dream pain.It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find that all the lovely\nways we felt, and delicately beautiful things we had, were only dream\nthings that we wouldn't even understand if we were thoroughly awake.\"In the second place, you can't want to marry your little niecelet,\nthe funny little 'kiddo,' that used to burn her fingers and the\nbeefsteak over that old studio gas stove.We had such lovely kinds of\nmake-believe together.That's what our association always ought to\nmean to us,--just chumship, and wonderful and preposterous _pretends_.I couldn't think of myself being married to you any more than I could\nJack the giant killer, or Robinson Crusoe.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.You're my truly best and\ndearest childhood's playmate, and that is a great deal to be, Uncle\nJimmie.I don't think a little girl ever grows up quite _whole_ unless\nshe has somewhere, somehow, what I had in you.You wouldn't want to\nmarry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?There are some kinds of\nplaymates that can't marry each other.I think that you and I are that\nkind, Uncle Jimmie.\"My dear, my dear, don't let this hurt you.How can it hurt you, when\nI am only your little adopted foster child that you have helped\nsupport and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?I love you so\nmuch,--you are so precious to me that you _must_ wake up out of this\ndistorted, though lovely dream that I was present at!Nobody can break our hearts if we are strong\nenough to withhold them.Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find\nthe way to be our bravest all the time.I know that what you are\nfeeling now is not real.I can't tell you how I know, but I do know\nthe difference.They could be pulled up\nwithout too terrible a havoc.\"Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me.I said this would be a\nhard letter to write, and it has been.If you could see my poor\ninkstained, weeping face, you would realize that I am only your funny\nlittle Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously at all.I hope\nyou will come up for my graduation.When you see me with all the other\nlumps and frumps that are here, you will know that I am not worth\nconsidering except as a kind of human joke.\"Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie that Margaret\nspending a week-end in a town in Connecticut adjoining that in which\nEleanor's school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her\novernight at the inn where she was staying.She had really planned the\nentire expedition for the purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her\nfor the revelations that were in store for her, though she was\nostensibly meeting a motoring party, with which she was going on into\nthe Berkshires.She started in abruptly, as was her way, over the salad and cheese in\nthe low studded Arts and Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road\nhouse, contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty woman in new\nsporting clothes.\"Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are going to be married,\" she\ntold her.\"No, I didn't,\" Eleanor said faintly, but she grew suddenly very\nwhite.David gave a dinner party one night last\nweek in his studio, and announced his intentions, but we don't know\nthe name of the lady yet, and we can't guess it.He says it is not a\nsociety girl.\"\"Who do you think it is, Eleanor?\"\"I--I can't think, Aunt Margaret.\"\"We don't know who Jimmie is marrying either.The facts were merely\ninsinuated, but he said we should have the shock of our lives when we\nknew.\"\"Perhaps he has changed his mind by now,\" Eleanor said.Don't you think it might be that they both just\nthought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn't want to\nmarry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.\"Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had\nanticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the\nsensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to\ntell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from\nthe pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have\nbeen shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were\nconnecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity\nnightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in\nMargaret's memory for many years.\"It would have been easier to tell\nher in her street clothes,\" she thought.\"I wish her profile were not\nso perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely\nthing?\"\"The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now\nthat I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn't show my\nfeelings through.Haven't you noticed how much more like other people\nI've grown, Eleanor?\"\"You've grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don't think you're\nvery much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.\"\"I have though,--every one notices it.You haven't asked me anything\nabout Peter yet,\" she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor's cheeks for an instant.\"I haven't heard from him for a\nlong time.\"\"He's looking better than he was for\na while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor.\"He\nsaid that he hadn't the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We're as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.\"\"It's Aunt Beulah,\" Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of\nher.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face\nand a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it.\"I don't think it's Beulah,\" Margaret said.\"Beulah knows who it is,\nbut I never thought of it's being Beulah herself.\"\"If she knows--then she's the one.He wouldn't have told her first if\nshe hadn't been.\"\"Don't let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It's--it's pain to us all.\"\"Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?\"\"Yes, dear,\" Margaret smiled at her bravely.\"And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?\"\"She has for a good many years, I think.\"She\npushed Margaret's arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard.\"Don't touch me,\" she cried, \"I can't bear it.You might not want\nto--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw\nher head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,\nas if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in\nthe night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from\nthe room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of\nexhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape.\"Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train,\" the clerk\nsaid, \"and left this note for Miss Hutchinson.\"It was like Eleanor to\ndo things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dear Aunt Margaret,\" her letter ran.\"My grandmother used to say that\nsome people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid\nthat is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder.\"I've been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,\nand I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don't think I have any right to\ntell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found\nto be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such\nbeautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each\nother, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little\nblinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the\nway, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt\nMargaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go\nwrong.I was so young, I didn't know how to manage.I shall never be\nthat kind of young again.\"You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one\nelse know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,\ndon't you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange\nit so they wouldn't try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me\nnaturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the\nriver, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won't be\nany use in trying to find me.I couldn't\never bear seeing one of your faces again.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.Don't let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don't want him\nto know,--I

station, Margaret ascertained,\nbut the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him\nand told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a\nlank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with\nEleanor's charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his\nattitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure\nmade Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to\nproceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the\nschool, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school\noffice and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a\nsomewhat lame story to account for Eleanor's absence and promised the\nauthorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a\npromise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not\nkeep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the\nothers.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor\nhad left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,\nthey faced David and Jimmie.\"She went away,\" Margaret told them, \"both because she felt she was\nhurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.\"\"I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,\"\nMargaret answered deliberately.\"If that is true,\" he said, \"then I am largely responsible for her\ngoing.\"\"It is I who am responsible,\" Jimmie groaned aloud.\"I asked her to\nmarry me and she refused me.\"\"I asked her to marry me and didn't give her the chance to refuse,\"\nDavid said; \"it is that she is running away from.\"\"It was Peter's engagement that was the last straw,\" Margaret said.\"The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I\ntold her that.\"\"The damned hound--\" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.\"Eleanor says it's Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think\nthat she's probably right.\"\"That would be a nice mess, wouldn't it?\"\"Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of\njudgment, Margaret?<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.I don't covet the sweet job of breaking it to\neither one of them.\"Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that\nsame afternoon at Beulah's apartment.And in response to the halting\nexplanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done\ntheir best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he\nonly said, \"I don't see that it makes any difference why she's gone.She's gone, that's the thing that's important.No matter how hard we\ntry we can't really figure out her reason till we find her.\"\"Are you sure it's going to be so easy?\"She's a pretty determined little person when she\nmakes up her mind.Eleanor's threats are to be taken seriously.\"I'll find her if she's anywhere in the world,\" Peter said.\"I'll find\nher and bring her back.\"\"Find out the reason that she\nwent away, too, Peter.\"\"She had some one else\non her mind, hadn't she?\"\"She had something else on her mind,\" Gertrude answered gravely, \"but\nshe had Peter on her mind, too.\"\"She didn't--she couldn't have known about us--Peter and me.We--we\nhaven't told any one.\"It's\njust one of God's most satirical mix-ups.\"\"I was to blame,\" Beulah said slowly.\"I don't believe in shifting\nresponsibility.I got her here in the first place and I've been\ninstrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I've sacrificed her\nto my own happiness.\"\"It isn't so simple as that,\" Gertrude said; \"the things we start\ngoing soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has\nbeen directing Eleanor's affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for\nthat matter.\"\"Don't worry, Beulah,\" Peter said, making his way to her side from", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "\"You\nmustn't let this worry you.We've all got to be--soldiers now,--but\nwe'll soon have her back again, I promise you.\"\"And I promise you,\" Beulah said chokingly, \"that if you'll get her\nback again, I--I will be a soldier.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding\nout the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly\nto her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine\noffice, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt\nalmost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund\nin her name started some years before for the defraying of her college\nexpenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even\nthough she felt constrained to pay it back later on.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the\nFans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of\nbeauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans\nas confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's\nmausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen\nenemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the\nhearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the\npeople, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these\nlast-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by\nthe Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the\nmural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such\nbarbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in\nwitchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of\nX-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of\nMayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating\nthat he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die\nunless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from\nmalarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of\ntapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my\nadvice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,\nprobably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched\nhim.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial\ndistinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an\nincredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he\nsimply replied: \"No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me.\"Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of\nEquatorial Africa, says: \"The greatest curse of the whole country is the\nbelief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with\nthe belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.He\nbecomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and\nreally often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per\ncent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery.\"In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards\nbecause of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the\nchroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious\nlibations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the\ncelebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the\nbark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left\nto ferment.The nectar drank by\nthe God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,\na city in which he resided for some time, says: \"Next day he was so much\nelated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a\nfermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen\nill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it\npieces of bark of a certain tree_.\"(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find\nthat the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with\nthe MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to\nbe a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,\nwhere they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,\nmen and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief\nthat their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been\nsacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the\ntombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade\nor profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered\nround the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend\nto suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for\nthey believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their\nvillages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is\nno longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of\ndrums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the\naborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to\nleave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about\nfour feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave\nbetween them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches\nfrom the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to\nform, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two\nballs of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the\ninstrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it\ncan be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm\nweather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the\ntrunk of a tree.On one end a piece of\nskin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,\nthe instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a\nslanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case\nof danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,\nand is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of\nthese _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and\ndescribes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas\nas follows: \"The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in\ndiameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed\nout quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the\ndrummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks\nbeats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the\ncylinder.\"We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of\nthe ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African\ntowns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages\nin Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at\ntimes the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause\nthe wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry\nwith him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had\nbetter deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the\ncross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently\ndedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an\ninfinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the\nvillages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the\nnative dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of\nmore appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: \"The pure bred\nnative dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly\ntail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being\nknown by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept\nvery short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;\nI don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already\nmentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close\nit by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists\namong the African warriors: \"_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the\nwarrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._\"\n\nLet us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in\nthe foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to\nbe well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and\npowerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their\nattainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have\nreached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;\nfor we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their\nlanguage scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants\nthey apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they\ngave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions\nof the mother country, and the history of the founders of their\nnationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have\nestablished large settlements soon after leaving the land of their\nbirth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,\nwrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored\nimaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to\nhide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their\nsuperstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over\nthem, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the\nchildren astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of\nthe devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of\nthe hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and\npalaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,\nBurmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an\nelephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to\nexclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those\nwho enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and\nthe inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were\ninformed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the\n_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language \"she\nwho places ropes across the roads to impede the passage.\"Even the\nhistory of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by\nthe god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and\ntheir marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed\nby their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back\nwith a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of\nHindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still\nlive and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They\nleft behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere\nfantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we\nknow so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living\namong them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,\nthey have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a\ncertainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are\npure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the\nfeatures of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on\nthe walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits\nrecall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the\nSpanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,\nreached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the\nPersian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded\ntheir primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur\n(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave\nthemselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their\ncity: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have\nseen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive\nChaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange\ncoincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly\nwhen we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)\nand their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were\ngreat architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of\nthem but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved\nof the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the\ntablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty\nthat, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight\nlines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or\nparallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And\nfrom the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was\nidentical with that of many personages represented in the mural\npaintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the\nCARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among\nthe populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:\nbut their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan\nat the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_\nor _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we\nmight well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those\nparts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and\nhistorians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We\nhave seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of\nTyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more\nI could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas\nand the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned\nmen of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of\ntheir ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had\nemigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the\nChinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the\nrising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of\nCAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests\nin the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its\ndetails.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their\nsister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members\nof the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching\napotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL\nand MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the\nrelations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we\nlearn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to\ndoubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the\nAmenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the\nancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a\n_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted\nskin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: \"That the skin is\nusually represented without the head; but some instances where this is\nintroduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_.\"Again, the\nname of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in\nhieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye\nabove it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a\n_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in\nthe land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a\n_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his\ntotems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the\nskin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior\nwhose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are\nin Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a\npiece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;\nwhose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place\nof the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National\nMuseum of Mexico.ISIS was the wife and sister of Osiris.As to the etymology of her name\nthe Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the\nAmenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same\ncharacters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign\nof the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always\nportrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it\nwere, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is\nrepresented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya\nlanguage); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us\nthat she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;\nreading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the\nform of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his\ntreatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the\nthrone, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to\nrepresent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the\nsun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,\nand to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three\nthrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at\nUxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and\nCHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their\nflayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_\nas his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called\nthe place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the\nQueen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to\nthe _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as\nin Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this\nenmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to\nhave been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high\npontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn\nfrom the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as\ntrophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent\nbust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains\nare concealed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the\nwife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to\nhis embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been\ndiscovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the\nanger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the\nname of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with\nwhose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the\nmonuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to\ndiffer, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the\nEgyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means\nflower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,\nexists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,\nMacedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of\nChaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is\nrepresented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the\nextraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,\nhis sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the\npreceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of\nreckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs\nunder the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient\ndivinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the\nlower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the\ndead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of\nwriting his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,\nreads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,\nsince, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,\nto perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to\nscatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at\nthe foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of\nwhich I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a\nsitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were\nplaced three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a\nplatform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the\ncynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the\nprincipal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the\nkneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient\ncity was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon\n(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her\nhome, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen\nthe royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is\nsymbolical of her domestic happiness.Before\nher is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness\nof his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral\nqualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood\nphrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to\nseduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her\nextended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest\nread her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the\nman, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and\nthreatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen\nat a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is\nanother serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded\nabout the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue\nprotruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing\nfrom its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the\nmyth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the\nwoman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render\nthem invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which\nChaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known\nto their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had\nimagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being\nwounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not\nlaugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still\nprevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed\nduring the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of\npaper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic\nwords or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be\npossessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by\nwearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the\nPope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and\nother misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did\nnot receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational\nconclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing\nbut their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its\netymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told\nthat, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established\nhimself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book\nwhere mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise\nmagician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura\n(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the\nSanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call\nthemselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are\nwords belonging to the American Maya language.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst\nthe Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in\nHindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,\nwhere we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a\ngoddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that\nshe was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to\nthe lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a\ncountry called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a\nsieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its\ninhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called\nthemselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their\nhieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a\n_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to\nindicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants\nof the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,\nwere people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual\ncharacter used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with\nthe sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent\nmen and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they\nundoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they\nemigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their\ninhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it\nin to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was\nconsidered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and\nGreece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization\nfrom the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores\nand customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them\nat some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and\nbeliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This\nappears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures\nsculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly\ndiscernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the\ncelebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced\nby many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their\ncivilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that\nI have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians\nwere identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites\nand habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed\ntowards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as\ngods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still\nin MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective\nantiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by\nthe Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.\nWell, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists\nstill a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of\nthese columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the\nlife of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened\nbetween the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of\nthe uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the\nstructure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the\nthirty-sixth column.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.How long did that event occur before the Spanish\nconquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take\nplace at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years\nsince, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being\nfinished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the\nnation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will\nremark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third\nperson of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his\nfinger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the\nword is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which\nthey computed time, says:\n\n\"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books\nevery twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these\nlustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,\nwhich means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "When seven of these stones have\nthus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after\nthe first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of\nthe big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more\nthey placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the\nnorth; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they\nput a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus\nfinished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years.\"There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the\nmonuments of Mayab:\n\n1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that\ntheir builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices\nfronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,\nsince _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol\nof deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been\ncontemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became\nseparated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and\ntheir colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what\nPsenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon\n\"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian\nlegislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the\nlands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night,\" then we may\nbe able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America\nand their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,\nthat after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of\n_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the\nstones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of\nthe vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,\nthe full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,\nthe possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the\n_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the\nspeculations which invalidate all books published on the subject\nheretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has\nnot been lost;

she was\ndesired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to\nmaintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five\nweeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,\nand our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George\nEvelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the\nLords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital\ndesigned to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a\ndesign to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street\nleading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the\nQueen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a\nmourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred\npoor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded\nand covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,\naldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,\nwho related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,\nwhich was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,\nwho were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was\nfound wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any\nextraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This\npaper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent\nthings under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were\nvery small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in\nany private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for\ntaking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo\nthe renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought\nat the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was\nthe very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I\nbelieve in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.James's;\nbut the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was\nlet fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's \"Britannia\" was now published (by Bishop\nGibson), with great additions;

and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to\nCalais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army\nin readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection\nhere, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,\nKing James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered\nby some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could\napprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,\nwere taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,\ncongratulate the discovery;

but so it pleased God that Admiral\nRooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,\nwith others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,\nand were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could\nbe got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look\non it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of\nGod.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design\nof assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his\nfriends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King\nWilliam.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so\nmany of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding\ntheir design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and\nDunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they\nwere so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their\nmasts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to\nhave invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,\nwhereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate\nthe King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of\ninciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and\nsome very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John\nFriend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at\nTemple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was\nsuch at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles\nII., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]\n\n    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into\n    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who\nabsolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)\nwas a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to\nthe canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee\nabout settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years\na more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the\nKing's House at Kensington.The\ngallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of\nTitian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,\nTintoretto, and others;

the Duke\nhad leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the\nDukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,\nbut very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now\nDuke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as\ncommissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment\nof the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great\nmeasure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others\nof little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without\nsuspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member\nof either House should be in the commission.The great contest between\nthe Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and\nrejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King\nCharles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass\nrather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was\ncarried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the\nCourt, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph\nof the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and\nthose to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,\nthat things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this\nnation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are\nsatisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side\nheaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too\nfar.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if\none turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass\nto his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only\nthe usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the\nindiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public\nprocessions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers\nplaces (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their\nparty.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of\nJersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,\nSecretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord\nChancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of\nvotes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This\nbeing in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers\nrefusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in\nthis fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a\nmost excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior\npen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is\nsaid to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in\nplace in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and\nliberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their\njealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which\nprotected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,\nand a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on\nwhich depended an estate of L1,500 a year;

but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and\nsolitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign\ncountry, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,\nholly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,\nmazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so\nthat I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren\ncondition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John\nEvelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement\nby the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady\nreceived us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of\nArchbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and\nvenerable;

at which were\npresent above twenty domestics.The old man leaped from his couch of rushes at the thrilling news, and,\nstanding on his threshold, uttered a low gathering-cry, which speedily\nbrought a dozen of his more immediate retainers to his presence.As he\npassed his daughter\u2019s apartment, he for the first time asked himself who\ncan the woman be?and at the same moment almost casually glanced at\nNorah\u2019s chamber, to see that all there was quiet for the night.A shudder\nof vague terror ran through his sturdy frame as his eye fell on the low\nopen window.He thrust in his head, but no sleeper drew breath within; he\nre-entered the house and called aloud upon his daughter, but the echo of\nher name was the only answer.A kern coming up put an end to the search,\nby telling that he had seen his young mistress walking down to the\nwater\u2019s edge about an hour before, but that, as she had been in the habit\nof doing so by night for some time past, he had thought but little of it.The odious truth was now revealed, and, trembling with the sudden gust of\nfury, the old chief with difficulty rushed to the lake, and, filling a\ncouple of boats with his men, told them to pull for the honour of their\nname and for the head of the O\u2019Rourke\u2019s first-born.During this stormy prelude to a bloody drama, the doomed but unconscious\nConnor was sitting secure within the dilapidated chapel by the side\nof her whom he had won.Her quickened ear first caught the dip of an\noar, and she told her lover; but he said it was the moaning of the\nnight-breeze through the willows, or the ripple of the water among the\nstones, and went on with his gentle dalliance.A few minutes, however,\nand the shock of the keels upon the ground, the tread of many feet, and\nthe no longer suppressed cries of the M\u2019Diarmods, warned him to stand on\nhis defence; and as he sprang from his seat to meet the call, the soft\nillumination of love was changed with fearful suddenness into the baleful\nfire of fierce hostility.\u201cMy Norah, leave me; you may by chance be rudely handled in the scuffle.\u201d\n\nThe terrified but faithful girl fell upon his breast.\u201cConnor, your fate is mine; hasten to your boat, if it be not yet too\nlate.\u201d\n\nAn iron-shod hunting pole was his only weapon; and using it with his\nright arm, while Norah hung upon his left, he sprang without further\nparley through an aperture in the wall, and made for the water.But his\nassailants were upon him, the M\u2019Diarmod himself with upraised battle-axe\nat their head.\u201cSpare my father,\u201d faltered Norah; and Connor, with a mercifully\ndirected stroke, only dashed the weapon from the old man\u2019s hand, and\nthen, clearing a passage with a vigorous sweep, accompanied with the\nwell-known charging cry, before which they had so often quailed, bounded\nthrough it to the water\u2019s brink.An instant, and with her who was now\nmore than his second self, he was once more in his little boat; but,\nalas!it was aground, and so quickly fell the blows against him, that he\ndare not adventure to shove it off.Letting Norah slip from his hold,\nshe sank backwards to the bottom of the boat; and then, with both arms\nfree, he redoubled his efforts, and after a short but furious struggle\nsucceeded in getting the little skiff afloat.Maddened at the sight, the\nold chief rushed breast-deep into the water; but his right arm had been\ndisabled by a casual blow, and his disheartened followers feared, under\nthe circumstances, to come within range of that well-wielded club.But\na crafty one among them had already seized on a safer and surer plan.He had clambered up an adjacent tree, armed with a heavy stone, and now\nstood on one of the branches above the devoted boat, and summoned him to\nyield, if he would not perish.The young chief\u2019s renewed exertions were\nhis only answer.\u201cLet him escape, and your head shall pay for it,\u201d shouted the infuriated\nfather.\u201cMy young mistress?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are enough here to save her, if I will it.Down with the stone, or\nby the blood----\u201d\n\nHe needed not to finish the sentence, for down at the word it came,\nstriking helpless the youth\u2019s right arm, and shivering the frail timber\nof the boat, which filled at once, and all went down.For an instant\nan arm re-appeared, feebly beating the water in vain--it was the young\nchief\u2019s broken one: the other held his Norah in its embrace, as was seen\nby her white dress flaunting for a few moments on and above the troubled\nsurface.The lake at this point was deep, and though there was a rush of\nthe M\u2019Diarmods towards it, yet in their confusion they were but awkward\naids, and the fluttering ensign that marked the fatal spot had sunk\nbefore they reached it.The strength of Connor, disabled as he was by\nhis broken limb, and trammelled by her from whom even the final struggle\ncould not dissever him, had failed; and with her he loved locked in his\nlast embrace, they were after a time recovered from the water, and laid\nside by side upon the bank, in all their touching, though, alas, lifeless\nbeauty!Remorse reached the rugged hearts even of those who had so\nruthlessly dealt by them; and as they looked on their goodly forms, thus\ncold and senseless by a common fate, the rudest felt that it would be\nan impious and unpardonable deed to do violence to their memory, by the\nseparation of that union which death itself had sanctified.Thus were\nthey laid in one grave; and, strange as it may appear, their fathers,\ncrushed and subdued, exhausted even of resentment by the overwhelming\nstroke--for nothing can quell the stubborn spirit like the extremity of\nsorrow--crossed their arms in amity over their remains, and grief wrought\nthe reconciliation which even centuries of time, that great pacificator,\nhad failed to do.The westering sun now warning me that the day was on the wane, I gave but\nanother look to the time-worn tombstone, another sigh to the early doom\nof those whom it enclosed, and then, with a feeling of regret, again left\nthe little island to its still, unshared, and pensive loneliness.ANCIENT IRISH LITERATURE--No.The composition which we have selected as our fourth specimen of the\nancient literature of Ireland, is a poem, more remarkable, perhaps,\nfor its antiquity and historical interest, than for its poetic merits,\nthough we do not think it altogether deficient in those.It is ascribed,\napparently with truth, to the celebrated poet Mac Liag, the secretary of\nthe renowned monarch Brian Boru, who, as our readers are aware, fell at\nthe battle of Clontarf in 1014; and the subject of it is a lamentation\nfor the fallen condition of Kincora, the palace of that monarch,\nconsequent on his death.The decease of Mac Liag, whose proper name was Muircheartach, is thus\nrecorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 1015:--\n\n\u201cMac Liag, i. e. Muirkeartach, son of Conkeartach, at this time laureate\nof Ireland, died.\u201d\n\nA great number of his productions are still in existence; but none of\nthem have obtained a popularity so widely extended as the poem before us.Of the palace of Kincora, which was situated on the banks of the Shannon,\nnear Killaloe, there are at present no vestiges.LAMENTATION OF MAC LIAG FOR KINCORA.A Chinn-copath carthi Brian?And where is the beauty that once was thine?Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate\n    At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine?Oh, where are the Dalcassians of the Golden Swords?[1]\n    And where are the warriors that Brian led on?And where is Morogh, the descendant of kings--\n    The defeater of a hundred--the daringly brave--\n    Who set but slight store by jewels and rings--\n    Who swam down the torrent and laughed at its wave?And where is Donogh, King Brian\u2019s worthy son?And where is Conaing, the Beautiful Chief?they are gone--\n    They have left me this night alone with my grief!And where are the chiefs with whom Brian went forth,\n    The never-vanquished son of Evin the Brave,\n    The great King of Onaght, renowned for his worth,\n    And the hosts of Baskinn, from the western wave?Oh, where is Duvlann of the Swiftfooted Steeds?And where is Kian, who was son of Molloy?And where is King Lonergan, the fame of whose deeds\n    In the red battle-field no time can destroy?And where is that youth of majestic height,\n    The faith-keeping Prince of the Scots?--Even he,\n    As wide as his fame was, as great as was his might,\n    Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to me!They are gone, those heroes of royal birth,\n    Who plundered no churches, and broke no trust,\n    \u2019Tis weary for me to be living on the earth\n    When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust!Oh, never again will Princes appear,\n    To rival the Dalcassians of the Cleaving Swords!I can never dream of meeting afar or anear,\n    In the east or the west, such heroes and lords!Oh, dear are the images my memory calls up\n    Of Brian Boru!--how he never would miss\n    To give me at the banquet the first bright cup!why did he heap on me honour like this?I am Mac Liag, and my home is on the Lake:\n    Thither often, to that palace whose beauty is fled,\n    Came Brian to ask me, and I went for his sake.that I should live, and Brian be dead![1] _Coolg n-or_, of the swords _of gold_, i. e. of the _gold-hilted_\nswords.\u201cBiography of a mouse!\u201d cries the reader; \u201cwell, what shall we have\nnext?--what can the writer mean by offering such nonsense for our\nperusal?\u201d There is no creature, reader, however insignificant and\nunimportant in the great scale of creation it may appear to us,\nshort-sighted mortals that we are, which is forgotten in the care of\nour own common Creator; not a sparrow falls to the ground unknown and\nunpermitted by Him; and whether or not you may derive interest from the\nbiography even of a mouse, you will be able to form a better judgment,\nafter, than before, having read my paper.The mouse belongs to the class _Mammalia_, or the animals which rear\ntheir young by suckling them; to the order _Rodentia_, or animals whose\nteeth are adapted for _gnawing_; to the genus _Mus_, or Rat kind, and the\nfamily of _Mus musculus_, or domestic mouse.The mouse is a singularly\nbeautiful little animal, as no one who examines it attentively, and\nwithout prejudice, can fail to discover.Its little body is plump and\nsleek; its neck short; its head tapering and graceful; and its eyes\nlarge, prominent, and sparkling.Its manners are lively and interesting,\nits agility surprising, and its habits extremely cleanly.There are\nseveral varieties of this little creature, amongst which the best known\nis the common brown mouse of our granaries and store-rooms; the Albino,\nor white mouse, with red eyes; and the black and white mouse, which is\nmore rare and very delicate.I mention these as _varieties_, for I think\nwe may safely regard them as such, from the fact of their propagating\nunchanged, preserving their difference of hue to the fiftieth generation,\nand never accidentally occurring amongst the offspring of differently\n parents.It is of the white mouse that I am now about to treat, and it is an\naccount of a tame individual of that extremely pretty variety that is\ndesigned to form the subject of my present paper.When I was a boy of about sixteen, I got possession of a white mouse; the\nlittle creature was very wild and unsocial at first, but by dint of care\nand discipline I succeeded in rendering it familiar.The principal agent\nI employed towards effecting its domestication was a singular one, and\nwhich, though I can assure the reader its effects are speedy and certain,\nstill remains to me inexplicable: this was, ducking in cold water; and by\nresorting to this simple expedient, I have since succeeded in rendering\neven the rat as tame and as playful as a kitten.It is out of my power to\nexplain the manner in which _ducking_ operates on the animal subjected to\nit, but I wish that some physiologist more experienced than I am would\ngive his attention to the subject, and favour the public with the result\nof his reflections.At the time that I obtained possession of this mouse, I was residing at\nOlney, in Buckinghamshire, a village which I presume my readers will\nrecollect as connected with the names of Newton and Cowper; but shortly\nafter having succeeded in rendering it pretty tame, circumstances\nrequired my removal to Gloucester, whither I carried my little favourite\nwith me.During the journey I kept the mouse confined in a small wire\ncage; but while resting at the inn where I passed the night, I adopted\nthe precaution of enveloping the cage in a handkerchief, lest by some\nuntoward circumstance its active little inmate might make its escape.Having thus, as I thought, made all safe, I retired to rest.The moment\nI awoke in the morning, I sprang from my bed, and went to examine the\ncage, when, to my infinite consternation, I found it empty!I searched\nthe bed, the room, raised the carpet, examined every nook and corner, but\nall to no purpose.I dressed myself as hastily as I could, and summoning\none of the waiters, an intelligent, good-natured man, I informed\nhim of my loss, and got him to search every room in the house.His\ninvestigations, however, proved equally unavailing, and I gave my poor\nlittle pet completely up, inwardly hoping, despite of its ingratitude\nin leaving me, that it might meet with some agreeable mate amongst its\nbrown congeners, and might lead a long and happy life, unchequered by\nthe terrors of the prowling cat, and unendangered by the more insidious\nartifices of the fatal trap.With these reflections I was just getting\ninto the coach which was to convey me upon my road, when a waiter came\nrunning to the door, out of breath, exclaiming, \u201cMr R., Mr R., I declare\nyour little mouse is in the kitchen.\u201d Begging the coachman to wait an\ninstant, I followed the man to the kitchen, and there, on the hob,\nseated contentedly in a pudding dish, and devouring its contents with\nconsiderable _gout_, was my truant proteg\u00e9.Once more secured within\nits cage, and the latter carefully enveloped in a sheet of strong brown\npaper, upon my knee, I reached Gloucester.I was here soon subjected to a similar alarm, for one morning the cage\nwas again empty, and my efforts to discover the retreat of the wanderer\nunavailing as before.This time I had lost him for a week, when one\nnight, in getting into bed, I heard a scrambling in the curtains, and on\nrelighting my candle found the noise to have been occasioned by my mouse,\nwho seemed equally pleased with myself at our reunion.After having thus\nlost and found my little friend a number of times, I gave up the idea\nof confining him; and, accordingly, leaving the door of his cage open,\nI placed it in a corner of my bedroom, and allowed him to go in and out\nas he pleased.Of this permission he gladly availed himself, but would\nregularly return to me at intervals of a week or a fortnight, and at such\nperiods of return he was usually much thinner than ordinary; and it was\npretty clear that during his visits to his brown acquaintances he fared\nby no means so well as he did at home.Sometimes, when he happened to return, as he often did, in the\nnight-time, on which occasions his general custom was to come into bed to\nme, I used, in order to induce him to remain with me until morning, to\nimmerse him in a basin of water, and then let him lie in my bosom, the\nwarmth of which, after his cold bath, commonly ensured his stay.Frequently, while absent on one of his excursions, I would hear an\nunusual noise in the wainscot, as I lay in bed, of dozens of mice\nrunning backwards and forwards in all directions, and squeaking in much\napparent glee.For some time I was puzzled to know whether this unusual\ndisturbance was the result of merriment or quarrelling, and I often\ntrembled for the safety of my pet, alone and unaided, among so many\nstrangers.But a very interesting circumstance occurred one morning,\nwhich perfectly reassured me.It was a bright summer morning, about four\no\u2019clock, and I was lying awake, reflecting as to the propriety of turning\non my pillow to take another sleep, or at once rising, and going forth to\nenjoy the beauties of awakening nature.While thus meditating, I heard a\nslight scratching in the wainscot, and looking towards the spot whence\nthe noise proceeded, perceived the head of a mouse peering from a hole.It was instantly withdrawn, but a second was thrust forth.This latter I\nat once recognised as my own white friend, but so begrimed by soot and\ndirt that it required an experienced eye to distinguish him from his\ndarker-coated entertainers.He emerged from the hole, and running over\nto his cage, entered it, and remained for a couple of seconds within\nit; he then returned to the wainscot, and, re-entering the hole, some\nscrambling and squeaking took place.A second time he came forth, and on\nthis occasion was followed closely, to my no small astonishment, by a\nbrown mouse, who followed him, with much apparent timidity and caution,\nto his box, and entered it along with him.More astonished at this\nsingular proceeding than I can well express, I lay fixed in mute and\nbreathless attention, to see what would follow next.In about a minute\nthe two mice came forth from the cage, each bearing in its mouth a large\npiece of bread, which they dragged towards the hole they had previously\nleft.On arriving at it, they entered, but speedily re-appeared, having\ndeposited their burden; and repairing once more to the cage, again loaded\nthemselves with provision, and conveyed it away.This second time they\nremained within the hole for a much longer period than the first time;\nand when they again made their appearance, they were attended by three\nother mice, who, following their leaders to the cage, loaded themselves\nwith bread as did they, and carried away their burdens to the hole.After\nthis I saw them no more that morning, and on rising I discovered that\nthey had carried away every particle of food that the cage contained.Nor\nwas this an isolated instance of their white guest leading them forth to\nwhere he knew they should find provender.Day after day, whatever bread\nor grain I left in the cage was regularly removed, and the duration of my\npet\u2019s absence was proportionately long.Wishing to learn whether hunger\nwas the actual cause of his return, I no longer left food in his box; and\nin about a week afterwards, on awaking one morning, I found him sleeping\nupon the pillow, close to my face, having partly wormed his way under my\ncheek.There was a cat in the house, an excellent mouser, and I dreaded lest she\nshould one day meet with and destroy my poor mouse, and I accordingly\nused all my exertions with those in whose power it was, to obtain her\ndismissal.She was, however, regarded by those persons as infinitely\nbetter entitled to protection and patronage than a mouse, so I was\ncompelled to put up with her presence.People are fond of imputing to\ncats a supernatural degree of sagacity: they will sometimes go so far\nas to pronounce them to be genuine _witches_; and really I am scarcely\nsurprised at it, nor perhaps will the reader be, when I tell him the\nfollowing anecdote.I was one day entering my apartment, when I was filled with horror at\nperceiving my mouse picking up some crumbs upon the carpet, beneath\nthe table, and the terrible cat seated upon a chair watching him with\nwhat appeared to me to be an expression of sensual anticipation and\nconcentrated desire.Before I had time to interfere, Puss sprang from\nher chair, and bounded towards the mouse, who, however, far from being\nterrified at the approach of his natural enemy, scarcely so much as\nfavoured her with a single look.Puss raised her paw and dealt him a\ngentle tap, when, judge of my astonishment if you can, the little mouse,\nfar from running away, or betraying any marks of fear, raised himself\non his legs, cocked his tail, and with a shrill and angry squeak, with\nwhich any that have kept tame mice are well acquainted, sprang at and\npositively _bit_ the paw which had struck him.I could\nnot jump forward to the rescue.I was, as it were, petrified where I\nstood.But, stranger than all, the cat, instead of appearing irritated,\nor seeming to design mischief, merely stretched out her nose and smelt\nat her diminutive assailant, and then resuming her place upon the chair,\npurred herself to sleep.I need not say that I immediately secured the\nmouse within his cage.Whether the cat on this occasion knew the little\nanimal to be a pet, and as such feared to meddle with it, or whether its\nboldness had disarmed her, I cannot pretend to explain: I merely state\nthe fact; and I think the reader will allow that it is sufficiently\nextraordinary.In order to guard against such a dangerous encounter for the future,\nI got a more secure cage made, of which the bars were so close as to\npreclude the possibility of egress; and singularly enough, many a morning\nwas I amused by beholding brown mice coming from their holes in the\nwainscot, and approaching the cage in which their friend was kept, as if\nin order to condole with him on the subject of his unwonted captivity.Secure, however, as I conceived this new cage to be, my industrious pet\ncontrived to make his escape from it, and in doing so met his death.In\nmy room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "On returning, I opened the drawer,\nand just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my\npoor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up\nhis body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to\nanimation.His little body had been crushed\nin the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been\nendeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *\n\nNOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers\nas may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little\nanimals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage\nout daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in\nwinter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the\nmice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as\ntoo moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to\nproduce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with\nimpunity.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat\nor barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little\ntin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely\nfixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,\nor too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves\nbetween them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals\nare fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,\nwould quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the\nbird-shops in Patrick\u2019s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage\nmakers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,\nwhose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about\nKnightsbridge.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence\nper pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would\nall utter the one cry, \u201cwe are overstocked;\u201d and echo would reply\n\u201coverstocked.\u201d This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody\nseems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own\npart--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is\nloudest in exclaiming \u201cdear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep\nhere!\u201d never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own\nperson from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from\nthe utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already\nin the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many \u201cvanities and vexations of spirit\u201d under the sun, but this\nevil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to\nno purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the \u201cexcess\u201d\nfrom applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are\nthe primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the\nloss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be\nowing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it\nstrikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people\npay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of\nblanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;\nbut in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is\nnothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the\nenvy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared\nwith the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to\nenjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a\nprovision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general\neducation, professional education, and then of admission to \u201cliberty to\npractise;\u201d and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,\nthey conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost\nthem \u201cthus much monies.\u201d But unfortunately they soon learn by experience\nthat the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always\npossess that homely recommendation of causing the \u201cpot to boil,\u201d and that\nthe individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so\nsoon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,\nnamely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a\ncertain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these \u201cpiping\ntimes of peace,\u201d a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to\nverify the old song, and\n\n    \u201cSpend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,\u201d\n\nas an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation\nmonies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et\nceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any\ncomfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other\nsource, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the\nhands of the paymaster.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,\nand of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by\ncircumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the\nmistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently\nadmitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.The usual\nresult is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,\nafter incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is\nobliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the\nunprofitable profession of arms.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other\nprofessions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of\nthe bar, that \u201cmany are called but few are chosen;\u201d but with very few and\nrare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however\nsmall, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and\nconnections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his\nmind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from\nday to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,\nwithout any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast\nproportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so\nconstantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question\nis, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an\noverstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to\nenter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no\nunnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty\u2019s\nsubjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain\nsituations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable\nchannels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal\nprofession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can\nafford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to\nbear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such\nit is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they\nthink proper.But it will be asked, what is to\nbe done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,\nif this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably\nspent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive\npursuits, would insure them a \u201cgood location\u201d and a certain provision\nfor life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable\noccupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to\n\u201cprofessions\u201d which, however \u201cliberal,\u201d hold out to the many but a very\ndoubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among\ncertain of my countrymen that \u201ctrade\u201d is not a \u201cgenteel\u201d thing, and\nthat it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes\nalso, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of\nwhich we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high\nclassical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our\nschools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a\nmatter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,\nas surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is\nnourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising\nthose parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in\nthe professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their\nchildren, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less\nelegant but more useful accomplishment of \u201cciphering.\u201d I am disposed to\nconcur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the\ninestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,\nin our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every\nthing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly\nrecommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is\nno encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there\nwere, there would be no necessity for me to recommend \u201cciphering\u201d and\nits virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers\nits prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who\nwait for a \u201chighway\u201d to be made for them.If people were resolved to\nlive by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,\nthan at present operate successfully in that department.If more of\neducation, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources\nof profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover\nthemselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter\nfurther into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint\nwhich may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small\nfarmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it\nis.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to\nChristmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to\nwhich they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear\nto offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and\naccommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of\npoultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to\nthe rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor\nIrish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth\nwhile to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having\nascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great\ndecrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one\nindividual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas\nand Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that\nanother dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as\nmany: these they purchase in lots from the farmers\u2019 wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to\nsome of the readers of this Journal:--\n\nThe farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent\nof suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the\nfertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a\nhigher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number\nof goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all\ncasualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on\nwhich, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,\nas it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;\nand this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with\nstimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,\ntwenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after\nbringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the\nbirds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three\nshillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,\non which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,\ngenerally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or\nlarger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in\norder to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if\nwith reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be\nsuperfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various\nworks on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the\npractice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great\ndealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,\nand condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio\nof one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to\ncleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened\nin about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,\ndescribed by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of\nblinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated\ncasks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),\nare happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,\nwith one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal\nproofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese\nbrought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported\nones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets\nof barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their\ngeese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,\nbesides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and\nrather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the\nvast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year\nfor the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which\ngives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this\nbusiness, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural\ncountrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the\nstock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,\nand in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or\nfeed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be\nless frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when\nthe geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the\ncramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This\nopinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which\nleads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when\nthey are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,\nand that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give\nthem, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of\ncondition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett\nused to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,\ncarrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as\nfarinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience\nof such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory\nand conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of\npotatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not\nif it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of\ncramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general\ndisinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese\nalive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three\ntimes in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation\ntwice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,\nthe geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the\nbirds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the\npluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three\ntimes in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said\nthat the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature\nsuggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great\nnumbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground\nwould be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be\njustified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,\nwe have many recorded facts; among them the following:--\u201cIn 1824 there\nwas a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near\nMarket Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It\nhad been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson\u2019s\nforefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer\nit to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the\nin-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on\nthe spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.\u201d\n\nThe taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a\ngoose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause\nits enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high\nand forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well\nknown; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in\nproducing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for\ngeese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it\nwould appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but\nin another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--\u201cThe production of\nflesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for\nexample, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the\nactivity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed\ninto fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress\nof respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions\nnecessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in\nquadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an\nexcessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of\nthe animal.\u201d\n\nWe are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for\nthe market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of\ngeese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be\nthe chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many\nparts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our\nagricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese\nin localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of\nconversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the\npublic mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also\nhope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish\nmanufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to\nthose of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be\ndeemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;\nand, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce\nfor themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get \u201cthe London\nstamp\u201d upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the\ncase of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures\nare rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to\nour knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually\nat the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many\nof those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into\n\u201cOuld Ireland,\u201d and are bought as English by those who would despise\nthem as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in\nthis way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and\nin like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,\nwithout waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity\nfor such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists\nequally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so\nhighly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them\nby wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the\nfavour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we\nmay refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor\nhas been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of\n_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled \u201cA\nshort chapter on Bustles,\u201d but which he gives as written for the said\nCourt Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,\nand we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and\nkind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no\ndoubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks\nago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,\nbut as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court\nGazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to\nconsider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own\nJournal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the\nconsistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the\ncause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be\ncompatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.*       *       *       *       *\n\n    Printed and published every Saturday by

Vol.As I have quoted before, he says: \"The time has passed\nwhen we can wrap ourselves in a cloak of professional dignity and assume\nan attitude of infallibility toward the public.\"Such sentiment freely\nexpressed would, I believe, soon change the attitude of the laity toward\nphysicians from one which is either suspicion or open hostility to one of\nrespect and sympathy.The argument has been made by physicians that it would not do for the\npublic to read all their discussions and descriptions of diseases, as\ntheir imagination would reproduce all the symptoms in themselves.Others\nhave urged that it will not do to let the public read professional\nliterature, for they might draw conclusions from the varied opinions they\nread that would not be for the good of the profession.Both arguments\nremind one of the arguments parents make as an excuse for not teaching\ntheir children the mysteries of reproduction.They did not want to put\nthoughts into the minds of their children that might do them harm.At the\nsame time they should know that the thoughts would be, and were being, put\ninto their children's minds from the most harmful and corrupting sources.Are not all symptoms of disease put before the people\nanyway, and from the worst possible sources?If medical men do not know\nthis, let them read some of the ads.And are\nthe contradictions and inconsistencies in discussions in medical journals\nkept from the public?If medical men think so, let them read the\nOsteopathic and \"independent\" journals.The public knows too much already,\nconsidering the sources from which the knowledge comes.Since people will\nbe informed, why not let them get information that is authentic?Before I studied the literature of leading medical journals I believed\nthat the biggest and brainiest physicians were in favor of fair and frank\ndealing with the public.I had learned this much from observation and\ncontact with medical men.After a careful study of the organ of the\nAmerican Medical Association my respect for that organization is greatly\nincreased by finding expressions in numbers of articles which show that my\nopinion was correct.In spite of all the vituperation that is heaped upon\nit, and in spite of the narrowness of individual members, the American\nMedical Association does seem to exist for the good of humanity.The\nstrongest recommendation I have found for it lies in the character of the\nschools and individuals who are most bitter against it.It is usually\ncomplimentary to a man to have rascals array themselves against him.There are many able men among physicians who feel keenly their\nlimitations, when they have done their best, and this class would gladly\nhave their patients understand the limitations as well as the powers of\nthe physician.In sorrow and disgust sometimes the conscientious physician\nrealizes that he is handicapped in his work to either prevent or cure\ndisease, because he has to work with people who have wrong notions of his\npower and of the potency of agencies he employs.With shame he must\nacknowledge that the people hold such erroneous ideas of medicine, not\nbecause of general ignorance, but because they have been intentionally\ntaught them by the army of quacks outside and the host of grafters and\nincompetents _inside_ the regular medical profession.Incompetent physicians, to succeed financially (and that is the only idea\nof success incompetents are capable of appreciating), must practice as\nshysters.They fully understand how necessary it is to the successful\nworking of their grafts to keep the people in ignorance of what a\nphysician may legitimately and conscientiously do.Our medical brethren who preach the \"all but holy\" doctrine, and want to\nmaintain the \"attitude of infallibility toward the public,\" will disagree\nwith me about there being \"a host\" of incompetents in the regular school\nof medical practice.I shall not ask that they take the possibly biased\nopinion of an ex-Osteopath, but refer them to the report of the committee\nappointed by the American Medical Association to examine the medical\ncolleges of the United States as to their ability to make competent\nphysicians.\"One-half of all the medical schools of our country are\nutterly unfit to turn out properly qualified physicians, and many of them\nare so dominated by commercialism that they are but little better than\ndiploma mills\"!It has been argued that the capable physician need not fear the\nincompetent pretender, for, like dregs, he must \"settle to the bottom\" and\nfind his place.This might be true if the people had correct notions of\nthe true theory of therapeutics.As it is, the scholarly, competent\nphysician knows (and intelligent laymen often know) that the pretenders\ntoo often are the fellows who get the reputations of being the \"big\ndoctors.\"I think mainly because, being ignorant, they practice\nlargely as quacks, and by curing (?)all kinds of dangerous (on their own\ndiagnosis) diseases quickly, \"breaking up\" this and \"aborting\" that\nunbreakable and unabortable disease (by \"hot air\" treatment mainly), they\nplace the whole system upon such a basis of quackery that the deluded\nmasses often pronounce the best equipped and most conscientious physician\na \"poor doctor,\" because he will not pretend to do all that the\nwind-jamming grafter claims _he has_ done and _can_ do.Here is a case in point which I know to be true.The farce began some\nyears ago in a small college in Oregon.A big, awkward, harmless-looking\nfellow came to the college one fall and entered the preparatory\ndepartment.At the end of the year, after he had failed in every\nexamination and shown conclusively that he had no capacity to learn\nanything, he was told that it was a waste of time for him to go to school,\nand they could not admit him for another year.The fires of ambition yet burned in his breast, and the next year he\nturned up at a medical college.I presume it had the same high educational\nrequirements for admission that some other medical colleges have, and\nenforced them in about the same way.At any rate he met the requirements\n($$$), and pursued his medical researches with bright visions of being a\ndoctor to lure him on.But his inability to learn anything manifested\nitself again, and, presumably, his money gave out.At any rate he was sent\naway without a diploma.Still the fire of ambition was not extinguished in\nhis manly bosom.Regulations were not strict in those days, so he went to\na small town, wore fine clothes, a silk hat and a pompous air, and--within\na short time was being called for forty miles around to \"counsel little\ndoctors\" in their desperate cases.Such cases are all too common, as\nhonest physicians know.How humiliating to the conscientiously equipped doctor to hear people say\nof a man who never had more brains than he needed, and had hopelessly\nmuddled what he had by using his own dope and stimulants: \"I tell you Doc\nBooze is the best doctor in town yet when he's half sober!\"Strange, isn't\nit, that in many communities people have an idea that an inclination on\nthe part of a physician toward whisky or dope indicates some peculiar\nmental fitness for a doctor?\"Poor fellow, he formed the habit of taking\nstimulants to keep up when he had to go night and day during the big\ntyphoid epidemic, you know.\"of cases of medical\ndipsomaniacs this constitutes a stock excuse, only medical men know.As an\nOsteopathic physician I was never rushed so that I felt the necessity for\n\"keeping up on stimulants.\"If I had been, to be consistent, I should have\nhad to stimulate (?)Not only do shysters and pretenders abuse the confidence of the masses in\nmatters of diagnosis and medication, but of late years they are working\nanother species of graft that is beginning to react against the\nprofession.This graft consists in the over-use of therapeutic appliances\nthat are all right in their place when legitimately used.By what standard is the physician judged by the people who enter his\noffice?It used to be the display of medical literature.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Sometimes some of\nit was pseudo-medical literature.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.Did you ever know a shyster to pad his\nlibrary with Congressional reports?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.The literature used to be\nconspicuously placed in the waiting-room, with a ponderous volume lying\nopen on the desk.Have you a \"leading doctor\" in your town?Often he is not only in the lead\nbut has flagged all the others at the quarter post--put them all into the\n\"has been\" class.Plush rugs and luxurious\ncouches in the waiting-room.Double doors into the private and\noperating-rooms, left open when not in actual use to give impressive\nglimpses of glass cases filled with glittering instruments, any one of\nwhich would give the lie to Solomon's declaration that \"there is nothing\nnew under the sun.\"In the\nsame room are tanks, tubes, inhalers, hot-air appliances, vibrators, etc.One full side of the room is filled with shelves that groan under a load\nof the medicines he \"keeps and dispenses.\"What are all of these hundreds\nof bottles for if it is true, as many of our greatest physicians say, that\na comparatively few people are benefited by drugs?I do not know as to that, but I do know something of\nthe impression such a display makes on the mind of an intelligent layman.The query in his mind is how much of that entire display is for its\nlegitimate effect on the minds of the patients, and how much of it is to\nimpress the people with the powers of this physician, with his \"wonderful\nequipment\" to cope with all manner of disease?If there is any doubt in the minds of physicians that laymen do know and\nthink well over the sayings of drug nihilists, let them talk with\nintelligent people and hear them quote from the editorial page of a great\ndaily such sentiments as this (from the Chicago _Record-Herald_):\n\n    \"Prof.William Osier, the distinguished teacher of medicine, who was\n    taken from this country a few years ago to occupy the most important\n    medical chair in Great Britain, has shocked his profession repeatedly\n    by his pronouncements against the use of drugs and medicines of almost\n    every kind.Only a few", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "The most able physicians agree\n    with him, even when they are not frank enough to express themselves to\n    the same effect.\"Medical men need not think, either, that the people who happened to read\nthe editorial pages referred to are the only ones who know of that\ndeclaration from Osier.Osteopathic journals, Christian Science journals,\nhealth culture journals, and all the riff-raff of journals published as\nindividual boosters, are ever on the watch for just such things, and when\nthey find them they \"roll them under their tongue as sweet morsels.\"They\nchew them, as Carleton says, with \"the cud of fancy,\" and hand them along\nas latest news to tens of thousands of people who are quick to believe\nthem.Going back to the physician who has the well-equipped office, is he a\ngrafter in any sense?Perhaps every thing he\nhas in the office is legitimate.In the opinion of the masses of that\ncommunity he is the greatest doctor that ever prescribed a pill or\npurloined an appendix.Taking the word of the physicians whom he has put\ninto the \"has been\" class for it, he is the greatest fake that ever fooled\nthe people.Most of those outclassed doctors will talk at any time, in any\nplace, to any one, of the pretensions of this type of physician.They will\ntell how he dazzles the people with his display of apparatus \"kept for\nshow;\" how he diagnoses malarial fever as typhoid, and thus gets the\nreputation of curing a larger per cent.of typhoid than any other doctor\nin town; how he gets the reputation of being a big surgeon by cutting out\nhealthy ovaries and appendices, and how he assists with his knife women\nwho do not desire Rooseveltian families.They point to the number of\nappendectomies he has performed, and recall how rare such cases were\nbefore his advent, and yet how few people died with appendicitis.Is it to\nbe wondered that intelligent laymen sometimes lose faith in and respect\nfor the profession of medicine and surgery?To show that people may be imposed upon by illegitimate use of legitimate\nagencies I call attention to an article published recently in the _Iowa\nHealth Bulletin_.The Iowa Medical Board is winning admiration from many\nby conducting a campaign to educate the people of the State in matters\npertaining to hygienic living.In line with this work they published an\narticle to correct the erroneous idea the laity have of the X-ray.They\nsay:\n\n    \"The people think that with the X-ray the doctor can look right into\n    the body and examine any part or organ and tell just what is the\n    matter with it, when the fact is all that is ever seen is a lot of dim\n    shadows that even the expert often fails to understand or recognize.\"Why do the people have such erroneous conceptions of the X-ray?Is it\naccidental, or the result of their innate stupidity?The people have just such conceptions of the X-ray as they receive from\nthe faker who uses it as he uses his opiates and stimulants--to get an\neffect and give the people wrong ideas of his power.A lady of a small town who was far advanced in consumption was taken to a\ncity to be examined by a \"big doctor\" who possessed an X-ray.He\n\"examined\" her thoroughly by the aid of the penetrating light made by his\nmachine, and sent them home delighted with the assurance that his\nwonderful instrument revealed no tuberculosis.He assured her that if she\nwould avail herself of his superior skill she might yet be restored to\nhealth.She died within a year from the ravages of tuberculosis.A boy of four had an aggravated attack of bronchitis.His symptoms were\nsuch that his parents thought some object might have lodged in his\ntrachea.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.A noted surgeon who had come one hundred miles from a hospital to\nsee another case was consulted.He told the parents that the boy had\nsucked something down his windpipe, and advised them to bring him to the\nhospital for an operation.They did so, and a $100 incision was made\nafter the X-ray had located (?)an object lodged at the bifurcation of the\ntrachea.The knife found nothing, however, and the boy still had his\nbronchitis, and the parents had their hospital and surgeon's bills, and,\nincidentally, their faith in the X-ray somewhat shattered.The X-rays, Finsen rays, electric light and sunlight have their place in\ntherapy.However, the history\nof the use of these agents is a common one.A scientist, after possibly a\nlifetime of research, develops a new therapeutic agent or a new\napplication of some old agent.Immediately a lot of half-baked professional men seize upon it, more with\nthe object of self-laudation and advertisement than in a true scientific\nspirit.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Serious study in the application of the new agent is not thought\nof.The object is rather to have the reputation of being an up-to-snuff\nman.The results obtained are not what the originator claimed, which is\nnot to be wondered at.The abuse of the remedy leads to abuse of the\noriginator, which is entirely unfair to both.This state of affairs has grown so bad that scientists now are beginning\nto restrict the application of their discoveries to their own pupils.A\nBerlin _savant_, assistant to Koch, has developed the use of tuberculin to\nsuch a point as to make it one of the most valuable remedies in\ntuberculosis.It is manufactured under his personal supervision, and sold\nonly to such physicians as will study in his laboratory and show\nthemselves competent to grasp the principles involved.TURBID THERAPEUTICS.An Astounding Array of Therapeutic\n    Systems--Diet--Water--Optics--Hemotherapy--Consumption\n    Cures--Placebos--Inconsistencies and Contradictions--Osler's Opinion\n    of Appendicitis--Fair Statement of Limitations in Medicine Desirable.To be convinced that therapeutics are turbid, note the increasing numbers\nof diametrically opposed schools springing up and claiming to advocate the\nonly true system of healing.Look at the astounding array:\n\nAllopathy, Homeopathy, Eclecticism, Osteopathy, Electrotherapy, Christian\nScience, Emmanuel movement, Hydrotherapy, Chiropractics, Viteopathy,\nMagnetic Healing, Suggestive Therapeutics, Naturopathy, Massotherapy,\nPhysio-Therapy, and a host of minor fads that are rainbow-hued bubbles for\na day.They come and go as Byron said some therapeutic fads came and went\nin his day.He spoke of the new things that astounded the people for a\nday, and then, as it has been with\n\n  \"Cowpox, tractors, galvanism and gas,\n  The bubble bursts and all is air at last.\"One says he has found that fasting is a panacea.Another says: \"He is a\nfool; you must feed the body if you expect it to be built up.\"One says drinking floods of water is a cure-all.Another says the water is\nall right, but you must use it for the \"internal bath.\"Still another\nagrees that water is the thing, but it must be used in hot and cold\napplications.One faker says _he_ has found that most diseases are caused by defective\neyes, and proposes to cure anything from consumption to ingrown toe-nails\nwith glasses.Another agrees that the predisposing cause of diseases is\neye strain, but the first fellow is irrational in his treatment.Glasses\nare unnatural and therefore all wrong.To cure the eyes use his wonderful\nnature-assisting ointment; that goes right to the optic nerve and makes\nold eyes young, weak eyes strong, relieves nerve strain and thereby makes\nsick people well.Another has found that \"infused\" blood is the real elixir of life.of twenty cases of tuberculosis cured by his\nbeneficent discovery.I wonder why we have a \"Great White Plague\" at all;\nor why we have international conventions to discuss means of staying the\nravages of this terrible disease; or why State medical boards are devoting\nso much space in their bulletins to warn and educate the people against\nthe awful fatality of consumption, when to cure it is so easy if doctors\nwill only use blood?Even if the hemotherapist does claim a little too much, there is yet no\ncause for terror.A leading Osteopathic journal proclaims in large\nletters that the Osteopath can remove the obstruction so that nature will\ncure consumption.Christian Scientists and Magnetic Healers have not yet admitted their\ndefeat, and there are many regulars who have not surrendered to the\nplague.So the poor consumptive may hope on (while his money lasts).Our\nmost conscientious physicians not only admit limitations in curing\ntuberculosis, but try to teach the people that they must not rely on being\n\"cured\" if they are attacked, but must work with the physician to prevent\nits contagion.The intelligent layman can say \"Amen\" to that doctrine.The question may be fairly put: \"Why not have more of such frankness from\nthe physician?\"The manner in which the admissions of doctors that they\nare unable to control tuberculosis with medicine or surgery alone has been\nreceived by intelligent people should encourage the profession.It would\nseem more fair to take the stand of Professor Osler when he says that\nsound hygienic advice for the prevention of diseases must largely take the\nplace of present medication and pretence of cure.As a member of the American Medical Association recently said, \"The\nplacebo will not fool intelligent people always.\"And when it is generally\nknown that most of a physician's medicines are given as placebos, do you\nwonder that the claims of \"drugless healers\" receive such serious\nconsideration?The absurd, conflicting claims of quack pretenders are bad enough to\nmuddle the situation and add to the turbidity of therapeutics; but all\nthis is not doing the medical profession nearly as much harm, nor driving\nas many people into the ranks of fad followers, as the inconsistencies and\ncontradictions among the so-called regulars.This was my opinion before I made any special study of therapeutics, and\nwhile studying I found numbers of prominent medical men who agree with me.One of them says that the \"criticisms,\" quarrels, contradictions, and\ninconsistencies of medical men are doing more to lower the profession in\nthe estimation of the intelligent laity and to cause people to follow the\nfads of \"new schools\" than all else combined.Think for a moment of some of these inconsistencies and contradictions.One doctor in a town tells the people that he \"breaks up\" typhoid fever.His rival, perhaps from the same college, tells the people that typhoid\nmust \"run its course\" and cannot be broken up, and that any man who claims\nthe contrary is a liar and a shyster.One surgeon makes a portion of the\npeople believe he has saved dozens of lives in that community by surgical\noperations; the other physicians of the town tell the people openly, or at\nleast hint, that there has been a great deal of needless butchery\nperformed in that community in the name of surgery.And then the people\nsee editorials in the daily press about the fad of having operations\nperformed, and read in their health culture or Osteopathic journals from\narticles by the greatest M.D.s, in which it is admitted that surgery is\npracticed too largely as a graft.Professor Osler is quoted as saying:\n\n    \"Surgeons are finding altogether too many cases of appendicitis these\n    days.Appendicitis is becoming so common and so easily detected that\n    the physician's wife can diagnose a case of it over the telephone.\"One leading physician says medical treatment has little beneficial effect\non pneumonia; another claims to be able to cure it, and lets the friends\nof his patient rely entirely on his medicine in the most desperate cases.Another says, \"All those clay preparations\nare frauds, and the only safe way to treat pneumonia is by blood letting.\"Thus it goes, and this is only a sample of contradictions that arise in\nthe treatment of diseases.Nor is the above an overdrawn picture.Most of it was from the journal of\nthe editor who said he refused to send it to a layman who had sent his\nmoney in advance.But all that same stuff has been hashed and rehashed to\nthe people through the sources I have already mentioned.There are not\nonly these evidences of inconsistencies to edify (?)the people, but\nconstantly recurring examples of incompetency and pretensions.There is no doubt a middle ground in all this, but it is not evident to\nthe casual observer.If the true physician would honestly admit his\nlimitations to the intelligent laity, much of this muddle would be\navoided.While by such a course he may occasionally temporarily lose a\npatient, in the end both the public and profession would gain.The time\nhas gone by to \"assume an air of infallibility toward the public.\"CHAPTER V.\n\nTHE EXPERT WITNESS AND PROPRIETARY MEDICINES.The \"Great Nerve Specialist\"--The Professional Witness a Jonah--The\n    \"Railway Spine\"--Is it Lack of Fairness and Honesty or Lack of Skill\n

of\n    Proprietary Medicines Stimulates Sale of Nostrums.I wonder what the patrons of the sanitarium of the \"great nerve\nspecialist\" thought of his display of knowledge of the nervous system when\nhe was on the witness stand in a recent notorious case?A lawyer tangled\nhim up completely, and showed that the doctor had no accurate knowledge of\nthe anatomy of the nervous system.When asked the origin of the\nall-important pneumogastric nerve, he _thought_ it originated in a certain\nsegment of the spinal cord!This noted \"specialist\" was made perfectly\ncontemptible, and the whole profession must have blushed in shame at the\nspectacle presented.And that spectacle was not unnoticed by the\nintelligent laity.The professional witness has in most cases been a Jonah to the profession.It is about as easy to get the kind of testimony you want from a\nprofessional witness in a suit for damages for personal injuries as it is\nto get a doctor's certificate to get out of working your poll-tax, or a\ncertificate of physical soundness to carry fraternal life insurance.Let me recall the substance of a paper read a few years ago by perhaps the\ngreatest lawyer in Iowa (afterward governor of that State).He told of a\ntrial in which he had examined and cross-examined ten physicians.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.It was a\ntrial in which suit was brought to recover damages for personal injury, a\ngood illustration of the \"railway spine.\"One physician testified that the\npatient was afflicted with sclerosis of the spinal cord; another said it\nwas a plain case of congestion of the cord; another diagnosed degeneration\nof the cord; yet another said it was a true combination of all the\nconditions named by the first three.They all said there was atrophy of\nthe muscles of the left leg, and predicted that complete paralysis would\nsurely supervene.On the other side five noted physicians testified as positively that\nneither the spinal cord nor any nerve was injured; that there was no sign\nof atrophy or loss of power in the leg; and they seemed to think the\ndisease afflicting the patient was due to a fixed desire to secure a\nverdict for large damages from the railway company.One eminent specialist\nmade oath that the electrical test showed the partial reaction of\ndegeneration; another as famous challenged him to make the test again in\nthe presence of both.After it was made this second specialist went before\nthe jury and positively declared that there was no trace whatever of the\nreaction of degeneration, and that the muscles responded to the current\nprecisely as healthy muscles should.Then this eminent attorney adds: \"If the instances of such diversity were\nrare they might pass unnoticed, but they occur and re-occur as often as\nphysicians are called to the temple of justice for the expression of\nopinions.\"The lay mind imputes this clash of opinions either to lack of fairness and\nhonesty or lack of skill and learning.In either case the profession\nsuffers great injury in the estimation of those who should have for it\nonly the profoundest admiration and the most implicit faith.Again I ask,\nIs it any wonder people have lost implicit faith when they read many\nreports of similar cases rehashed in the various yellow journals put into\ntheir hands?Farmers submitted with all possible grace to the decrees of science when,\nby the authority of such a great man as Koch, their fine herds of cattle\nwere condemned as breeders and disseminators of the great white plague and\ndestroyed without compensation.But how do you think these same farmers\nfeel when they read in yellow journals that Koch has changed his mind\nabout bovine and human tuberculosis being identical, and has serious\ndoubts about the one contracting in any way the disease of the other.People read with renewed hope the glowing accounts of the wonderful\nachievements of Dr.Koch in finding a destroyer for the germ of\nconsumption.Somehow time has slipped by since that renowned discovery,\nwith consumption still claiming its victims, and many physicians are\nsaying \"Koch's great discovery is proving only a great disappointment.\"Drugless therapy journals are continually pouring out the vials of their\nwrath upon vaccination, antitoxin and all the serum tribe, and their\nvituperation is even excelled by vindictive denunciations of the same\nthings by the individual boomer journals that flood the land.Another bitter contention that is confusing some, and disgusting others,\nis the acrimonious strife between users and non-users of proprietary\nmedicines.This usually develops into a sort of \"rough house\" affair, the\ndruggist mixing up as savagely as the doctors before the fight is\nfinished.I know nothing of the rights or wrongs of the case nor of the\nmerits or demerits of proprietary medicines, but I do know this, however:\nThe stupendous sale of nostrums that in 1907 represented a sum of money\nsufficient to have provided every practitioner of medicine in the United\nStates with a two thousand dollar salary, has been helped by the use of\nproprietary medicines.I am aware that my position is likely to be called\nin question by many physicians.But they should hear druggists arguing\nwith people who hesitate about buying patent medicines because their\nphysicians tell them they should seldom take medicine unless prescribed by\na doctor.They would hear him say: \"Your doctor gives you medicines that\nare put up in quantities for him just as these patent medicines are put up\nfor us.\"He then produces literature and proves it--at least beyond the\nrefutation of the patient.Physicians would then realize, perhaps, how the\nuse of proprietary medicines stimulates the sale of nostrums.FAITH CURE AND GRAFT IN SURGERY.Suggestive Therapeutics Chief Stock in Trade--Advice of a Medical\n    College President--Disease Prevention

garden.I think we have enough before us to show why intelligent people become\nfollowers of fads.Seeing so many impositions and frauds, they forget all\nthe patient research and beneficent discoveries of noble men who have\ndevoted their lives to the work of giving humanity better health and\nlonger life.They are ready at once to denounce the whole medical system\nas a fraud, and become victims of the first \"new system\" or healing fad\nthat is plausibly presented to them.And here a question arises that is puzzling to many.If these systems are\nfads and frauds, why do they so rapidly get and retain so large a\nfollowing among intelligent people?The\nquacks of these fad schools get their cures, as every intelligent doctor\nof the old schools knows, in the same way and upon the same principle that\nis so important a factor in medical practice, _i.e._, _faith cure_--the\npsychic effect of the thing done, whether it be the giving of a dose of\nmedicine, a Christian Science pow-wow, the laying on of hands, the\n\"removal of a lesion\" by an Osteopath, the \"adjustment\" of the spine by a\nChiropractor, or what not.The principles of mind or faith cure are legitimately used by the honest\nphysician.Suggestive therapeutics is being systematically studied by many\nwho want to use it with honesty and intelligence.They realize fully that\nabuse of this principle figures largely in the maintenance of the shysters\nin their own school, and it is the very foundation of all new schools and\nhealing fads.The people must be made to know this, or fads will continue\nto flourish.The honest physician would be glad to have the people know more than this.He would be glad to have them know enough about symptoms of diseases to\nhave some idea when they really need the help of a physician.For he knows\nthat if the people knew this much all quacks would be speedily put out of\nbusiness.I wonder how many doctors know that observing people are beginning to\nsuspect that many physicians regulate the number of calls they make on a\npatient by motives other than the condition of the patient--size of\npocketbook and the condition of the roads, for instance.I am aware that\nsuch imputation is an insult to any physician worthy of the name, but the\nsad fact is that there are so many, when we count the quacks of all\nschools, unworthy of the name.Louis medical college once said to a large\ngraduating class: \"Young men, don't go to your work with timidity and\ndoubts of your ability to succeed.Look and act your part as physicians,\nand when you have doubts concerning your power over disease _remember\nthis_, ninety-five out of every hundred people who send for you would get\nwell just the same if they never took a drop of your medicine.\"I have\nnever mentioned this to a doctor who did not admit that it is perhaps\ntrue.If so, is there not enough in it alone to explain the apparent\nsuccess of quacks?Again I say there are many noble and brainy physicians, and these have\nmade practically all the great discoveries, invented all the useful\nappliances, written all the great books for other schools to study, and\nthey should have credit from the people for all this, and not be\nmisrepresented by little pretenders.Their teachings should be applied as\nthey gave them.The best of them to-day would have the people taught that\na physician's greatest work may be done in preventing rather than in\ncuring disease.Physicians of the Osler type would like to have the people\nunderstand how little potency drugs have to cure many dangerous diseases\nwhen they have a firm hold on the system.They would have some of the\nresponsibility removed from the shoulders of the physician by having the\npeople understand how much they may do by hygienic living and common-sense\nuse of natural remedies.But the conscientious doctor too often has to compete with the pretender\nwho wants the people to believe that _he_ is their hope and their\nsalvation, and in him they must trust.He wants them to believe that he\nhas a specific remedy for every disease that will go \"right to the spot\"\nand have the desired effect.People who believe this, and believe that\nwithout doctoring the patient could never get well, will sometimes try, or\nsee their neighbors try, a doctor of a \"new school.\"When they see about\nthe same proportion of sick recover, they conclude, of course, that the\ndoctor of the \"new school\" cured them, and is worthy to be forever after\nintrusted with every case of disease that may arise in their families.This is often brought about by the shyster M.D.overreaching himself by\ndiagnosing some simple affection as something very dangerous, in order to\nhave the greater credit in curing it.But he at times overestimates the\nconfidence of the family in his ability.They are ready to believe that\nthe patient's condition is critical, and in terror, wanting the help of\neverything that promises help, call in a doctor of some \"new school\"\nbecause neighbors told how he performed wonderful cures in their families.When the patient recovers speedily, as he would have done with no\ntreatment of any kind, and just as the shyster M.D.thought he would, the\nglory and credit of curing a \"bad case\" of a \"dangerous disease\" go to the\nnew system instead of redounding to the glory of Dr.Shyster, as he\nplanned it would.Is it any wonder true physicians sometimes get disgusted with their\nprofession when they see a shyster come into the town where they have\nworked for years, patiently and conscientiously building up a legitimate\npractice that begins to promise a decent living, and by such quack methods\nas diagnosing cases of simple fever, such as might come from acute\nindigestion or too much play in children, as something dangerous, typhoid\nor \"threatened typhoid,\" or cases of congestion of the lungs as \"lung\nfever,\" and by \"aborting\" or \"curing\" these terrible diseases in short\norder and having his patients out in a few days, jumps into fame and\n(financial) success at a bound?Because the typhoid (real typhoid)\npatients of the honest doctor lingered for weeks and sometimes died, and\nbecause frequently he lost a case of real pneumonia, he made but a poor\nshowing in comparison with the new doctor.\"He's just fresh from school,\nyou know, from a post-graduate course in the East.\"Or, \"He's been to the\nold country and _knows_ something.\"Just as if any physician, though he\nmay have been out of school for many years, does not, or may not, know of\nall the curative agencies of demonstrated merit!Would a medical journal fail to keep its readers posted concerning any new\ndiscovery in medicine, or helpful appliance that promises real good to the\nprofession?Yet people speak of one doctor's superior knowledge of the\nbest treatment of a particular disease as if that doctor had access to\nsome mysterious source of therapeutic knowledge unknown to other\nphysicians.It is becoming less easy to work the \"dangerous diagnosis\"\ngraft than formerly, for many people are learning that certain diseases\nmust \"run their course,\" and that there are no medicines that have\nspecific curative effects on them.There is another graft now that is taking the place of the one just\nmentioned, to some extent at least.In the hands of a fellow with lots of\nnerve and little conscience it is the greatest of them all.This is the\ngraft of the smart young fellow direct from a post-graduate course in the\nclinics of some great surgeon.He comes to town with a great flourish of trumpets.Of course, he observes\nthe ethics of the profession!The long accounts of his superior education\nand unusual experience with operative surgery are only legitimate items of\nnews for the local papers.It is only right that such an\nunusual doctor should have so much attention.There is no \"starving time\" for him.No weary wait of years for patients\nto come.At one bound he leaps into fame and fortune by performing \"big\noperations\" right and left, when before his coming such cases were only\noccasionally found, and then taken to surgeons of known ability and\nexperience.The reputable physician respects surgery, and would respect\nthe bright young fellow fresh from contact with the latest approved\nmethods who has nerve to undertake the responsibility of a dangerous\noperation when such an operation is really indicated.But when it comes to\nmutilating the human body by cutting away an appendix or an ovary because\nit is known that to remove them when neither they nor the victim are much\ndiseased is a comparatively safe and very _quick_ way to get a big\nreputation--that is the limit of quackery.And no wonder such a man is so\ncordially hated by his brethren.He not always hated because he mutilates\nhumanity so much, as because his spectacular graft in surgery is sure to\nbe taken as proof conclusive that he is superior in all other departments\nof therapeutics.And it puzzles observing laymen sometimes to know why all the successful\n(?)operations are considered such desirable items of news, while the\ncases that are not flattering in their outcome pass unmentioned.I find most complete corroboration of my contention in the president's\naddress, delivered before the Western Surgical and Gynecological\nAssociation at St.Louis, in 1907, by Charles W. Oviatt, M.D.This address\nwas published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, and I\nherewith reprint it in part:\n\n    \"The ambitious medical student does not usually get far into college\n    work before he aspires to become a surgeon.He sees in the surgical\n    clinics more definite and striking results than are discernible in\n    other branches.Without being able to judge of his own relative\n    fitness or whether he possesses the special aptitude so essential to\n    success, he decides to become a surgeon.There will always be room for\n    the young surgeon who, fitted by nature for the work, takes the time\n    and opportunity to properly prepare himself.There is more good\n    surgery being done to-day than ever before, and there are more good\n    surgeons being educated to do the work.If, however, the surgeon of\n    the future is to hold the high and honorable position our leaders have\n    held in the past, there must be some standard of qualification\n    established that shall protect the people against incompetency and\n    dishonesty in surgeons.\"That there is much that passes under the name of surgery being done\n    by ill-trained, incompetent men, will not be denied.What standard,\n    then, should be established, and what requirement should be made\n    before one should be permitted to do surgery?In his address as\n    chairman of the Section on Surgery and Anatomy of the American Medical\n    Association, at the Portland (1905) meeting, Dr.Maurice H. Richardson\n    deals with this subject in such a forceful, clear-cut way, that I take\n    the liberty to quote him at some length:\n\n        \"'The burden of the following remarks is that those only should\n        practice surgery who by education in the laboratory, in the\n        dissecting-room, by the bedside, and at the operating-table, are\n        qualified, first, to make reasonably correct deductions from\n        subjective and objective signs; secondly, to give sound advice for\n        or against operations; thirdly, to perform operations skillfully\n        and quickly, and, fourthly, to conduct wisely the after-treatment.\"'The task before me is a serious criticism of what is going on in\n        every community.I do not single out any community or any man.There is in my mind no doubt whatever that surgery is being\n        practiced by those who are incompetent to practice it--by those\n        whose education is imperfect, who lack natural aptitude, whose\n        environment is such that they never can gain that personal\n        experience which alone will really fit them for what surgery means\n        to-day.They are unable to make correct deductions from histories;\n        to predict probable events; to perform operations skillfully, or\n        to manage after-treatment.\"'All surgeons are liable to error, not only in diagnosis, but in\n        the performance of operations based on diagnosis.Such errors must\n        always be expected and included in the contingencies of the\n        practice of medicine and surgery.Doubtless many of my hearers can\n        recall cases of their own in which useless--or worse than\n        useless--operations have been performed.If, however, serious\n        operations are in the hands of men of large experience, such\n        errors will be reduced to a minimum.\"'Many physicians send patients for diagnosis and opinion as to\n        the advisability of operation without telling the consultant that\n        they themselves are to perform the operation.The diagnosis is\n        made and the operation perhaps recommended, when it appears that\n        the operation is to be in incompetent hands.His advice should be\n        conditional that it be carried out only by the competent.Many\n        operations, like the removal of the vermiform appendix in the\n        period of health, the removal of fibroids which are not seriously\n        offending, the removal of gall-stones that are not causing\n        symptoms, are operations of choice rather than of necessity; they\n        are operations which should never be advised unless they are to be\n        performed by men of the greatest skill.Furthermore, many\n        emergency operations, such as the removal of an inflamed appendix\n        and other operations for lesions which are not necessarily\n        fatal--should be forbidden and the patient left to the chances of\n        spontaneous recovery, if the operation proposed is to be performed\n        by an incompetent.\"'And is not the surgeon, appreciating his own unfitness in spite\n        of years of devotion, in the position to condemn those who lightly\n        take up such burdens without preparation and too often without\n        conscience?\"'In view of these facts, who should perform surgery?How shall\n        the surgeon be best fitted for these grave duties?As a matter of\n        right and wrong, who shall, in the opinion of the medical\n        profession, advise and perform these responsible acts and who\n        shall not?Surgical operations should be performed only by those\n        who are educated for that special purpose.\"'I have no hesitation in saying that the proper fitting of a man\n        for surgical practice requires a much longer experience as a\n        student and assistant than the most exacting schools demand.A man\n        should serve four, five or six years as assistant to an active\n        surgeon.During this period of preparation, as it were, as much\n        time as possible should be given to observing the work of the\n        masters of surgery throughout the world.'Richardson's ideal may seem almost utopian, there being so\n    wide a difference between the standard he would erect and the one\n    generally established, we must all agree that however impossible of\n    attainment under present conditions, such an ideal is none too high\n    and its future realization not too much to hope for.\"While there is being done enough poor surgery that is honest and well\n    intended, there is much being done that is useless, conscienceless,\n    and done for purely commercial ends.This is truly a disagree", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "\"The spirit of graft that has pervaded our ranks, especially here in\n    the West, is doing much to lower the standard and undermine the morals\n    and ethics of the profession.When fee-splitting and the paying of\n    commissions for surgical work began to be heard of something like a\n    decade ago, it seemed so palpably dishonest and wrong that it was\n    believed that it would soon die out, or be at least confined to the\n    few in whom the inherited commercial instinct was so strong that they\n    could not get away from it.But it did not die; on the other hand, it\n    has grown and flourished.\"In looking for an explanation for the existence of this evil, I think\n    several factors must be taken into account, among them being certain\n    changes in our social and economic conditions.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.This is an age of\n    commercialism.We are known to the world as a nation of \"dollar\n    chasers,\" where nearly everything that should contribute to right\n    living is sacrificed to the Moloch of money.The mad rush for wealth\n    which has characterized the business world, has in a way induced some\n    medical men, whether rightfully or wrongfully, to adopt the same\n    measures in self-protection.The patient or his friends too often\n    insist on measuring the value of our services with a commercial\n    yard-stick, the fee to be paid being the chief consideration.In this\n    way the public must come in for its share of responsibility for\n    existing conditions.So long as there are people who care so little\n    who operates on them, just so long will there be cheap surgeons, cheap\n    in every respect, to supply the demand.The demand for better\n    physicians and surgeons must come in part from those who employ their\n    services.\"Another source of the graft evil is the existence of low-grade,\n    irregular and stock-company medical schools.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.In many of these schools\n    the entrance requirements are not in evidence outside of their\n    catalogues.With no standard of character or ethics, these schools\n    turn out men who have gotten the little learning they possess in the\n    very atmosphere of graft.The existence of these schools seems less\n    excusable when we consider that our leading medical colleges rank with\n    the best in the world and are ample for the needs of all who should\n    enter the profession.Their constant aim is to still further elevate\n    the standard and to admit as students only those who give unmistakable\n    evidence of being morally and intellectually fit to become members of\n    the profession.\"Enough men of character, however, are entering the field through\n    these better schools to ensure the upholding of those lofty ideals\n    that have characterized the profession in the past and which are\n    essential to our continued progress.I think, therefore, that we may\n    take a hopeful view of the future.The demand for better prepared\n    physicians will eventually close many avenues that are now open to\n    students, greatly to the benefit of all.With the curtailing of the\n    number of students and a less fierce competition which this will\n    bring, there will be less temptation, less necessity, if you will, on\n    the part of general practitioners to ask for a division of fees.He\n    will come to see that honest dealing on his part with the patient\n    requiring special skill will in the long run be the best policy.He\n    will make a just, open charge for the services he has rendered and not\n    attempt to collect a surreptitious fee through a dishonest surgeon for\n    services he has not rendered and could not render.Then, too, there\n    will be less inducement and less opportunity for incompetent and\n    conscienceless men to disgrace the art of surgery.\"The public mind is becoming especially active just at this time in\n    combating graft in all forms, and is ready to aid in its destruction.The intelligent portion of the laity is becoming alive to the patent\n    medicine evil.It is only a question of time when the people will\n    demand that the secular papers which go into our homes shall not\n    contain the vile, disgusting and suggestive quack advertisements that\n    are found to-day.A campaign of reform is being instituted against\n    dishonest politicians, financiers, railroad and insurance magnates,\n    showing that their methods will be no longer tolerated.The moral\n    standards set for professional men and men in public life are going to\n    be higher in the future, and with the limelight of public opinion\n    turned on the medical and surgical grafter, the evil will cease to\n    exist.Hand in hand with this reform let us hope that there will come\n    to be established a legal and moral standard of qualification for\n    those who assume to do surgery.\"I feel sure that it is the wish of every member of this association\n    to do everything possible to hasten the coming of this day and to aid\n    in the uplifting of the art of surgery.Our individual effort in this\n    direction must lie largely through the influence we exert over those\n    who seek our advice before beginning the study of medicine, and over\n    those who, having entered the work, are to follow in our immediate\n    footsteps.To the young man who seeks our counsel as to the\n    advisability of commencing the study of medicine, it is our duty to\n    make a plain statement of what would be expected of him, of the cost\n    in time and money, and an estimate of what he might reasonably expect\n    as a reward for a life devoted to ceaseless study, toil and\n    responsibility.If, from our knowledge of the character, attainments\n    and qualifications of the young man we feel that at best he could make\n    but a modicum of success in the work, we should endeavor to divert his\n    ambition into some other channel.\"We should advise the 'expectant surgeon' in his preparation to follow\n    as nearly as possible the line of study suggested by Richardson.Then\n    I would add the advice of Senn, viz: 'To do general practice for\n    several years, return to laboratory work and surgical anatomy, attend\n    the clinics of different operators, and never cease to be a physician.If this advice is followed there will be less unnecessary operating\n    done in the future than has been the case in the past.'The young man\n    who enters special work without having had experience as a general\n    practitioner, is seriously handicapped.In this age, when we have so\n    frequently to deal with the so-called border-line cases, it is\n    especially well never to cease being a physician.\"We would next have the young man assure himself that he is the\n    possessor of a well-developed, healthy, working'surgical conscience.'No matter how well qualified he may be, his enthusiasm in the earlier\n    years of his work will lead him to do operations that he would refrain\n    from in later life.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.He knows that early and thorough radical measures alone hold out hope,\n    and only by repeated unsuccessful efforts will he learn to temper his\n    ambition by the judgment that comes of experience.Pirogoff, the noted\n    surgeon, suffered from a malignant growth.Billroth refused to operate\n    or advise operation.In writing to another surgeon friend he said: 'I\n    am not the bold operator whom you knew years ago in Zurich.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Before\n    deciding on the necessity of an operation, I always propose to myself\n    this question: Would you permit such an operation as you intend\n    performing on your patient to be done on yourself?Years and\n    experience bring in their train a certain degree of hesitancy.'This,\n    coming from one who in his day was the most brilliant operator in the\n    world, should be remembered by every surgeon, young and old.\"In the hands of the skilled,\nconscientious surgeon how great are thy powers for good to suffering\nhumanity!In the hands of shysters \"what crimes are committed in thy\nname!\"With his own school full of shysters and incompetents, and grafters of\n\"new schools\" and \"systems\" to compete with on every hand, the\nconscientious physician seems to be \"between the devil and the deep sea!\"With quacks to the right of him, quacks to the left of him, quacks in\nfront of him, all volleying and thundering with their literature to prove\nthat the old schools, and all schools other than theirs, are frauds,\nimpostors and poisoners, about all that is left for the layman to do when\nsick is to take to the woods.PART TWO\n\nOSTEOPATHY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.Romantic Story of Osteopathy's Origin--An Asthma Cure--Headache Cured\n    by Plowlines--Log Rolling to Relieve Dysentery--Osteopathy is Drugless\n    Healing--Osteopathy is Manual Treatment--Liberty of Blood, Nerves and\n    Arteries--Perfect Skeletal Alignment and Tonic, Ligamentous, Muscular\n    and Facial Relaxation--Andrew T. Still in 1874--Kirksville, Mo., as a\n    Mecca--American School of Osteopathy--The Promised Golden Stream of\n    Prosperity--Shams and Pretenses--The \"Mossbacks\"--\"Who's Who in\n    Osteopathy.\"The story of the origin of Osteopathy is romantic enough to appeal to the\nfancy of impressionists.It is almost as romantic as the finding of the\nmysterious stones by the immortal Joe Smith.In this story is embodied the\nlife history of an old-time doctor and pioneer hero in his restless\nmigrations about the frontiers of Kansas and Missouri.His thrilling\nexperiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are\nnarrated, and how the germ of the idea of the true cause and cure of\ndisease was planted in his mind by the remark of a comrade as the two lay\nconcealed in a thicket for days to escape border ruffians.Then, later,\nhow the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom\nall his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had\nbeen powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that\ndrugs could cure disease.He believed Nature had a true system, and for\nthis he began a patient search.He wandered here and there, almost in the\ncondition of the religious reformers of old, who \"wandered up and down\nclad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy.\"In\nthe name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he\nmight read from his red bones some clue to the secret.One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to\nthe discovery of the \"great truth.\"It states that by accidentally curing\na case of asthma by \"fooling with the bones of the chest,\" he was led to\nthe belief that bones out of normal position cause disease.Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing\nof late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics.In this\nmagazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by\ncuring a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing\nmade of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a\nlog to relieve the pain of dysentery.Accidentally the \"lesion\" was\ncorrected, or the proper center \"inhibited,\" and his headache and flux\nimmediately cured.You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful\ndiscovery.Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to\ninquire \"What is it?\"its leading promoters have vied with each other in\ntrying to construct a good definition for their \"great new science.\"Here are some of the definitions:\n\n\"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing.\"For a genuine \"lesion\"\nOsteopath that would not do at all.It is too broad and gives too much\nscope to the physicians who would do more than \"pull bones.\"\"Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and\nscientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease.\"That definition\nsuits better, because of the \"manual treatment.\"If you are a true\nOsteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any\nmechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression\nthat you are \"handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who\nknows every part of his machine.\"\"The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that\nit may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,\nnerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination.\"This\ndefinition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we\nwonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same\neffect.\"Liberty of blood\" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must\nadmit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or\nhot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate\ncirculation, is rational.But when \"liberty of blood\" is mentioned, what\nis meant by \"liberty of arteries\"?\"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic\nligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation.\"Some Osteopaths and other\ntherapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used\n\"big words\" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of\nthe one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,\ntechnical terms and \"high-sounding nothings\" used by so many Osteopathic\nwriters.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,\nPh.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general\npublic in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify\ngreat truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If\nwriters for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying\nand popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on\nOsteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary\nis taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and\nmotives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading\npromoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be\nwithheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in\nKansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He\nwas at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.During the Civil War\nhe was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the\nwar that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something\nnatural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by\nhis profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the\ndiscovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of\nKirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had\nimplicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious\nmovements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn\ntoward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's\nhealing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,\nwhich from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and\nequipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated\nyearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been\nfounded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number\nof schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the\ncountry.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and\nthis number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians\nthan are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic\nreports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable\nlegal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I\nshall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and\nwomen who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater\nimportance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide\nwhich system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their\nlives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one\ninjustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the\ncause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents\nthe sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of\ntelling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this \"new science\" of\nhealing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes\nbold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of\npractitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy\nfor disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of\nOsteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that\nsince the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are\nso blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the\npractice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic\ncollege that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim\nmyself as an exponent of a \"complete and well-rounded system of healing,\nadequate for every emergency,\" as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the\njournals published for \"Osteopathic physicians\" to scatter broadcast among\nthe people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an\nOsteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility\nfor human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the\ncase as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy\nwould cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been\ncalled a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not\npractice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and \"subluxated,\" and tell\npeople that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five\ndollars per month, to have one or two \"subluxations\" corrected.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.In\nconsequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the\nliterature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to\nall \"Osteopathic physicians\" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies\nof Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with\nsome of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor\nof an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This\neditor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in\nwhich he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,\nas I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as\nhe acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I\nbelieve, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been\ndiscouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am\nwriting.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I\nbelieve, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large\nnumber of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all\nthat makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say\nthat they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing\nnumber.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of\nthe small per cent.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.It may not be\nknown how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in\nthe meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a\nstore, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic\nphysicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no\nreason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who\nhave quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,\nstarted out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was\npointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath\nfrom the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance\nbill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a\nchain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,\nabout eight hundred of them, of \"mossbacks,\" as we were politely called.I\nsay \"we,\" for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the\nnames of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could\nbe had with them.Just for what, aside\nfrom the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not\nclear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,\nand do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals\nare continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the\n\"Who's Who in Osteopathy\" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is\nnot strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic\njournals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those\nwho choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students\nshould know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational\n    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in Exact Proportion to Advertising\n    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous\n    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine\n    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic\n    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of\n    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The\n    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as \"Professor\"--The Lure of\n    \"Honored Doctor\" with \"Big Income\"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in\npopularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them\nintelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to\nfollow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and\npopularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing\nsystem.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people\nare so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The \"perfect\nadjustment,\" \"perfect functioning\" theory of Osteopathy is especially\nattractive to people made ripe for some \"drugless healing\" system by\ncauses already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of\nall manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative\npowers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such\ngood results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will\nestablish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and\nholds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,\ntaught as \"a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,\"\nhas grown and spread largely as a \"patent medicine\" flourishes, _i.e._,\nin exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not\npresume to make this statement as merely my opinion.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.The question at issue\nis too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present\nfacts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.Every week I get booklets or \"sample copies\" of journals heralding the\nwonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as\njournals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by\nthe hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution\nby these patients to their friends.The publishers of these \"boosters\"\nsay, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their\npractice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of\nthese journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:\n\n    \"Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me\n    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite\n    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their\n    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter\nopposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it\nbecause \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\"At one time I honestly\nbelieved this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic\nauthority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract\nfrom a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic\nAssociation:\n\n    \"Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at\n    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of\n    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our\n    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which\n    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe\n    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its\n    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized\n    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._\n    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your\n    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your\n    own limitations_?\"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we\nhave boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: \"Curbing our\nlimitations\" and \"sounding your own limitations.\"But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body \"_our\ndeath knell begins to sound_,\" indicate that Osteopathic leaders are\ncontent to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science\ndepends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he\nsaid, \"Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of\nOsteopathy as an independent system\"?If truth always grows under\npersecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when\nit is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where\nthey have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of\ninvalids every day.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic\njournals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends\nupon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was\ndemonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the\nbenefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its\nmerits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly\na _name_, and \"lives, moves, and has its being\" in boosting?It seems to\nhave been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have\npublished again and again the nice things a number of governors said when\nthey signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State\nauthority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a\nchampion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.Mark Twain once went\nup to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to\nresist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed\nMark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned\nhistory of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a\nchampion of the \"under dog in the fight.\"Lately he has gone on the\nwarpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond\ndelusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll\nSouthern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and\nboldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have\ntossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to\nbe promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his \"Heart's Desire.\"There may have been \"method in his madness,\" for that Osteopathic horse\ndoctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam\nsaid, \"There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as\nbetween playing a piano and currying a horse.\"The idea of comparing the\nOsteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the\npianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that\npreachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors\nwhen they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.[Illustration]\n\nOf the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond\nthe description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated\nin the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete\nunderstanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further\nthe proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady's\npart.The gentleman's is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._\n\n\nTHE LONG BOSTON\n\nThe ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is\ncommonly known as the \"Long\" Boston to distinguish it from other forms\nand variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and\nat any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it\nshould be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE SHORT BOSTON\n\nThe \"Short\" Boston differs from the \"Long\" Boston only in measure.It is\ndanced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)\noccupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements\neach occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between\nthe \"Long\" and the \"Short\" Boston the same difference as between the\nWaltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the \"Short\" Boston, the\nrising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take\nthe form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less\nfatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON\n\nThe \"Open\" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first\npart is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages\n8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the \"Long\"\nBoston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,\nwithout turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to\nface directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the\nposition shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one\nBoston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz\nPosition for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE BOSTON DIP\n\nThe \"Dip\" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4\nmeasures of the \"Long\" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:\n\nStanding upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the\nweight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in\nfront of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);\nlower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original\nplace where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across\nin front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the\nleft heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side\nof the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across\nin front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down\nthe left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it\n(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and\nfinish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives\nthe weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the\nmovement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly\ncoincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TURKEY TROT\n\n_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._\n\n\nDuring the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning\n(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,\nstretch the free foot backward, (lady's left, gentleman's right) as\nshown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady's right, gentleman's left)\nswaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and\npointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *\n\n  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in \"The Gobbler\" by\n  J. Monroe", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "THE AEROPLANE GLIDE\n\n\nThe \"Aeroplane Glide\" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed\nto represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its\nname from that fact.The sole difference between the \"Dip\" and \"Aeroplane\" consists in the\nsix running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running\nsteps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before\nand behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure\nrequires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is\nnoticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the \"Dip\".[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TANGO\n\n\nThe Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the\npeculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends\nlargely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the\nmusic as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,\nand the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend\nthemselves most readily to verbal description.1\n\nThe partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes\nthe lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full\nextent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand\nupon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration\nopposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and\nsteps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows\nforward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing\none foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same\ndirection.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the\nwhole is repeated at will.2\n\nThis variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman\ntakes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two\nsteps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two\nsteps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as\nthe feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the\nwhole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE \"BOSTON\"\n\n\nPIANO SOLO\n\n(_Also to be had for Full or Small Orchestra_)\n\nLOVE'S AWAKENING           _J.Danglas_       .60\nON THE WINGS OF DREAM      _J.Danglas_       .60\nFRISSON (Thrill!)Sinibaldi_     .50\nLOVE'S TRIUMPH             _A.Daniele_       .60\nDOUCEMENT                  _G.Robert_        .60\nVIENNOISE                  _A.Duval_         .60\n\nThese selected numbers have attained success, not alone for their\nattractions of melody and rich harmony, but for their rhythmical\nflexibility and perfect adaptedness to the \"Boston.\"FOR THE TURKEY TROT\n\nEspecially recommended\n\nTHE GOBBLER                _J.Monroe_        .50\n\n\nAny of the foregoing compositions will be supplied on receipt of\none-half the list price.PUBLISHED BY\n\nTHE BOSTON MUSIC COMPANY 26 & 28 WEST ST., BOSTON, MASS.TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\n\n\n  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.The disease\npasses through four different stages or periods; but for present purposes\nit will be sufficient to merely mention the most prominent of the\nsuccessive changes and appearances, as they occur to the ordinary\nobserver.The incubatory stage, or the time between contamination and the\ndevelopment of the disease, is very short (from twenty-four hours to one\nor two weeks), and the disease is ushered in by the general symptoms of\nfever, such as shivering, increased temperature, staring coat, dry muzzle,\ndullness and loss of appetite.The animals seek seclusion, preferably in\nsheltered places, where they assume a crouched position, or lie down, and\nthere is more or less stiffness and unwillingness to move.The mouth\nbecomes hot and inflamed looking, and covered with slime, the breath\nfetid; the animal grinds the teeth, smacks with mouth, and has difficulty\nin swallowing.There is more or less tenderness of feet and lameness, and\nin cows the udder becomes red and tender, the teats swollen, and they\nrefuse to be milked.Depending upon the intensity of the fever and the\nextent to which the udder is affected, the milk secretion will be more or\nless diminished, or entirely suspended; but throughout the disease the\nquality or constituents of the milk become materially altered; its color\nchanges to a yellow; it has a tendency to rapid decomposition, and\npossesses virulent properties.Soon yellowish-white blisters, of various\nsizes, from that of a small pea to a small hickory nut, appear on the\nmucous surface within the mouth, and which blisters often in the course of\ndevelopment become confluent or coalesce.They generally break within two\nto three days, and leave bright red, uneven, and ragged sores or ulcers,\nto the edges of which adheres shreds of detached epithelial tissue.The\nanimal now constantly moves the tongue and smacks the mouth, while more or\nless copious and viscid saliva continually dribbles from the mouth.The\nlameness increases in proportion as the feet are affected, and if the fore\nfeet are most affected, the animal walks much like a floundered horse,\nwith the hinder limbs advanced far under the body, and with arched back.The coronet of the claws, especially toward the heels, becomes swollen,\nhot, and tender, causing the animal to lie down most of the time.The\nblisters, which appear at the interdigital space of the claws, and\nespecially at the heels, break in the course of a day and discharge a\nthick, straw- fluid; the ulcers, which are of intensely red or\nscarlet color, soon become covered with exudating lymph, which dries and\nforms scabs.On the udder, the blisters appear more or less scattered and\nvariable, and they are most numerous at the base and on the teats.Ordinarily, the disease terminates in two or three weeks, while the\nanimal, which during its progress refuses to partake of any other than\nsloppy food, gradually regains strength and flesh, and the udder resumes\nits normal functions.The mortality at times has proved very great in this\ndisease when it has appeared with unusual virulency.In common \"horse language,\" these propensities are confounded one with the\nother or else no proper and right distinction is made between them.A\nhorse may be timid without being shy, though he can hardly be said to be\nshy without being timid.Young horses in their breaking are timid,\nfrightened at every fresh or strange object they see.They stand gazing\nand staring at objects they have not seen before, fearful to approach\nthem; but they do not run away from, or shy at them; on the contrary, the\nmoment they are convinced there is nothing hurtful in them, they refuse\nnot to approach or even trample upon them.He can not be persuaded to turn toward or even to look at the object he\nshies at; much less to approach it.Timid horses, through usage and experience, get the better of their\ntimidity, and in time become very opposite to fearful; but shy horses,\nunless worked down to fatigue and broken-spiritedness, rarely forget their\nold sins.The best way to treat them is to work them, day by day,\nmoderately for hours together, taking no notice whatever of their shying\ntricks, neither caressing nor chastising them, and on no account whatever\nendeavoring to turn their heads either towards or away from the objects\nshied at.With a view of shedding light on the important question of the\ncontagiousness of glanders, we will mention the following deductions from\nfacts brought forth by our own experience.That farcy and glanders, which constitute the same disease, are\npropagable through the medium of stabling, and this we believe to be the\nmore usual way in which the disease is communicated from horse to horse.That infected stabling may harbor and retain the infection for months,\nor even years; and though, by thoroughly cleansing and making use of\ncertain disinfecting means, the contagion may probably be destroyed, it\nwould not perhaps be wise to occupy such stables _immediately_ after such\nsupposed or alleged disinfection.That virus (or poison of glanders) may lie for months in a state of\nincubation in the horse's constitution, before the disease breaks out.We\nhave had the most indubitable evidence of its lurking in one horse's\nsystem for the space of fifteen weeks.That when a stud or stable of horses becomes contaminated, the disease\noften makes fearful ravages among them before it quits them;

if so, as in epidemics, all the\npear trees may be poisoned or ergotized, but only the weakest succumb; and\nperhaps this debility may be confined to one limb.The practical value of\nthis view is manifest, as it is impracticable to avoid using the same\nknife, and remove every blighted leaf from the orchard.Moreover, if the\nlimb is a large one, its prompt removal shocks the vitality of the whole\ntree[1] and thus renders other parts more vulnerable.On the contrary\nview, the limb may be allowed to drop by natural process, precisely as all\ntrees in a forest shed their lower limbs, leaving hardly a cicatrice or\nscar, and this may be insured at any season by a cord of hemp twine,\nfirmly bound around the limb.The inevitable strangulation, and the\nhealing of the stump (without the mycelium of fungi which the knife or saw\ninevitably propagates by exposing a denuded surface, if not more directly)\nproceed more rapidly than the natural slough of limbs by starvation.Moreover the fruit may mature on such limbs during their strangulation, as\nthis may not be perfected before the subsequent winter.The next practical result of my view is the fundamental importance of all\nthose means which are calculated to husband the vital force of the tree\nduring its first effort to fruit; one of these is the use of a soil that\nwill not produce more than twenty bushels of corn without manure, thus a\nlarge proportion of the setts will be aborted, but one half of what\nremains should be removed, and subsequently the area beneath the limbs\nshould have a wheelbarrow of good compost.D. S.\n\n  Footnote 1: NOTE.--The shock as to vital force is\n     demonstrated by the fact that when young trees are not\n     trimmed at all their girth increases more rapidly, and they\n     bear fruit sooner.Moreover, when old trees are severely\n     pruned (though not half the proportion of wood is removed)\n     they fail to bear during the next year.I find that a hemp\n     cord about the size of the stem of a tobacco pipe\n     (one-fourth inch diameter) will soon become imbedded in the\n     bark if firmly tied around a limb, and perhaps this size is\n     more efficient than a thicker cord.The black walnut is without doubt the most valuable tree we have for the\nrich lands of the \"corn belt,\" West, and one which is very easily grown\neverywhere if the farmer will only learn how to get it started.How few we\nsee growing on our prairies.Simply because to have it we must grow\nit from the nuts.It is nearly impossible to transplant black walnut trees\nof any size and have them live; although it is a fact that whenever a\nnon-professional attempts to grow them from the nuts he is almost sure to\nfail, it is also a fact that there is no tree that is more easily grown\nfrom the seed than this, if we only know how to do it.It is my purpose in this note to tell how to do it, and also how not to do\nit.In the first instance we will suppose a man lives where he can gather the\nnuts in the woods.When the nuts begin to fall let him plow deeply the\nplot of ground he wishes to plant and furrow it off three or four inches\ndeep, the distance apart he wishes his rows to be.He will then go to the\nwoods and gather what nuts he wishes to plant, and plant them at once,\njust as they come from the tree, covering them just out of sight in the\nfurrows.This is all there is of it; simple, is it not?But it will not do\nto gather a great wagon box full, and let them stand in it until they\nheat, or to throw them in a great heap on the ground and let them lay\nthere until they heat.It will not do, either, to hull them and let them\nlay in the sun a week or two, or hull them, dry them and keep them until\nspring, and then plant; none of these plans will do if you want trees.Of\ncourse if the nuts are hulled and planted at once they will grow; but this\nhulling is entirely unnecessary.Besides, the hulls seem to act as a\nspecial manure for the young seedlings, causing them to grow more\nvigorously.Next, we will suppose one wishes to plant walnuts where they can not be\nhad from the woods, but must be shipped in.There seems to be only one\nplan by which this can be done safely every time, which is as follows:\nGather the nuts as they fall from the trees--of course when they begin to\nfall naturally all may be shaken down at once--and spread them not over a\nfoot deep, on the bare ground under the shade of trees.Cover out of sight\nwith straw or leaves, with some sticks to hold in place called a \"rot\nheap;\" then after they are frozen and will stay so, they may be shipped in\nbags, boxes, barrels, or in bulk by the car-load, and then, again, placed\nin \"rot heaps,\" as above, until so early in the spring as the soil is in\nworkable condition.Then plant as directed in the fall, except the soil\nshould be firmly packed around the nuts.Keep free from weeds by good\ncultivation, and in due time you will have a splendid grove.There was an immense crop of walnuts in this district last fall, and\nthousands of bushels were put up carefully, in this way, all ready for\nshipment before the weather became warm; many more thousands were planted\nto grow seedlings from, for, notwithstanding the walnut transplants poorly\nwhen of considerable size, the one year seedlings transplant with as\nlittle loss as the average trees.There is no tree better adapted for planting to secure timber claims with\nthan the black walnut, and none more valuable when the timber is grown.For this purpose the land should be plowed deeply, then harrowed to\nfineness and firmness, and furrowed out in rows four, six, eight, or ten\nfeet apart.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.It is best to plant\nthickly in the rows, then if too thick they can be thinned out,\ntransplanting the thinnings, or selling them to the neighbors.They should\nbe thoroughly cultivated, until large enough to shade the ground, and\nthinned out as necessary as they grow larger.A walnut grove thoroughly\ncultivated the first ten years will grow at least twenty feet high, while\none not cultivated at all would only grow two to three feet in that time.WIER., LACON, ILL.Why can not Illinois have an Arbor Day as well as Nebraska, or any other\nState.There ought to be ten millions of trees planted the coming spring\nwithin its borders--saying nothing of orchard trees--by the roadside, on\nlawns, for shade, for wind breaks, for shelter, for mechanical purposes,\nand for climatic amelioration.Nearly all our towns and villages need more\ntrees along the streets or in parks; thousands of our farms are suffering\nfor them; hundreds of cemeteries would be beautified by them, and\nnumberless homes would be rendered more pleasant and homelike by an\naddition of one, two, or a dozen, to their bleak places.Can not THE\nPRAIRIE FARMER start a boom that will lead to the establishment of an\nArbor Day all over the State?For the benefit of those who can not command the usual appliances for\nhot-beds, I will say that they can be made so as to answer a good purpose\nvery cheaply.Take a nice sunny spot that is covered with a sod, if to be\nhad.Dig off the sod in squares and pile them carefully on the north side\nand the ends of the pit, to form the sides of the bed, with a proper\n<DW72>.The soil thrown out from the bottom may be banked up against the\nsods as a protection.After the bed is finished, the whole may be covered\nwith boards, to turn the water off.These answer in the place of glass\nframes.As the main use for a hot-bed is to secure bottom heat, very good\nresults can be obtained in these cheaply constructed affairs.After the\nseeds are up, and when the weather will permit, the boards must be removed\nto give light and air--but replaced at night and before a rain.Of course,\nwhere large quantities of plants are to be grown, of tender as well as\nhardy sorts, it would be better and safer to go to the expense of board\nframes and glass for covering.Of course, all the peach trees, and many of the other stone fruits, and\nmost of the blackberry and raspberry plants, will show discoloration of\nwood when the spring opens--so much so that many will pronounce them\ndestroyed, and will proceed to cut them away.Peaches have\noften been thus injured, and by judicious handling saved to bear crops for\nyears afterward.But they will need to be thoroughly cut back.Trees of\nsix or seven years old I have cut down so as to divest them of nearly all\ntheir heads, when those heads seemed badly killed, and had them throw out\nnew heads, that made large growth and bore good crops the following\nseason.Cut them back judiciously, and feed them well, but don't destroy\nthem.Budd's articles on Russian Pears, can fail to be\ninterested and struck with the prospect of future successful pear culture\nin the United States.It is highly probable that Russia is yet to give us\na class of that fruit that will withstand the rigors of our climate.Individual enterprise can, and doubtless\nwill, accomplish much in that direction; but the object seems to me to be\nof sufficient importance to justify State or National action.The great\nState of Illinois might possibly add millions to her resources by giving\nmaterial aid in the furtherance of this purpose--and a liberal expenditure\nby the General Government, through the Department of Agriculture, or the\nAmerican Pomological Society, would be more usefully applied than many\nother large sums annually voted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.At all events, another season of fruitage\nought not to be allowed to pass without some concerted action for the\npurpose of testing the question.Some of our strongest nurserymen will likely be moving in the work, but\nthat will not be enough.The propagator of that fruit, however, who will\nsucceed in procuring from the European regions a variety of pears that\nwill fill the bill required by the necessities of our soil and climate,\nhas a fortune at his command.OLD WINTER\n\nlingers in the lap of spring, truly, this year of grace, 1884.Here it is\nthe 10th of March, and for over one hundred days we have had\nwinter--winter;

Y. For many years he endeavored to raise a currant\nthat would combine the size of the Cherry currant with the productiveness\nof the Victoria.To this end he fertilized one with the pollen of the\nother, and raised some thousands of seedlings, from out of which he\nselected this as the one that most nearly realized his desires.It is now\nsixteen years since this seedling was obtained.Fay tested this variety by the side of all the sorts in\ncultivation, until becoming convinced of its superiority in several\nparticulars over any of these, he planted it extensively for his own\nmarketing.At a late meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the currant\nworm came in for a good deal of talk.Satterthwaite said that\nhellebore, as we have often printed, was the most effectual \"remedy.\"He\nmixed it with water and applied it with a brush or whisk of straw.If not\nwashed off by rain for twenty-four hours and used every year, the worms\nwere easily got rid of.Saunders, Superintendent of the Government\nGardens at Washington, and a gentleman thoroughly conversant with every\nbranch of horticulture, said that there was nothing so effectual with\ninsects as London purple, and, though equally poisonous as Paris green,\nwas much cheaper.Tobacco stems and refuse have also been found of great\nvalue in fruit culture.Pyrethrum, he said, would also kill all sorts of\nleaf-eating insects; it is now largely cultivated in California, and is\nhardy at least as far north as Washington.JOSIAH HOOPES in New York Tribune: In Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey,\nwhere, literally, no pears have been grown of late years, the Kieffer is\ndoing well.I ate specimens last season\nfinely flavored and delicious; again when they were weak and watery.This\nfruit needs thinning on the trees and careful ripening in the house.Don't\nunderstand me to say that Kieffer is \"best of all.\"But here it is the\nmost profitable for market that I know of, as this is not a pear country,\nas are portions of New York State.As we go further south the Kieffer\nseems to improve, and I think Mr.Berckmans, of Georgia, will give it a\ngood name with him.Yes, the Kieffer will command a higher price in\nPhiladelphia than any other pear, and we think some people there know what\ngood fruit is.Don't imagine I have any axe on the grindstone in this\nmatter; pecuniarily the Kieffer is no more to me than the Bartlett or\ndozens of other varieties.[Illustration: FLORICULTURE]\n\nSome New Plants.ABUTILON THOMSONII PLENA.It is one of the peculiarities of plant culture, that after a certain\nnumber of years of cultivation, any plant having the properties of\nsporting freely, that is, changing greatly from the original wild\ncharacter of the plant, will become double.In most cases it first arises\nfrom seed, but with the plant under notice it appears that it was what is\ncalled a bud variation, that is, that from some freak of a particular\nbranch of a plant of the well-known A. Thomsonii, the ordinary single\nflowers were found to be double.This happening on a plant under the eye\nof a professional florist was taken off the plant and rooted, and at once\nbecame its established character.This phenomena of variation being\n\"fixed\" by separate propagation, is by no means rare, and not a few of our\nchoice fruits, flowers, and vegetables had their origin by the same means.It remains to be seen whether in this case it will be of much value except\nas a curiosity, it having precisely the same leaf markings as the\noriginal, which are a very distinct yellow mottling of the leaf in a field\nof green, and for which the plant is valuable alone, the flowers being\nquite of a secondary character.The flowers are said to be", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "This is the first year it has been sent out,\nand we shall not be surprised if it is soon followed by others, for\nusually, when the \"double\" condition of things has arrived no one has a\nmonopoly of the curiosity.ALTERNANTHERA AUREA NANA.This is a charming new plant of decided merit to the carpet style of\nbedding or edging, being very compact in growth, easily kept to a line of\nthe finest character, and producing what is of great importance in the\nsummer, a line of golden yellow.At times the old kind, A. aurea, would\ncome very good, but more often it had far too much of a green shade to\nfurnish the contrast sought after, and, as a result, failed to bring out\nthe effect the planter studied to produce.It is a fitting companion to A.\namabilis, A. paronychioides, and A. versicolor, and will be hailed with\ndelight by our park florists and other scientific planters.BOUVARDIA THOMAS MEEHAN.Here we have a double scarlet bouvardia from the same raisers, Nanz and\nNeuner, that astonished the floral world a few years back, with the double\nwhite B. Alfred Neuner.This new addition, unlike the old, which was\nanother \"bud variation,\" was secured by a cross between the old B.\nleiantha, scarlet with a single flower, and Alfred Neuner, double white.If this is the real origin of the kind, which we somewhat doubt, for if\nour theory is correct, that a certain amount of cultivation predisposes to\ndouble variation, then it is not necessary to cross the double, which in\nfact can not be done with a perfectly double flower--the organs of\nfructification being wanting with that of a single and seed-producing\nkind, to account for the origin of a new double.As is well known the old leiantha is one of the best scarlets yet, and\nthis new candidate for favor is said to unite the brilliant color and\nprofuse blooming qualities of the old favorite B. leiantha with the\nperfect double flowers of B. Alfred Neuner.There are now of this class of plants the three colors--white, scarlet,\nand pink--in double as well as single; for instance, a pink President\nGarfield sported from and was \"fixed\" from the white A.

yet\nthere have been times when it must be admitted that the combined power of\nthe 'Third House' has overridden the will of the people.The bad influence\nof the lobby can be seen in the numerous blood-bills that are introduced\nat every session.\"\"Easily enough, to the person who has made the thing a study.\"Tell me, to what bills do you refer?\"\"Well, take the annual gas bills, for instance.They are introduced for\nthe purpose of bleeding the Washington Gas Light company.They usually\nresult in an investigating committee which never amounts to anything more\nthan a draft upon the public treasury for the expenses of the\ninvestigation.Another squeeze is the _abattoir_ bills, as they are\ncalled.These, of course, are fought by the butchers and market-men.The\nfirst attempt to force a bill of this description was in 1877, when a\nprominent Washington politician offered a fabulous sum for the franchise.\"\"Anything else in this line that you think of, Mr.\"Yes, there's the job to reclaim the Potomac flats, which, had it become a\nlaw, would have resulted in an enormous steal.The work is now being done\nby the Government itself, and will rid the place of that malarial\natmosphere of which we hear so much outside the city.\"\"During your residence here have you experienced the bad results of living\nin this climate?\"\"Well, while I have not at all times enjoyed good health, I am certain\nthat the difficulty which laid me up so long was not malarial.It was\nsomething that had troubled me for years.A shooting, stinging pain that\nat times attacked different parts of my body.One day my right arm and leg\nwould torture me with pain, there would be great redness, heat and\nswelling of the parts; and perhaps the next day the left arm and leg would\nbe similarly affected.Then again it would locate in some particular part\nof my body and produce a tenderness which would well nigh drive me\nfrantic.There would be weeks at a time that I would be afflicted with an\nintermitting kind of pain that would come on every afternoon and leave me\ncomparatively free from suffering during the balance of the twenty-four\nhours.Then I would have terrible paroxysms of pain coming on at any time\nduring the day or night when I would be obliged to lie upon my back for\nhours and keep as motionless as possible.Every time I attempted to move a\nchilly sensation would pass over my body, or I would faint from hot\nflashes.I suffered from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles and a\nsoreness of the back and bowels, and even my eyeballs become sore and\ndistressed me greatly whenever I wiped my face.I became ill-tempered,\npeevish, fretful, irritable and desperately despondent.\"\"Of course you consulted the doctors regarding your difficulty?\"Some told me I had neuralgia;\nothers that I had inflammatory rheumatism, for which there was no cure,\nthat I would be afflicted all my life, and that time alone would mitigate\nmy sufferings.\"\"But didn't they try to relieve your miseries?\"\"Yes, they vomited and physicked me, blistered and bled me, plastered and\noiled me, sweat, steamed, and everything but froze me, but without avail.\"\"I had a friend living in Michigan who had been afflicted in a similar way\nand had been cured.He wrote me regarding his recovery and advised me to\ntry the remedy which cured him.I procured a bottle and commenced its use,\ntaking a teaspoonful after each meal and at bed-time.I had used it about\na week when I noticed a decrease of the soreness of the joints and a\ngeneral feeling of relief.I persevered in its use and finally got so I\ncould move around without limping, when I told my friends that it was\nWarner's Safe Rheumatic Cure that had put me on my feet.\"\"Certainly, I haven't been so well in years as I am now, and although I\nhave been subjected to frequent and severe changes of weather this winter,\nI have not felt the first intimation of the return of my rheumatic\ntrouble.\"\"Do you object to the publication of this interview, Mr.I look upon it as a duty I owe my fellow creatures to\nalleviate their sufferings so far as I am able, and any communication\nregarding my symptoms and cure that may be sent to me at 506 Maine avenue\nwill receive prompt and careful attention.\"\"Judging from your recital, Mr.Ashley, there must be wonderful curative\nproperties about this medicine?\"\"Indeed, there is, sir, for no man suffered more nor longer than did I\nbefore this remedy gave me relief.\"\"To go back to the original subject, Mr.Ashley, I suppose you see the\nsame familiar faces about the lobby session after session?\"\"No, not so much so as you might think.New faces are constantly seen and\nold ones disappear.The strain upon lobbyists is necessarily very great,\nand when you add to this the demoralizing effect of late hours and\nintemperate habits and the fact that they are after found out in their\nsteals, their disappearance can easily be accounted for.\"\"What proportion of these blood-bills are successful?\"Notwithstanding the power and influence of\nthe lobby, but few of these vicious measures pass.Were they successful it\nwould be a sad commentary upon our system of government, and would\nvirtually annihilate one branch of it.The great majority of them are\neither reported adversely or smothered in committee by the watchfulness\nand loyalty of our congressmen.\"J.

at all the other\npoints the increase has been considerable, amounting to a total of nearly\n800,000,000 feet.The largest cut is on the Mississippi river in what is\nknown as the West of Chicago District.Here in 1873 the product amounted\nto 650,000,000 feet; last year it reached 1,290,062,690 feet.The Saginaw\nValley gives the next greatest yield 961,781,164 feet.The total Saginaw\ndistrict gave last year 1,439,852,067 feet against 792,358,000 ten years\nago.The total of the West of Chicago District was 3,134,331,793 against\n1,353,000,000 in 1873.The Railroad and Interior Mills District has\nincreased something over 200,000,000 feet in this period.In shingles we have the grand product in all the Northwest of\n3,964,736,639 against 2,277,433,550 in 1873.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.The greatest increase was in\nthe Chicago District as given above, and here Ludington and Grand Haven\ncome in for an increase at the former place of over 33,000,000, and the\nlatter of more than 100,000,000.The total production of shingles in 1882\nwas larger than last year by about 130,000,000, but with that exception\nwas the largest ever known.The census of 1880 placed the annual lumber product of the United States\nat 18,000,000,000 feet.The Northwest then produced 5,651,295,000 feet or\nnearly one-third the entire product of the country.If this ratio has been\nuniform since we must now have a yield of over 20,000,000,000 feet.These\nare figures of enormous magnitude and of varied import.They mean\nemployment to an army of men, a large shipping interest, vast investments\nin mills and machinery, and vast incomes to owners of pine lands; they\nmean houses and barns and fences to a new and populous empire; they mean\nnumberless farms and millions of live stock.They also signify a rapid\ndestruction of our immense forests from the face of the earth, enormous\nprices for lumber to future generations, and possible floods to devastate\nour river bottoms, and drouths to scourge the highlands.They should\nimpress us all with the necessity and the profitableness of timber\nplanting on the unsettled and newly settled prairies and in thousands of\nplaces in all the older States.FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.Alarming reports from different parts of the country announcing the\npresence of foot-and-mouth disease have caused no inconsiderable\nexcitement among the people and in Government circles.First there came\nnews of an outbreak in Effingham county, Illinois, then in Louisa county,\nIowa, quickly followed by similar information from Adair county, Missouri.Paaren, dispatched to Effingham county by the Governor, reports the\ntrouble there not foot-and-mouth disease.There does exist a disease\nthere, however, similar to foot-rot in sheep, that is proving fatal to\nmany cattle.There have also been outbreaks of disease among cattle near\nDuquoin and Xenia, Illinois, which Dr.Paaren has been directed to\ninvestigate.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.No official reports as to the disease in Iowa and Missouri have been\nreceived, though Government Veterinary inspectors are now upon the ground\nmaking their investigations.It is said that several hundred head of\ncattle are affected in Missouri, though this is probably an exaggeration.There is no news regarding the disease in Maine.Reports from Kansas say the infected herds are strictly quarantined, and\nthat as yet no fresh outbreaks have occurred.It is proposed to annihilate\nthe five infected herds.Glick has convened the Legislature of Kansas in order that proper\nmeasures may be taken to protect the cattle interests of the State.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.A Des Moines dispatch dated the 15th, says letters from Louisa county to\nthe Governor in regard to the new cattle disease were read in the House,\nand on motion of Mr.Watrous that body adopted the substitute for the bill\nproviding for the appointment of a State veterinary surgeon.The\nsubstitute authorizes the veterinary surgeon to destroy all stock affected\nwith contagious disease.The bill is intended to enable the State to take\naction in the foot-and-mouth disease now affecting the stock.Discussion\nthen followed upon the substitute, which was taken up section by section,\nand it was for the most part adopted.The series of reported outbreaks mentioned has aroused Congress to the\nnecessity of action.The Senate on Monday passed a joint resolution\nappropriating $50,000 for the suppression of the disease in whatever State\nor Territory it appears.It is to be hoped that the Animal Industry bill will at once pass and\nbecome a law.The cattle dealers at the Chicago Union Stock Yards have\norganized a Live Stock Exchange, and the first action taken by it is to\nfight this bill in Congress.Emory A. Storrs, attorney for the heavy\nbrokers, is in Washington working might and main for its defeat.He finds\nit uphill work, evidently, for on Monday he sent a dispatch to Nelson\nMorris in these words: \"Send to-day a delegation of strong men; everything\nnow depends on backing; wire me at once protest; have seen several\nsenators this morning; advise me when delegation starts; have them stop at\nRiggs house.\"Acting under this advice the Exchange passed the following resolutions of\n\"unbelief.\"Whereas, It is the universal sentiment of the Chicago Live\n     Stock Exchange, at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, that\n     the bill now pending before Congress, known as the \"Animal\n     Industry bill,\" is dangerous in its design, not called for\n     by the condition of the live stock interest in this\n     country, and tends to place too much power in the\n     Department of Agriculture at Washington; therefore,\n\n     Resolved, That Elmer Washburn, Allan Gregory, F. D.\n     Bartlett, B. F. Harrison, and H. H. Conover, members of\n     this exchange, be, and hereby are, appointed a committee,\n     with instructions to proceed forthwith to Washington, and\n     present these resolutions to the proper authorities to\n     prevent the passage of said \"Animal Industry bill.\"Resolved, Further, that owing to the present excitement\n     throughout the United States over the false alarm of\n     pleuro-pneumonia and \"foot-and-mouth\" disease, that we, as\n     a body, should express our views fully upon this question.We do not believe there is such a disease as contagious\n     pleuro-pneumonia existing throughout the United States.We do not believe that such a disease as the\n     foot-and-mouth disease exists in either Illinois, Iowa, or\n     Kansas.That at no time within the space of twenty years have\n     the cattle, sheep, or hogs of this country been in as\n     healthy a condition as at the present time; for while we\n     are in favor of strict quarantine laws to prevent any\n     importation of disease into this country from abroad, we\n     believe if any disease should break out in this State, or\n     any other State, that the citizens would be interested\n     sufficiently to stamp it out without expense to the\n     National Government.Detmers appeared in the\nhall (accidentally of course!)and gave it as his opinion that not a\nsingle case of foot-and-mouth disease existed in America to-day.But the\nDoctor has so often put his foot in it in his mouthings about animal\ndiseases in the past that his beliefs or disbeliefs have little weight\nwith the public.The Doctor is evidently \"put out\" because he was not\ncalled upon to visit the infected districts, for he is reported as ending\nhis harangue by declaring he was tired of working for the Government, and\noffered his services to the Live Stock Exchange.Such, in brief, is a summary of the news of the week concerning the\nfoot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the States.As briefly stated in a previous issue of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, the Illinois\nState Board of Agriculture offers a premium of $100 for the best bushel of\ncorn (in ear) grown this year in the northern division of the State, and\n$50 for the second best bushel: and a like premium for the best and second\nbest bushel grown in the central and southern divisions.These divisions\ncorrespond with the three judicial divisions of the State.The following\nare the conditions:\n\nEach of the parties awarded the first premium to deliver twenty-five\nbushels, and each of the parties awarded the second premium to deliver\nfifteen bushels of corn in the ear in sacks to the State Board of\nAgriculture at Springfield, Ill.The corn delivered to be equal in quality\nto the samples awarded the respective premiums.The premiums to be paid\nwhen the premium bushels of corn and the amounts called for are compared\nat the rooms of the Department of Agriculture and favorably reported upon\nby the committee.Affidavit as to measurement of land and yield of corn are required.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.We suppose also that competitors are to furnish characteristics of soil,\nvariety of seed, kinds of manure used, mode of cultivation etc., as these\nfacts would seem to be necessary if the public is to receive the full\nbenefits of the experiments the premiums are likely to bring out.It is understood that the corn delivered to the State Board as per above\nconditions is to be in some judicious manner distributed to the\ncorn-growers of the State for planting in 1885.There recently began in Scotland an earnest movement to induce the British\nGovernment to remove the restrictions regarding the importation of\nAmerican cattle, so far at least as to allow the admission of store cattle\nfor feeding purposes.Meetings have been held in various parts of Scotland\nat", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "To the Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone.We, the undersigned, farmers and others, respectfully\n     submit that the present law which allows the importation of\n     cattle from the United States, and shuts out store cattle,\n     is unjust and oppressive to the farmers of this country,\n     and enhances the price of meat to the public.We therefore\n     crave that her Majesty's Government would open the Scottish\n     ports to the introduction of store cattle from the Western\n     States where disease does not exist.At a meeting at Montrose, where the above petition was favorably acted\nupon, Mr.Falconer, an Angus farmer, in supporting the motion, said that\nthe first great remedy for the present depression was to get cheap store\ncattle, and that would never be got until they opened their ports to the\nWestern States of America.He held that if farmers would agree to insist\non live store cattle being allowed to be landed in Britain, they would\nsoon get them.When they get them, he, if then alive, would be quite\nwilling to take all the responsibility if they found an unsound or\nunhealthy animal amongst them.He appealed to butchers in Montrose, who\nhad been in the way of killing States or Canadian cattle, if they were not\ntotally free of disease; and he would like to ask them how many Irish\ncattle they killed which were perfectly healthy.If they got stores from\nAmerica, they would not effect a saving in price, but, as they all knew,\nsound healthy cattle fed much quicker than unsound, and were of better\nquality, and thus an additional item of profit would be secured to the\nfarmer.A. Milne, cattle-dealer, Montrose, corroborated Mr.Falconer's\nstatements as to the healthiness of American stock, while Irish cattle, as\na rule, he said, had very bad livers.Adamson, Morphie, said he had recently been in the Western States of\nAmerica, and had seen a number of the ranches in Nebraska, Wyoming, and\nColorado.The cattle there were certainly fine animals--well bred, as a\nrule, either from Herefords or Short-horns, with a dash of the Texan\ncattle in them.When there, he made careful inquiries as to the existence\nof disease, and he was universally told that such a thing as epidemic\ndisease was unknown.No doubt in the southern part of Texas there was a\nlittle Texan fever, but that, like yellow fever, was merely indigenous to\nthe district.He considered it would\nbe a great boon to the farmers of Scotland if they could get cattle L3 or\nL4 cheaper than at present.It would save a very considerable amount of\nmoney in stocking a farm, and would also tell on the profits of the\nfeeders, and the prices paid by the consumers.They had them to spare in\nAmerica in the greatest possible abundance.At a late meeting of the Prairie Cattle Company, having headquarters in\nScotland, sheriff Guthrie Smith expressed the opinion that the great\nprofit in the future of American ranch companies must be the trade in\nyoung cattle.He believed that Scottish farmers would ere long get all\ntheir young cattle, not from Ireland, but from the United States.It did\nnot pay them to breed calves; they were better selling milk.The fattening\nof cattle for the butcher was the paying part of the business, but the\ndifficulty was to get yearlings or two-year-olds at their proper price.Here promised to arise a new outlet for American stock, and one which most\nof us probably never thought of.The proposition had in it the elements\nfor the building up of a great commercial industry and of affording a new\nand rapid impetus to the breeding of cattle upon the plains.But just at\nthis time comes the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Kansas, Maine,\nand Illinois, and of course puts an end to all hopes in this direction,\nfor many months at least.This is the result of the disease at its first\nappearance.Here is prospective loss before the Government veterinary\nsurgeons fairly reach the field of operations against its spread--the loss\nof a trade which would have been worth many millions to the cattle raisers\nof the great West.It is to be feared that this is but the beginning of\nthe losses the disease will entail upon us.Can Congress longer hesitate\nin this matter of providing an efficient law for protection from\ncontagious animal diseases?Our State authorities,\nalso, must be alert, and render all possible aid in preventing the spread\nof this wonderfully infectious disease.*     *     *     *     *\n\nWe have a large number of letters and postal cards asking where various\nseeds, plants, shrubs, trees, silk-worm eggs, bone dust and so on and so\nforth to an indefinite extent, may be obtained.We have answered some of\nthese inquiries by letter, some through the paper, but they still keep\ncoming.We have one favor to ask of those seeking this sort of\ninformation: First look through the advertisements carefully, and see if\nwhat is wanted is not advertised.The seedsmen's advertisements do not, of\ncourse, enumerate all the parties have for sale, but it may be taken for\ngranted that they keep nearly all kinds of grass, grain, and vegetable\nseeds.We would also say to seedsmen that it will probably be found to pay\nthem to advertise the seeds of the new grasses, alfalfa, the special\nfertilizers, etc., that are now being so much inquired about.We have a\nlarge number of inquiries about where to obtain silk-worm eggs.Persons\nwho have them certainly make a mistake in not advertising them freely.O. G. B., SHEBOYGAN FALLS, WIS.--Will you give directions which will be\npractical for tanning skins or pelts with the fur or hair on by the use of\noak bark?ANSWER.--We know of no way the thing can be done unless a part of the\nmethods are used that are employed in the tanning of goat skins for making\nMorocco leather.These are: to soak the skins to soften them; then put\nthem into a lime vat to remove the hair, and after to take the lime out in\na douche consisting of hen and pigeon dung.This done, the skins are then\nsewed up so as to hold the tanning liquid, which consists of a warm and\nstrong decoction of Spanish sumac.The skins are filled with this liquid,\nthen piled up one above the other and subsequently refilled, two or three\ntimes, or as fast as the liquid is forced through the skins.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.If the furs\nor pelts were first soaked to soften them, all the fatty, fleshy matter\ncarefully removed, after sewed up as goat skins are, and then filled and\nrefilled several times with a strong decoction of white oak bark, warm,\nbut not hot, no doubt the result would prove satisfactory.J. F. SCHLIEMAN, HARTFORD, WIS.--Are there any works on the\ncultivation of the blueberry, and if so could you furnish the same?<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Do you\nknow of any parties that cultivate them?ANSWER.--We have never come across anything satisfactory on the\ncultivation of the blueberry except in Le Bon Jardiniere, which says: \"The\nsuccessful cultivation of the whole tribe of Vacciniums is very difficult.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.The shrubs do not live long and are reproduced with much difficulty,\neither by layers or seeds.\"The blueberry, like the cranberry, appears to\nbe a potash plant, the swamp variety not growing well except where the\nwater is soft, the soil peaty above and sandy below.The same appears also\nto be true of the high land blueberry; the soil where they grow is\ngenerally sandy and the water soft.You can procure Le Bon Jardiniere (a\nwork which is a treasure to the amateur in fruit and plants) of Jansen,\nMcClurg & Co., of Chicago, at 30 cents, the franc.Some parties, we think,\noffer blueberry plants for sale, but we do not recollect who they are.H. HARRIS, HOLT'S PRAIRIE, ILL.--Will it do to tile drain land\nwhich has a hard pan of red clay twelve to eighteen inches below the\nsurface?ANSWER.--It will do no harm to the land to drain it if there is a hard pan\nnear the surface, but in order to make tile draining effective on such\nland, the drains will have to be at half the distance common on soils\nwithout the hard pan.SUBSCRIBER, DECATUR, ILL.--In testing seed corn, what per cent must sprout\nto be called first-class.I have some twenty bushels of Stowell's\nEvergreen that was carefully gathered, assorted, and shelled by hand.This I have tested by planting twenty-one grains, of which sixteen grew.ANSWER.--Ninety-five, certainly.If five kernels out of twenty-one failed\nto grow, that would be 31 per cent of bad seed, and we should consider the\nquality inferior.But further, if under the favorable condition of trial,\n31 percent failed, ten grains in every twenty-one would be almost sure to,\nin the field.It was a mistake to shell the corn; seed should always\nremain on the cob to the last moment, because if it is machine or\nhand-shelled at low temperature, and put away in bulk, when warm weather\ncomes, it is sure to sweat, and if it heats, the germ is destroyed.Better\nspread your corn out in the dry, and where it will not freeze, as soon as\nyou can.NEBRASKA.--I wish to secure a blue grass pasture in my\ntimber for hogs.Will it be necessary to keep them out till the grass\ngets a good start?Shall I follow the directions you gave Mr.Perkins\nin THE PRAIRIE FARMER, February 9?Is not blue grass pasture the best\nthing I can give my hogs?Better do so, and you will then be more likely to get a good\ncatch and full stand.Blue grass is very good for hogs, but it is improved by the addition of\nclover.C. C. SAMUELS, SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--1.What pears would you recommend for\nthis latitude?I have some grape\nvines, light  fruit, but late, Elvira, I think the nurseryman told\nme, which appear to be suffering from something at the roots.What is the\nphylloxera, and what shall I do to my grape vines if they infest the\nroots?ANSWER.--The Bartlett for _certain_--it being the best of all the\npears--and the Kieffer and Le Conte for _experiment_.If the latter\nsucceed you will have lots of nice large fruit just about as desirable for\neating as a Ben Davis apple in May.We know of one only, the Tyson, a\nsmallish summer pear that never blights, at least in some localities,\nwhere all others do more or less.If your Elviras are afflicted with\nthe phylloxera, a root-bark louse, manure and fertilize them at once, and\nirrigate or water them in the warm season.The French vine-growers seem at\nlast to have found out that lice afflict half starved grape roots, as they\ndo half starved cattle, and that they have only to feed and water\ncarefully to restore their vines to health.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.J. S. S., SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--I am not a stock man nor a farmer; but I have\nsome pecuniary interests, in common with others, my friends, in a Kansas\ncattle ranch.I am therefore a good deal exercised about this\nfoot-and-mouth disease.Is it the terrible scourge reported by one cattle\ndoctor, who, according to the papers, says, \"the only remedies are fire or\ndeath.\"ANSWER.--The disease is a bad one, very contagious, but easily yields to\nremedies in the first stages.THOMAS V. JOHNSON, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a report here that your draft\nhorses of all breeds are not crossing with satisfaction on your common\nsteeds in Illinois, and that not more twenty five in one hundred of the\nmares for the last three years have thrown foal, nor will they the present\nseason.ANSWER.--Our correspondent has certainly been misinformed, or is an\nunconscious victim of local jealousy, as he may easily convince himself by\nvisiting interior towns, every one of which is a horse market.BY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.A neighbor of mine who has been intending to purchase store cattle and\nsheep at the Chicago Stock Yards soon, asked me last night what I thought\nabout his doing so.I asked him if he had read what THE PRAIRIE\nFARMER and other papers had contained of late regarding foot-and-mouth\ndisease in Maine, Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa.He had not; did not take the\npapers, and had not heard anything about the disease here or in England.Then I explained to him, as best I could, its nature, contagious\ncharacter, etc., and having a PRAIRIE FARMER in my pocket, read him your\nbrief history of the ailment in Great Britain.Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question\nabout buying cattle and sheep at the stock yards?She reports Lessing\u2019s words as follows: \u201cYou\nwill feel sometime what a genius Goethe is, I\u00a0am sure of this.I\u00a0have\nalways said I would give ten years of my own life if I had been able to\nlengthen Sterne\u2019s by one year, but Goethe consoles me in some measure\nfor his loss.\u201d[16]\n\nIt would be absurd to attach any importance to this variation of\nstatement.It does not indicate necessarily an affection for Sterne and\na regret at his loss, mathematically doubled in these seven or eight\nyears between Sterne\u2019s death and the time of Lessing\u2019s conversation with\nSara Meyer; it probably arises from a failure of memory on the part of\nthe lady, for Bode\u2019s narrative of the anecdote was printed but a few\nmonths after Sterne\u2019s death, and Lessing made no effort to correct an\ninaccuracy of statement, if such were the case, though he lived to see\nfour editions of Bode\u2019s translation and consequently so many repetitions\nof his expressed but impossible desire.Erich Schmidt[17] reduces this\nwillingness on Lessing\u2019s part to one year,--an unwarranted liberty.These two testimonies of Lessing\u2019s devotion are of importance in\ndefining his attitude toward Yorick.They attest the fact that this was\nno passing fancy, no impulsive thought uttered on the moment when the\nnews of Sterne\u2019s death was brought to him, and when the Sentimental\nJourney could have been but a few weeks in his hands, but a deep-seated\ndesire, born of reflection and continued admiration.[18] The addition of\nthe word \u201cReisen\u201d in Bode\u2019s narrative is significant, for it shows that\nLessing must have become acquainted with the Sentimental Journey before\nApril 6, the date of the notice of Sterne\u2019s death in the _Hamburgische\nAdress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_;[19] that is, almost immediately after its\nEnglish publication, unless Bode, in his enthusiasm for the book which\nhe was offering the public, inserted the word unwarrantably in Lessing\u2019s\nstatement.With emphatic protestations, disclaiming\nvanity in appealing to the authority of so distinguished a friend, Bode\nproceeds to relate more in detail Lessing\u2019s connection with his\nendeavor.He does not say that Lessing suggested the translation to him,\nthough his account has been interpreted to mean that, and this fact has\nbeen generally accepted by the historians of literature and the\nbiographers of Lessing.[20] The tone of Bode\u2019s preface, however, rather\nimplies the contrary, and no other proof of the supposition is\navailable.What Bode does assert is merely that the name of the scholar\nwhom he quotes as having expressed a willingness to give a part of his\nown life if Sterne\u2019s literary activity might be continued, would create\na favorable prepossession for his original (\u201cein g\u00fcnstiges Vorurtheil\u201d),\nand that a translator is often fortunate enough if his selection of a\nbook to translate is not censured.All this implies, on Lessing\u2019s part,\nonly an approval of Bode\u2019s choice, a\u00a0fact which would naturally follow\nfrom the remarkable statement of esteem in the preceding sentence.Bode\nsays further that out of friendship for him and regard for the reader of\ntaste, this author (Lessing), had taken the trouble to go through the\nwhole translation, and then he adds the conventional request in such\ncircumstances, that the errors remaining may be attributed to the\ntranslator and not to the friend.The use of the epithet \u201cempfindsam\u201d for \u201csentimental\u201d is then the\noccasion for some discussion, and its source is one of the facts\ninvolved in Sterne\u2019s German vogue which seem to have fastened themselves\non the memory of literature.Bode had in the first place translated the\nEnglish term by \u201csittlich,\u201d a\u00a0manifestly insufficient if not flatly\nincorrect rendering, but his friend coined the word \u201cempfindsam\u201d for the\noccasion and Bode quotes Lessing\u2019s own words on the subject:\n\n\u201cBemerken Sie sodann dass sentimental ein neues Wort ist.War es Sternen\nerlaubt, sich ein neues Wort zu bilden, so muss es eben darum auch\nseinem Uebersetzer erlaubt seyn.Die Engl\u00e4nder hatten gar kein\nAdjectivum von Sentiment: wir haben von Empfindung mehr als eines,\nempfindlich, empfindbar, empfindungsreich, aber diese sagen alle etwas\nanders.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Wenn eine m\u00fchsame Reise eine Reise\nheisst, bey der viel M\u00fche ist: so kann ja auch eine empfindsame Reise\neine Reise heissen, bey der viel Empfindung war.Ich will nicht sagen,\ndass Sie die Analogie ganz auf ihrer Seite haben d\u00fcrften.Aber was die\nLeser vors erste bey dem Worte noch nicht denken m\u00f6gen, sie sich nach\nund nach dabey zu denken gew\u00f6hnen.\u201d[21]\n\nThe statement that Sterne coined the word \u201csentimental\u201d is undoubtedly\nincorrect,[22] but no one seems to have discovered and corrected the\nerror till Nicolai\u2019s article on Sterne in the _Berlinische\nMonatsschrift_ for February, 1795, in which it is shown that the word\nhad been used in older English novels, in \u201cSir Charles Grandison\u201d\nindeed.[23] It may well be that, as B\u00f6ttiger hints,[24] the coining of\nthe word \u201cempfindsam\u201d was suggested to Lessing by Abbt\u2019s similar\nformation of \u201cempfindnisz.\u201d[25]\n\n  [Transcriber\u2019s Note:\n  The reference is to B\u00f6ttinger, not to the present text.]The preface to this first edition of Bode\u2019s translation of the\nSentimental Journey contains, further, a\u00a0sketch of Sterne\u2019s life,[26]\nhis character and his works.Bode relates the familiar story of the dog,\nbut misses the point entirely in rendering \u201cpuppy\u201d by \u201cGeck\u201d in Sterne\u2019s\nreply, \u201cSo lang er ein Geck ist.\u201d The watchcoat episode is narrated, and\na brief account is given of Sterne\u2019s fortunes in London with Tristram\nShandy and the sermons.Allusion has already been made to the hints\nthrown out in this sketch relative to the reading of Sterne in Germany.A\u00a0translation from Shandy of the passage descriptive of Parson Yorick\nserves as a portrait for Sterne.A second edition of Bode\u2019s work was published in 1769.The preface,\nwhich is dated \u201cAnfang des Monats Mai, 1769,\u201d is in the main identical\nwith the first, but has some significant additions.A\u00a0word is said\nrelative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.[27]\nBode confesses further that the excellence of his work is due to Ebert\nand Lessing,[28] though modesty compelled his silence in the previous\npreface concerning the source of his aid.Bode admits that even this\ndisclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a critic in the\n_Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_,[29] who openly named\nLessing as the scholar referred to in the first introduction.The\naddition and prominence of Ebert\u2019s name is worthy of note, for in spite\nof the plural mention[30] in the appendix to the introduction, his first\nacknowledgment is to one friend only and there is no suggestion of\nanother counselor.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.Ebert\u2019s connection with the Bode translation has been\noverlooked in the distribution of influence, while the memorable coining\nof the new word, supplemented by B\u00f6ttiger\u2019s unsubstantiated statements,\nhas emphasized Lessing\u2019s service in this regard.Ebert is well-known as\nan intelligent and appreciative student of English literature, and as a\ntranslator, but his own works betray no trace of imitation or admiration\nof Sterne.The final words of this new preface promise a translation of the\ncontinuation of the Sentimental Journey; the spurious volumes of\nEugenius are, of course, the ones meant here.This introduction to the\nsecond edition remains unchanged in the subsequent ones.The text of the\nsecond edition was substantially an exact reproduction of the first,\nbut Bode allowed himself frequent minor changes of word or phrase, an\nalteration occurring on an average once in about three pages.Bode\u2019s\nchanges are in general the result of a polishing or filing process, in\nthe interest of elegance of discourse, or accuracy of translation.Bode\nacknowledges that some of the corrections were those suggested by a\nreviewer,[31] but states that other passages criticised were allowed to\nstand as they were.He says further that he would have asked those\nfriends who had helped him on his translation itself to aid him in the\nalterations, if distance and other conditions had allowed.The reference\nhere is naturally to his separation from Ebert, who was in Braunschweig,\nbut the other \u201cconditions\u201d which could prevent a continuation of\nLessing\u2019s interest in the translation and his assistance in revision are\nnot evident.Lessing was in Hamburg during this period, and hence his\nadvice was available.Bode\u2019s retranslation of the passage with which Sterne\u2019s work closed\nshows increased perception and appreciation for the subtleness of\nSterne\u2019s indecent suggestions, or, perhaps, a\u00a0growing lack of timidity\nor scruple in boldly repeating them.It is probable that the\ncontinuation by Eugenius, which had come into his hands during this\nperiod, had, with its resumption of the point, reminded Bode of the\ninadequacy and inexactness of his previous rendering.At almost precisely the same time that Bode\u2019s translation appeared,\nanother German rendering was published, a\u00a0fact which in itself is\nsignificant for the determination of the relative strength of appeal as\nbetween Sterne\u2019s two works of fiction.The title[32] of this version was\n\u201cVersuch \u00fcber die menschliche Natur in Herrn Yoricks, Verfasser des\nTristram Shandy, Reisen durch Frankreich und Italien, aus dem\nEnglischen.\u201d It was dated 1769 and was published at the \u201cF\u00fcrstliche\nWaisenhausbuchhandlung,\u201d in Braunschweig.The preface is signed\nBraunschweig, September 7, 1768, and the book was issued in September or\nOctober.The anonymous translator was Pastor Mittelstedt[33] in\nBraunschweig (Hirsching und J\u00f6rdens say Hofprediger), whom the partisan\nB\u00f6ttiger calls the ever-ready manufacturer of translations (der allezeit\nfertige Uebersetzungsfabrikant).Behmer tentatively suggests Weis as the\ntranslator of this early rendering, an error into which he is led\nevidently by a remark in Bode\u2019s preface in which the apologetic\ntranslator states the rumor that Weis was engaged in translating the\nsame book, and that he (Bode) would surely have locked up his work in\nhis desk if the publisher had not thereby been led to suffer loss.This first edition of the Mittelstedt translation contains 248 pages and\nis supplied with a preface which is, like Bode\u2019s, concerned in\nconsiderable measure with the perplexing problem of the translation of\nSterne\u2019s title.The English title is given and the word \u201csentimental\u201d is\ndeclared a new one in England and untranslatable in German.Mittelstedt\nproposes \u201cGef\u00fchlvolle Reisen,\u201d \u201cReisen f\u00fcrs Herz,\u201d \u201cPhilosophische\nReisen,\u201d and then condemns his own suggestions as indeterminate and\nforced.He then goes on to say, \u201cSo I have chosen the title which Yorick\nhimself suggests in the first part.\u201d[34] He speaks of the lavish praise\nalready bestowed on this book by the learned journals, and turns at last\naside to do the obvious: he bemoans Sterne\u2019s death by quoting Hamlet and\ncloses with an apostrophe to Sterne translated from the April number of\nthe _Monthly Review_ for 1768.[35] In 1769, the year when the first\nedition was dated, the Mittelstedt translation was published under a\nslightly altered title, as already mentioned.This second edition of the\nMittelstedt translation in the same year as the first is overlooked by\nJ\u00f6rdens and Hirsching,[36] both of whom give a second and hence really a\nthird edition in 1774.B\u00f6ttiger notes with partisan zeal that Bode\u2019s\ntranslation was made use of in some of the alterations of this second\nedition, and further records the fact that the account of Sterne\u2019s life,\nadded in this edition, was actually copied from Bode\u2019s preface.[37]\n\nThe publication of the Mittelstedt translation was the occasion of a\nbrief controversy between the two translators in contemporary journals.Mittelstedt printed his criticism of Bode\u2019s work in a home paper, the\n_Braunschweiger Intelligenzbl\u00e4tter_, and Bode spoke out his defense in\nthe _Neue Hamburger Zeitung_.That Bode in his second edition adopted\nsome of the reviewer\u2019s suggestions and criticisms has been noted, but in\nthe preface to this edition he declines to resume the strife in spite of\ngeneral expectation of it, but, as a final shot, he delivers himself of\n\u201can article from his critical creed,\u201d that the \u201ccritic is as little\ninfallible as author or translator,\u201d which seems, at any rate, a\u00a0rather\npointless and insignificant contribution to the controversy.Bode\u2019s translation of the third and fourth volumes of Yorick\u2019s\nJourney,[38] that is, the continuation by Eugenius, followed directly\nafter the announcement in the preface to the second edition of the first\ntwo volumes, as already mentioned.B\u00f6ttiger states that Bode had this\ncontinuation from Alberti and knew it before anyone else in Germany.It\nwas published in England in the spring of 1769, and was greeted with a\ndisapproval which was quite general, and it never enjoyed there any\nconsiderable genuine popularity or recognition.Bode published this\ntranslation of Stevenson\u2019s work without any further word of comment or\nexplanation whatsoever, a\u00a0fact which easily paved the way for a\nmisunderstanding relative to the volumes, for Bode was frequently\nregarded as their author and held responsible for their defects.Bode\nhimself never made any satisfactory or adequate explanation of his\nattitude toward these volumes, and the reply to Goeze in the\nintroduction to his translation of Shandy is the nearest approach to a\ndiscussion of his position.But there Bode is concerned only with the\nattack made by the Hamburg pastor upon his character, an inference drawn\nfrom the nature of the book translated, and the character of the\ntranslation; in the absence of a new edition in which \u201cMine and His\nshall be marked off by distinct boundaries,\u201d he asks Goeze only to send\nto him, and beg \u201cfor original and translation,\u201d naturally for the\npurpose of comparison.This evasive reply is Bode\u2019s only defense or\nexplanation.B\u00f6ttiger claims that the review of Bode\u2019s translation in\nthe _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ did much to spread the idea of\nBode\u2019s authorship, though the reviewer in that periodical[39] only\nsuggests the possibility of German authorship, a\u00a0suspicion aroused by\nthe substitution of German customs and motif and word-play, together\nwith contemporary literary allusion, allusion to literary mediocrities\nand obscurities, of such a nature as to preclude the possibility of the\nbook\u2019s being a literal translation from the English.The exact amount and the nature of Bode\u2019s divergence from the original,\nhis alterations and additions, have never been definitely stated by\nanyone.The reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ is\nmanifestly ignorant of the original.B\u00f6ttiger is indefinite and\npartisan, yet his statement of the facts has been generally accepted and\nconstantly repeated.He admits the German coloring given the translation\nby Bode through German allusions and German word-plays: he says that\nBode allowed himself these liberties, feeling that he was no longer\ndealing with Sterne, a\u00a0statement of motive on Bode\u2019s part which the\nlatter never makes and never hints at.The only absolute additions which\nB\u00f6ttiger mentions as made by Bode to the narrative of Eugenius are the\nepisode, \u201cDas H\u00fcndchen,\u201d and the digression, \u201cDie Moral.\u201d The erroneous\nidea herein implied has been caught up and repeated by nearly everyone\nwho has mentioned Bode\u2019s translation of the work.[40] The less certain\nallusion to \u201cDie Moral\u201d has been lost sight of, and \u201cDas H\u00fcndchen\u201d alone\nhas been remembered as representing this activity on Bode\u2019s part.In\nfact this episode is only one of many pure creations on Bode\u2019s part and\none of the briefer.In the first pages of these volumes Bode is faithful\nto the original, a\u00a0fact suggesting that examination or comparison of the\noriginal text and Bode\u2019s translation was never carried beyond the first\ntwo-score pages; yet here, it would seem, Bode\u2019s rendering was less\ncareful, more open to censure for inaccuracy, than in the previous\nvolumes.[41]\n\nThis method of translation obtains up to page 48, then Bode omits a\nhalf-page of half-innocent, half-revolting suggestion, the story of the\nCordelier, and from the middle of page 49 to page 75, twenty-five pages,\nthe translator adds material absolutely his own.This fiction,\nintroducing Yorick\u2019s sentimental attitude toward the snuff-box, resuming\na sentimental episode in Sterne\u2019s work, full of tears and sympathy,\nis especially characteristic of Yorick, as the Germans conceived him.The story is entitled \u201cDas M\u00fcndel,\u201d[42] \u201cThe Ward,\u201d and is evidently\nintended as a masculine companion-piece to the fateful story of Maria of\nMoulines, linked to it even in the actual narrative itself.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.An\nunfortunate, half-crazed man goes about in silence, performing little\nservices in an inn where Yorick finds lodging.He was once the brilliant son of the village miller, was\nwell-educated and gifted with scholarly interests and attainments.While\ninstructing some children at Moulines, he meets a peasant girl, and love\nis born between them.An avaricious brother opposes Jacques\u2019s passion\nand ultimately confines him in secret, spreading the report in Moulines\nof his faithlessness to his love.After a tragedy has released Jacques\nfrom his unnatural bondage, he learns of his loved one\u2019s death and loses\nhis mental balance through grief.Such an addition to the brief pathos\nof Maria\u2019s story, as narrated by Sterne, such a forced explanation of\nthe circumstances, is peculiarly commonplace and inartistic.Sterne\ninstinctively closed the episode with sufficient allowance for the\nexercise of the imagination.Following this addition, the section \u201cSlander\u201d of the original is\nomitted.The story of the adventure with the opera-girl is much changed.The bald indecency of the narrative is somewhat softened by minor\nsubstitutions and omissions.Nearly two pages are inserted here, in\nwhich Yorick discourses on the difference between a sentimental traveler\nand an _avanturier_.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.On pages 122-126, the famous \u201cH\u00fcndchen\u201d episode is\nnarrated, an insertion taking the place of the hopelessly vulgar \u201cRue\nTireboudin.\u201d According to this narrative, Yorick, after the fire, enters\na home where he finds a boy weeping over a dead dog and refusing to be\ncomforted with promises of other canine possessions.The critics united\nin praising this as being a positive addition to the Yorick adventures,\nas conceived and related in Sterne\u2019s finest manner.After the lapse of\nmore than a century, one can acknowledge the pathos, the humanity of the\nincident, but the manner is not that of Sterne.It is a simple,\nstraight-forward relation of the touching incident, introducing that\nelement of the sentimental movement which bears in Germany a close\nrelation to Yorick, and was exploited, perhaps, more than any other\nfeature of his creed, as then interpreted, _i.e._, the sentimental\nregard for the lower animals.[43] But there is lacking here the\ninevitable concomitant of Sterne\u2019s relation of a sentimental situation,\nthe whimsicality of the narrator in his attitude at the time of the\nadventure, or reflective whimsicality in the narration.Sterne is always\nwhimsically quizzical in his conduct toward a sentimental condition, or\ntoward himself in the analysis of his conduct.After the \u201cVergebene Nachforschung\u201d (Unsuccessful Inquiry), which agrees\nwith the original, Bode adds two pages covering the touching solicitude\nof La Fleur for his master\u2019s safety.This addition is, like the\n\u201cH\u00fcndchen\u201d episode, just mentioned, of considerable significance, for it\nillustrates another aspect of Sterne\u2019s sentimental attitude toward human\nrelations, which appealed to the Germany of these decades and was\nextensively copied; the connection between master and man.Following\nthis added incident, Bode omits completely three sections of Eugenius\u2019s\noriginal narrative, \u201cThe Definition,\u201d \u201cTranslation of a Fragment\u201d and\n\u201cAn Anecdote;\u201d all three are brief and at the same time of baldest, most\nrevol", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "In all, Bode\u2019s direct additions amount in this\nfirst volume to about thirty-three pages out of one hundred and\nforty-two.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.The divergences from the original are in the second volume\n(the fourth as numbered from Sterne\u2019s genuine Journey) more marked and\nextensive: above fifty pages are entirely Bode\u2019s own, and the individual\nalterations in word, phrase, allusion and sentiment are more numerous\nand unwarranted.The more significant of Bode\u2019s additions are here\nnoted.\u201cDie Moral\u201d (pages 32-37) contains a fling at Collier, the author\nof a mediocre English translation of Klopstock\u2019s \u201cMessias,\u201d and another\nagainst K\u00f6lbele, a\u00a0contemporary German novelist, whose productions have\nlong since been forgotten.[44]\n\nEugenius\u2019s chapter, \u201cVendredi-Saint,\u201d Bode sees fit to alter in a rather\nextraordinary way, by changing the personnel and giving it quite another\nintroduction.He inserts here a brief account of Walter Shandy, his\ndisappointment at Tristram\u2019s calamitous nose and Tristram\u2019s name, and\nhis resolve to perfect his son\u2019s education; and then he makes the visit\nto M\u2019lle Laborde, as narrated by Eugenius, an episode out of Walter\nShandy\u2019s book, which was written for Tristram\u2019s instruction, and,\naccording to Bode, was delivered for safe-keeping into Yorick\u2019s hands.Bode changes M\u2019lle Laborde into M\u2019lle Gillet, and Walter Shandy is her\nvisitor, not Yorick.Bode allows himself some verbal changes and softens\nthe bald suggestion at the end.Bode\u2019s motive for this startling change\nis not clear beyond question.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.The most plausible theory is that the open\nand gross suggestion of immoral relation between Yorick, the clergyman\nand moralist, and the Paris maiden, seemed to Bode inconsistent with the\nthen current acceptation of Yorick\u2019s character; and hence he preferred\nby artifice to foist the misdemeanor on to the elder Shandy.The second extensive addition of Bode\u2019s in this volume is the section\ncalled \u201cDie Erkl\u00e4rung,\u201d and its continuation in the two following\ndivisions, a\u00a0story which unites itself with the \u201cFragment\u201d in Sterne\u2019s\noriginal narration.Yorick is ill and herbs are brought to him in paper\nwrappings which turn out to contain the story of the decayed gentleman,\nwhich, according to Sterne\u2019s relation, the Notary was beginning to\nwrite.It will be remembered that the introduction in Sterne was also\nbrought by La Fleur as a bit of wrapping paper.This curious\ncoincidence, this prosaic resumption of the broken narrative, is na\u00efve\nat least, but can hardly commend itself to any critic as being other\nthan commonplace and bathetic.The story itself, as related by the dying\nman is a tale of accidental incest told quietly, earnestly, but without\na suggestion of Sterne\u2019s wit or sentiment.In the next section, emanating entirely from Bode, \u201cVom\nGesundheitstrinken,\u201d the author is somewhat more successful in catching\nthe spirit of Sterne in his buoyancy, and in his whimsical anecdote\ntelling: it purports to be an essay by the author\u2019s friend, Grubbius.The last addition made by Bode[45] introduces once more Yorick\u2019s\nsentiment relative to man\u2019s treatment of the animal world.Yorick,\nwalking in the garden of an acquaintance, shoots a sparrow and meets\nwith reproof from the owner of the garden.Yorick protests prosaically\nthat it was only a sparrow, yet on being assured that it was also a\nliving being, he succumbs to vexation and self-reproof at his own\nfailure to be true to his own higher self.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.A\u00a0similar regret, a\u00a0similar\nremorse at sentimental thoughtlessness, is recorded of the real Yorick\nin connection with the Franciscan, Lorenzo.But there is present in\nSterne\u2019s story the inevitable element of caprice in thought or action,\nthe whimsical inconsistency of varying moods, not a mere commonplace\nlapse from a sentimental creed.In one case, Yorick errs through whim,\nin the other, merely through heedlessness.Bode\u2019s attitude toward the continuation of Eugenius and the general\nnature of his additions have been suggested by the above account.A\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the omissions and the verbal changes would indicate that\nthey were made frequently because of the indecency of the original;\nthe transference of the immorality in the episode of M\u2019lle.Laborde and\nWalter Shandy, if the reason above suggested be allowed, is further\nproof of Bode\u2019s solicitude for Yorick\u2019s moral reputation.Yet the\nretention of the episode \u201cLes Gants d\u2019Amour\u201d in its entirety, and of\nparts of the continued story of the Piedmontese, may seem inconsistent\nand irreconcilable with any absolute objection on Bode\u2019s part other than\na quantitative one, to this loathesome element of the Eugenius\nnarrative.Albrecht Wittenberg[46] in a letter to Jacobi, dated Hamburg, April 21,\n1769, says he reads that Riedel is going to continue \u201cYorick\u2019s Reisen,\u201d\nand comments upon the exceedingly difficult undertaking.Nothing further\nis known of this plan of Riedel\u2019s.[Footnote 1: Various German authorities date the Sentimental\n    Journey erroneously 1767.753;

Journey, as implied in the previous\nchapter, brought Sterne into vital connection with literary impulses and\nemotional experiences in Germany, and his position as a leader was at\nonce recognized.Because of the immediate translations, the reviews of\nthe English original are markedly few, even in journals which gave\nconsiderable attention to English literary affairs.The _Neue Bibliothek\nder sch\u00f6nen Wissenschaften_[1] purposely delays a full review of the\nbook because of the promised translation, and contents itself with the\nremark, \u201cthat we have not read for a long time anything more full of\nsentiment and humor.\u201d Yet, strangely enough, the translation is never\nworthily treated, only the new edition of 1771 is mentioned,[2] with\nespecial praise of F\u00fcger\u2019s illustrations.Other journals devote long reviews to the new favorite: according to the\n_Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen_[3] all the learned\nperiodicals vied with one another in lavish bestowal of praise upon\nthese Journeys.The journals consulted go far toward justifying this\nstatement.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ reviews both the Bode and\nMittelstedt renderings, together with Bode\u2019s translation of Stevenson\u2019s\ncontinuation, in the second volume of the Anhang to Volumes I-XII.[4]\nThe critique of Bode\u2019s work defines, largely in the words of the book\nitself, the peculiar purpose and method of the Journey, and comments\nbriefly but with frank enthusiasm on the various touching incidents of\nthe narrative: \u201cNur ein von der Natur verwahrloseter bleibt dabei kalt\nund gleichg\u00fcltig,\u201d remarks the reviewer.The conception of Yorick\u2019s\npersonal character, which prevailed in Germany, obtained by a process of\nelimination and misunderstanding, is represented by this critic when he\nrecords without modifying his statement: \u201cVarious times Yorick shows\nhimself as the most genuine foe of self-seeking, of immoral _double\nentendre_, and particularly of assumed seriousness, and he scourges them\nemphatically.\u201d The review of the third and fourth parts contains a\nsimilar and perhaps even more significant passage illustrating the view\nof Yorick\u2019s character held by those who did not know him and had the\nprivilege of admiring him only in his writings and at a safe distance.\u201cYorick,\u201d he says, \u201calthough he sometimes brings an event, so to speak,\nto the brink of an indecorous issue, manages to turn it at once with the\ngreatest delicacy to a decorous termination.Or he leaves it incomplete\nunder such circumstances that the reader is impressed by the rare\ndelicacy of mind of the author, and can never suspect that such a man,\nwho never allows a _double entendre_ to enter his mind without a blush,\nhas entertained an indecent idea.\u201d This view is derived from a somewhat\nshort-sighted reading of the Sentimental Journey: the obvious Sterne of\nTristram Shandy, and the more insidiously concealed creator of the\nJourney could hardly be characterized discriminatingly by such a\nstatement.Sterne\u2019s cleverness consists not in suggesting his own\ninnocence of imagination, but in the skill with which he assures his\nreader that he is master of the situation, and that no possible\ninterpretation of the passage has escaped his intelligence.To the\nMittelstedt translation is accorded in this review the distinction of\nbeing, in the rendering of certain passages, more correct than Bode\u2019s.A\u00a0reviewer in the _Hallische Neue Gelehrte Zeitung_[5] treats of the\nSentimental Journey in the Mittelstedt translation.He is evidently\nunfamiliar with the original and does not know of Bode\u2019s work, yet his\nadmiration is unbounded, though his critique is without distinction or\ndiscrimination.The _Neue Critische Nachrichten_[6] of Greifswald gives\na review of Bode\u2019s rendering in which a parallel with Shakespeare is\nsuggested.The original mingling of instruction and waggery is commented\nupon, imitation is discouraged, and the work is held up as a test,\nthrough appreciation or failure to appreciate, of a reader\u2019s ability to\nfollow another\u2019s feelings, to understand far-away hints and allusions,\nto follow the tracks of an irregular and errant wit.The _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_ for October 29, 1768,\nregards the book in Bode\u2019s translation as an individual, unparalleled\nwork of genius and discourses at length upon its beneficent medicinal\neffects upon those whose minds and hearts are perplexed and clouded.The wanton passages are acknowledged, but the reviewer asserts that the\nauthor must be pardoned them for the sake of his generous and\nkind-hearted thoughts.The Mittelstedt translation is also quoted and\nparallel passages are adduced to demonstrate the superiority of Bode\u2019s\ntranslation.The Germans naturally learned to know the continuation of Eugenius\nchiefly through Bode\u2019s translation, designated as the third and fourth\nvolumes of the work, and thus because of the sanction of the\nintermediary, were led to regard Stevenson\u2019s tasteless, tedious and\nrevolting narrative with a larger measure of favor than would presumably\nhave been accorded to the original, had it been circulated extensively\nin Germany.After years the _Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung_[7] implies\nincidentally that Bode\u2019s esteeming this continuation worthy of his\nattention is a fact to be taken into consideration in judging its\nmerits, and states that Bode beautified it.Bode\u2019s additions and\nalterations were, as has been pointed out, all directly along the line\nof the Yorick whom the Germans had made for themselves.It is\ninteresting to observe that the reviewer of these two volumes of the\ncontinuation in the _Neue Critische Nachrichten_,[8] while recognizing\nthe inevitability of failure in such a bold attempt, and acknowledging\nthat the outward form of the work may by its similarity be at first\nglance seductive, notes two passages of sentiment \u201cworthy even of a\nYorick,\u201d--the episode \u201cDas H\u00fcndchen\u201d and the anecdote of the sparrows\nwhich the traveler shot in the garden: both are additions on Bode\u2019s\npart, and have no connection with the original.The reviewer thus\nsingled out for especial approval two interpolations by the German\ntranslator, incidents which in their conception and narration have not\nthe true English Yorick ring.The success of the Sentimental Journey increased the interest in the\nincomprehensible Shandy.Lange\u2019s new edition of Z\u00fcckert\u2019s translation\nhas been noted, and before long Bode[9] was induced to undertake a\nGerman rendering of the earlier and longer novel.This translation was\nfinished in the summer of 1774, the preface being dated \u201cEnd of August.\u201d\nThe foreword is mainly concerned with Goeze\u2019s attack on Bode\u2019s personal\ncharacter, a\u00a0thrust founded on Bode\u2019s connection with the Sentimental\nJourney and its continuation.At the close of this introduction Bode\nsays that, without undervaluing the intelligence of his readers, he had\nregarded notes as essential, but because of his esteem for the text,\nand a parental affection for the notes, he has foreborne to insert them\nhere.\u201cSo they still lie in my desk, as many as there are of them, but\nupon pressing hints they might be washed and combed, and then be\npublished under the title perhaps of a \u2018Real und Verballexicon \u00fcber\nTristram Shandy\u2019s Leben und Meinungen.\u2019\u201d This hint of a work of his own,\nserving as a commentary to Tristram Shandy, has been the occasion of\nsome discussion.A\u00a0reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[10]\nin an account of Bode\u2019s and Wichmann\u2019s renderings of \u201cTom Jones,\u201d begs\nBode to fulfill the hopes thus raised, saying he could give Yorick\u2019s\nfriends no more valuable or treasured gift.B\u00f6ttiger in his biographical\nsketch of Bode expressed regret that the work never saw the light,\nadding that the work contained so many allusions to contemporary\ncelebrities and hits upon Bode\u2019s acquaintance that wisdom had consigned\nto oblivion.[11] A\u00a0correspondent, writing to the _Teutscher Merkur_,[12]\nminimizes the importance of this so-called commentary, saying \u201cer hatte\nnie einen Kommentar der Art,.auch nur angefangen auszuarbeiten.Die ganze Sache gr\u00fcndet sich auf eine scherzhafte Aeusserung gegen\nseinem damaligen Freund in Hamburg, welchen er oft mit der ihm eignen\nIronie mit diesem Kommentar zu drohen pflegte.\u201d\n\nThe list of subscribers to Bode\u2019s translation contained upwards of 650\nnames, among which are Boie, Claudius, Einsieder, Gerstenberg, Gleim,\nFr\u00e4ulein von G\u00f6chhausen, Goethe, Hamann, Herder, Hippel, Jacobi,\nKlopstock, Schummel, Wieland (five copies), and Zimmermann.The names of\nEbert and Lessing are not on the list.The number of subscribers in\nMitau (twelve) is worthy of note, as illustrating the interest in Sterne\nstill keenly alive in this small and far away town, undoubtedly a direct\nresult of the admiration so lavishly expressed in other years by Herder,\nHamann and their circle.The translation was hailed then as a masterly achievement of an arduous\ntask, the difficulties of which are only the less appreciated because of\nthe very excellence of the performance.It contrasts most strikingly\nwith its clumsy predecessor in its approximation to Sterne\u2019s deftness of\ntouch, his delicate turns of phrase, his seemingly obvious and facile,\nbut really delicate and accurate choice of expression.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.Z\u00fcckert was\nheavy, commonplace, uncompromisingly literal and bristling with\ninaccuracies.Bode\u2019s work was unfortunately not free from errors in\nspite of its general excellence, yet it brought the book within reach of\nthose who were unable to read it in English, and preserved, in general\nwith fidelity, the spirit of the original.The reviews were prodigal of\npraise.Wieland\u2019s expressions of admiration were full-voiced and\nextensive.[13]\n\nThe _Wandsbecker Bothe_ for October 28, 1774, asserts that many readers\nin England had not understood the book as well as Bode, a\u00a0frequent\nexpression of inordinate commendation; that Bode follows close on the\nheels of Yorick on his most intimate expeditions.The _Frankfurter\nGelehrte Anzeigen_[14] copies in full the translation of the first\nchapter as both Z\u00fcckert and Bode rendered it, and praises the latter in\nunqualified terms; Bode appears as \u201cYorick\u2019s rescuer.\u201d Several years\nlater, in the _Deutsches Museum_, the well-known French translation of\nShandy by Frenais is denounced as intolerable (unertr\u00e4glich) to a German\nwho is acquainted with Bode\u2019s,[15] an opinion emphasized later in the\nsame magazine[16] by Joseph von Retzer.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Indeed, upon these two\ntranslations from Sterne rests Bode\u2019s reputation as a translator.His\n\u201cTom Jones\u201d was openly criticised as bearing too much of Sterne,[17] so\ngreat was the influence of Yorick upon the translator.Klamer Schmidt in\na poem called \u201cKlamersruh, eine l\u00e4ndlich malerische Dichtung,\u201d[18]\ndilating upon his favorite authors during a country winter, calls Bode\n\u201cour Sterne\u201d and \u201cthe ideal translator,\u201d and in some verses by the same\npoet, quoted in the article on Bode in Schlichtegroll\u2019s \u201cNekrolog,\u201d[19]\nis found a very significant stanza expressing Sterne\u2019s immeasurable\nobligation to his German translator:\n\n  \u201cEr geht zu dir nun, unser Bode!Empfang ihn, Yoriks Geist!Auch dein\n  Erbarmt er sich,\n  Errettete vom Tode\n  Der Uebersetzer dich!\u201d\n\nMatthison in his \u201cGruss aus der Heimath,\u201d[20] pays similar tribute in a\nvision connected with a visit to Bode\u2019s resting-place in Weimar.It is a\nfanciful relation: as Bode\u2019s shade is received with jubilation and\ndelight in the Elysian Fields by Cervantes, Rabelais, Montaigne,\nFielding and Sterne, the latter censures Bode for distrusting his own\ncreative power, indicating that he might have stood with the group just\nenumerated, that the fame of being \u201cthe most excellent transcriber\u201d of\nhis age should not have sufficed.In view of all this marked esteem, it is rather surprising to find a few\nyears later a rather sweeping, if apologetic, attack on the rendering of\nShandy.J.\u00a0L. Benzler, the librarian of Graf Stolberg at Wernigerode,\npublished in 1801 a translation of Shandy which bore the legend \u201cNewly\ntranslated into German,\u201d but was really a new edition of Bode\u2019s work\nwith various corrections and alterations.[21] Benzler claims in his\npreface that there had been no translation of the masterpiece worthy of\nthe original, and this was because the existing translation was from the\npen of Bode, in whom one had grown to see the very ideal of a\ntranslator, and because praise had been so lavishly bestowed on the work\nby the critics.He then asserts that Bode never made a translation which\ndid not teem with mistakes; he translated incorrectly through\ninsufficient knowledge of English, confusing words which sound alike,\nmade his author say precisely the opposite of what he really did say,\nwas often content with the first best at hand, with the half-right, and\noften erred in taste;--a\u00a0wholesale and vigorous charge.After such a\ndisparagement, Benzler disclaims all intention to belittle Bode, or his\nservice, but he condescendingly ascribes Bode\u2019s failure to his lowly\norigin, his lack of systematic education, and of early association with\nthe cultured world.Benzler takes Bode\u2019s work as a foundation and\nrewrites.Some of his changes are distinctly advantageous, and that so\nfew of these errors in Bode\u2019s translation were noted by contemporary\ncritics is a proof of their ignorance of the original, or their utter\nconfidence in Bode.[22] Benzler in his preface of justification\nenumerates several extraordinary blunders[23] and then concludes with a\nrather inconsistent parting thrust at Bode, the perpetrator of such\nnonsense, at the critics who could overlook such errors and praise the", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Benzler was severely\ntaken to task in the _Neue Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[24] for his\nshamelessness in rewriting Bode\u2019s translation with such comparatively\ninsignificant alterations, for printing on the title page in brazen\neffrontery \u201cnewly translated into German,\u201d and for berating Bode for his\nfailure after cursing him with condescension.Passages are cited to\ndemonstrate the comparative triviality of Benzler\u2019s work.A\u00a0brief\ncomparison of the two translations shows that Benzler often translates\nmore correctly than his predecessor, but still more often makes\nmeaningless alterations in word-order, or in trifling words where\nnothing is to be gained by such a change.The same year Benzler issued a similar revision of the Sentimental\nJourney,[25] printing again on the title page \u201cnewly translated into\nGerman.\u201d The _Neue Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[26] greets this\nattempt with a similar tart review, containing parallel quotations as\nbefore, proving Benzler\u2019s inconsiderate presumption.Here Benzler had to\nface Bode\u2019s assertion that both Lessing and Ebert had assisted in the\nwork, and that the former had in his kindness gone through the whole\nbook.Benzler treats this fact rather cavalierly and renews his attack\non Bode\u2019s rendering.Benzler resented this review and replied to it in a\nlater number of the same periodical.[27]\n\nNow that a century and more has elapsed, and personal acrimony can no\nlonger play any part in criticism, one may justly admit Benzler\u2019s\nservice in calling attention to inaccurate and inadequate translation,\nat the same time one must condemn utterly his manner of issuing his\nemendations.In 1831 there appeared a translation of Tristram Shandy\nwhich was again but a revision of Bode\u2019s work.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.It bore on the title page\n\u201cNeu \u00fcbertragen von W.\u00a0H.,\u201d and contained a sketch of Sterne\u2019s life.[28]\n\nIn the nineties there seemed to be a renewal of Yorick enthusiasm, and\nat this time was brought forth, at Halle in 1794, a\u00a0profusely annotated\nedition of the Sentimental Journey,[29] which was, according to the\nanonymous editor, a\u00a0book not to be read, but to be studied.Claim is\nmade that the real meaning of the book may be discovered only after\nseveral careful readings, that \u201cempfindsam\u201d in some measure was here\nused in the sense of philosophical, that the book should be treated as a\nwork of philosophy, though clad in pleasing garb; that it should be\nthought out according to its merits, not merely read.Yorick\u2019s failure\nto supply his chapters with any significant or alluring chapter-headings\n(probably the result of indolence on his part) is here interpreted as\nextraordinary sagacity, for he thereby lessens the expectations and\nheightens the effect.\u201cEine Empfindungs-reise\u201d is declared to be a more\nsuitable name than \u201cEmpfindsame Reise,\u201d and comment is made upon the\npurpose of the Journey, the gathering of material for anatomical study\nof the human heart.The notes are numerous and lengthy, constituting a\nquarter to a third of the book, but are replete with padding, pointless\nbabble and occasional puerile inaccuracies.They are largely attempts to\nexplain and to moralize upon Yorick\u2019s emotions,--a\u00a0verbose, childish,\nwitless commentary.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.The Wortregister contains fourteen pages in double\ncolumns of explanations, in general differing very little from the kind\nof information given in the notes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.The _Allgemeine Litteratur\nZeitung_[30] devotes a long review chiefly to the explanation of the\nerrors in this volume, not the least striking of which is the\nexplanation of the reference to Smelfungus, whom everyone knows to have\nbeen Smollett: \u201cThis learned Smelfungus appears to have written nothing\nbut the Journey which is here mentioned.\u201d[31] As an explanation of the\ninitial \u201cH\u201d used by Sterne for Hume, the note is given, \u201cThe author \u2018H\u2019\nwas perhaps a poor one.\u201d[32]\n\nSterne\u2019s letters were issued first in London in 1775, a\u00a0rather\nsurprisingly long time after his death, when one considers how great was\nYorick\u2019s following.According to the prefatory note of Lydia Sterne de\nMedalle in the collection which she edited and published, it was the\nwish of Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Sterne that the correspondence of her husband, which was in\nher possession, be not given to the world, unless other letters bearing\nhis name should be published.This hesitation on her part must be\ninterpreted in such a way as to cast a favorable light on this much\nmaligned gentlewoman, as a delicate reticence on her part, a\u00a0desire to\nretain these personal documents for herself.[33] The power of this\nsentiment must be measured by her refraining from publishing during the\nfive years which intervened between her husband\u2019s death and her own,\nMarch, 1768 to January, 1773--years which were embittered by the\ndistress of straitened circumstances.It will be remembered that an\neffort was made by Mrs.Sterne and her daughter to retrieve their\nfortunes by a life of Sterne which was to be a collaboration by\nStevenson and Wilkes, and urgent indeed was Lydia Sterne\u2019s appeal to\nthese friends of her father to fulfill their promises and lend their\naid.Even when this hope had to be abandoned early in 1770, through the\nfaithlessness of Sterne\u2019s erstwhile companions, the widow and daughter\nturned to other possibilities rather than to the correspondence, though\nin the latter lay a more assured means of accomplishing a temporary\nrevival of their prosperity.This is an evidence of fine feeling on the\npart of Sterne\u2019s widow, with which she has never been duly credited.But an anonymous editor published early in 1775[34] a\u00a0volume entitled\n\u201cLetters from Yorick to Eliza,\u201d a\u00a0brief little collection, the source of\nwhich has never been clear, but whose genuineness has never been\nquestioned.The editor himself waives all claim to proof \u201cwhich might be\ndrawn concerning their authenticity from the character of the gentleman\nwho had the perusal of them, and with Eliza\u2019s permission, faithfully\ncopied them at Bombay.\u201d\n\nIn July of this same year[35] was published a volume entitled \u201cSterne\u2019s\nLetters to His Friends on Various Occasions, to which is added his\nHistory of a Watchcoat with Explanatory Notes,\u201d containing twelve\nletters (one by Dr.Eustace) and the watchcoat story.Some of these\nletters had appeared previously in British magazines, and one, copied\nfrom the _London Magazine_, was translated in the _Wandsbecker Bothe_\nfor April 16, 1774.[36] A\u00a0translation of the same letter was given in\nthe _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_, 1774, pp.Three of these\nletters only are accepted by Prof.7, 124, the letter\nof Dr.4-11 have been judged as\nof doubtful authenticity.11 and 12 (\u201cI beheld her\ntender look\u201d and \u201cI\u00a0feel the weight of obligation\u201d) are in the standard\nten-volume edition of Sterne,[37] but the last letter is probably\nspurious also.The publication of the letters from Yorick to Eliza was the\njustification afforded Lydia Sterne de Medalle for issuing her father\u2019s\ncorrespondence according to her mother\u2019s request: the other volume was\nnot issued till after it was known that Sterne\u2019s daughter was engaged in\nthe task of collecting and editing his correspondence.Indeed, the\neditor expressly states in his preface that it is not the purpose of the\nbook to forestall Mme.Medalle\u2019s promised collection; that the letters\nin this volume are not to be printed in hers.Medalle added to\nher collection the \u201cFragment in the manner of Rabelais\u201d and the\ninvaluable, characteristic scrap of autobiography, which was written\nparticularly for \u201cmy Lydia.\u201d The work appeared at Becket\u2019s in three\nvolumes, and the dedication to Garrick was dated June, 1775; but, as the\nnotice in the _Monthly Review_ for October[39] asserts that they have\n\u201cbeen published but a few days,\u201d this date probably represents the time\nof the completion of the task, or the inception of the printer\u2019s\nwork.[40] During the same year the spurious letters from Eliza to Yorick\nwere issued.Naturally Sterne\u2019s letters found readers in Germany, the Yorick-Eliza\ncorrespondence being especially calculated to awaken response.[41] The\nEnglish edition of the \u201cLetters from Yorick to Eliza\u201d was reviewed in\nthe _Neue Bibliothek der sch\u00f6nen Wissenschaften_,[42] with a hint that\nthe warmth of the letters might easily lead to a suspicion of unseemly\nrelationship, but the reviewer contends that virtue and rectitude are\npreserved in the midst of such extraordinary tenderness, so that one may\ninterpret it as a Platonic rather than a sensual affection.Yet this\nreview cannot be designated as distinctive of German opinion, for it\ncontains no opinion not directly to be derived from the editor\u2019s\nforeword, and that alone; indeed, the wording suggests decidedly that\nsource.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitung_[43] for April 15, 1775,\nreviews the same English edition, but the notice consists of an\nintroductory statement of Eliza\u2019s identity and translation of parts of\nthree letters, the \u201cLord Bathurst letter,\u201d the letter involving the\ncriticism of Eliza\u2019s portraits,[44] and the last letter to Eliza.The\ntranslation is very weak, abounding in elementary errors; for example,\n\u201cShe has got your picture and likes it\u201d becomes \u201cSie hat Ihr Bildniss\ngemacht, es ist \u00e4hnlich,\u201d and \u201cI\u00a0beheld you.as a very plain woman\u201d\nis rendered \u201cund hielt Sie f\u00fcr nichts anders als eine Frau.\u201d The same\njournal,[45] August 5, reviews the second collection of Sterne\u2019s\nletters, but there is no criticism, merely an introductory statement\ntaken from the preface, and the translation of two letters, the one to\nMistress V., \u201cOf two bad cassocs, fair lady,\u201d and the epistle beginning,\n\u201cI\u00a0snatch half an hour while my dinner is getting ready.\u201d The\n_G\u00f6ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen_, 1776, p.382, also gives in a review\ninformation concerning this anonymous collection, but no criticism.One would naturally look to Hamburg for translations of these epistles.In the very year of their appearance in England we find \u201cYorick\u2019s Briefe\nan Eliza,\u201d Hamburg, bey C.\u00a0E. Bohn, 1775;[46] \u201cBriefe von Eliza an\nYorick,\u201d Hamburg, bey Bode, 1775; and \u201cBriefe von (Yorick) Sterne an\nseine Freunde nebst seiner Geschichte eines Ueberrocks,\u201d Hamburg, bey\nBohn, 1775.The translator\u2019s name is not given, but there is every\nreason to suppose that it was the faithful Bode, though only the first\nvolume is mentioned in J\u00f6rdens\u2019 account of him, and under his name in\nGoedeke\u2019s \u201cGrundriss.\u201d Contemporary reviewers attributed all three books\nto Bode, and internal evidence goes to prove it.[47]\n\nThe first volume contains no translator\u2019s preface, and the second, the\nspurious Eliza letters, only a brief footnote to the translation of the\nEnglish preface.In this note Bode\u2019s identity is evident in the\nfollowing quotation: He says he has translated the letters \u201cbecause I\nbelieve that they will be read with pleasure, and because I fancy I have\na kind of vocation to give in German everything that Sterne has written,\nor whatever has immediate relation to his writings.\u201d This note is dated\nHamburg, September 16, 1775.In the third volume, the miscellaneous\ncollection, there is a translator\u2019s preface in which again Bode\u2019s hand\nis evident.He says he knows by sure experience that Sterne\u2019s writings\nfind readers in Germany; he is assured of the authenticity of the\nletters, but is in doubt whether the reader is possessed of sufficient\nknowledge of the attending circumstances to render intelligible the\nallusion of the watchcoat story.To forfend the possibility of such\ndubious appreciation, the account of the watchcoat episode is copied\nword for word from Bode\u2019s introduction to the \u201cEmpfindsame Reise.\u201d[48]\n\nIn this same year, an unknown translator issued in a single volume a\nrendering of these three collections.Medalle\u2019s collection was brought out in Leipzig in an anonymous\ntranslation, which has been attributed to Christian Felix Weisse.[50]\nIts title was \u201cLorenz Sterne\u2019s Briefe an seine vertrautesten Freunde\nnebst einem Fragment im Geschmack des Rabelais und einer von ihm selbst\nverfassten Nachricht von seinem Leben und seiner Familie, herausgegeben\nvon seiner Tochter Mad.Medalle,\u201d Leipzig, 1776, pp.Bode\u2019s translation of Yorick\u2019s letters to Eliza is reviewed in the\n_Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitung_, August 9, 1775, with quotation of the\nsecond letter in full.The same journal notes the translation of the\nmiscellaneous collection, November 4, 1775, giving in full the letter of\nDr.[51] The _Allgemeine deutsche\nBibliothek_[52] reviews together the three Hamburg volumes (Bode) and\nthe Leipzig volume containing the same letters.The utter innocence, the\nunquestionably Platonic character of the relations between Yorick and\nEliza is accepted fully.With keen, critical judgment the reviewer is\ninclined to doubt the originality of the Eliza letters.Two letters by\nYorick are mentioned particularly, letters which bear testimony to\nYorick\u2019s practical benevolence: one describing his efforts in behalf of\na dishonored maiden, and one concerning the old man who fell into\nfinancial difficulties.[53] Both the translations win approval, but\nBode\u2019s is preferred; they are designated as doubtless his.The \u201cBriefe\nan Elisa\u201d (Bode\u2019s translation) are noticed in the _Frankfurter Gelehrte\nAnzeigen_, October 3 and 6, 1775, with unrestrained praise of the\ntranslator, and vigorous asseveration of their authenticity.It is\nrecognized fully that the relation as disclosed was extraordinary among\nmarried people, even Sterne\u2019s amazing statement concerning the fragile\nobstacles which stood in the way of their desires is noted.Yet the\nYorick of these letters is accorded undisguised admiration.His love is\nexalted above that of Swift for Stella, Waller for Sacharissa, Scarron\nfor Maintenon,[54] and his godly fear as here exhibited is cited to\noffset the outspoken avowal of dishonoring desire.[55] Hamann in a\nletter to Herder, June 26, 1780, speaks of the Yorick-Eliza\ncorrespondence quite disparagingly.[56]\n\nIn 1787 another volume of Sterne letters was issued in London, giving\nEnglish and German on opposite pages.[57] There are but six letters and\nall are probably spurious.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.In 1780 there was published a volume of confessedly spurious letters\nentitled \u201cBriefe von Yorick und Elisen, wie sie zwischen ihnen konnten\ngeschrieben werden.\u201d[58] The introduction contains some interesting\ninformation for the determination of the genuineness of the Sterne\nletters.[59] The editor states that the author had written these letters\npurely as a diversion, that the editor had proposed their publication,\nbut was always met with refusal until there appeared in London a little\nvolume of letters which their editor emphatically declared to be\ngenuine.This is evidently the volume published by the anonymous editor\nin 1775, and our present editor declares that he knows Nos.4-10 were\nfrom the same pen as the present confessedly spurious collection.They\nwere mere efforts originally, but, published in provincial papers, found\ntheir way into other journals, and the editor goes on to say, that,\nto his astonishment, he saw one of these epistles included in Lydia\nMedalle\u2019s collection.5, the one beginning, \u201cThe\nfirst time I have dipped my pen in the ink-horn.\u201d These events induced\nthe author to allow the publication.The book itself consists mostly of\na kind of diary kept by Yorick to send to Eliza at Madeira and later to\nIndia, and a corresponding journal written by Eliza on the vessel and at\nMadeira.Yorick\u2019s sermons were inevitably less potent in their appeal, and the\neditions and translations were less numerous.In spite of obvious\neffort, Sterne was unable to infuse into his homiletical discourses any\nconsiderable measure of genuine Shandeism, and his sermons were never as\nwidely popular as his two novels, either among those who sought him for\nwhimsical pastime or for sentimental emotion.The\nearly Swiss translation has been duly noted.The third volume of the Z\u00fcrich edition, which appeared in 1769,\ncontained the \u201cReden an Esel,\u201d which the reviewer in the _Allgemeine\ndeutsche Bibliothek_[60] with acute penetration designates as spurious.Another translation of these sermons was published at Leipzig, according\nto the editor of a later edition[61] (Thorn, 1795), in the same year as\nthe Z\u00fcrich issue, 1769.The _Berlinische Monatsschrift_[62] calls attention to the excellence of\nthe work and quotes the sermons at considerable length.The comment\ncontains the erroneous statement that Sterne was a dissenter, and\nopposed to the established church.The translation published at Thorn in\n1795, evidently building on this information, continues the error, and,\nin explanation of English church affairs, adds as enlightenment the\nthirty-nine articles.This translation is confessedly a working-over of\nthe Leipzig translation already mentioned.It is difficult to discover\nhow these sermons ever became attached to Sterne\u2019s name, and one can\nhardly explain the fact that such a magazine as the _Berlinische\nMonatsschrift_[63] should at that late date publish an article so flatly\ncontradictory to everything for which Sterne stood, so diametrically\nopposed to his career, save with the understanding that gross ignorance\nattended the original introduction and early imitation of Yorick, and\nthat this incomprehension, or one-sided appreciation of the real Sterne\npersisted in succeeding decades.The German Yorick was the champion of\nthe oppressed and downtrodden.The author of the \u201cSermons to Asses\u201d\nappeared as such an opponent of coercion and arbitrary power in church\nand state, an upholder of human rights; hence, possibly, the authorship\nof this book was attributed to Sterne by something the same process as\nthat which, in the age of heroic deeds, associated a miscellaneous\ncollection of performances with a popular hero.The \u201cSermons to Asses\u201d\nwere written by Rev.James Murray (1732-1782), a\u00a0noted dissenting\nminister, long pastor of High Bridge Chapel in Newcastle-on-Tyne.They\nwere published in London in 1768 and dedicated to G.\u00a0W., J.\u00a0W., W.\u00a0R.\nand M.M.--George Whitfield, John Wesley, William Romaine and Martin\nMadan.The English people are represented as burden-bearing asses laden\nwith oppression in the shape of taxes and creeds.[64] They are directed\nagainst the power of the established church.It is needless to state\nthat England never associated these sermons with Sterne.[65] The\nEnglish edition was also briefly reviewed in the _Hamburgische\nAdress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_[66] without connecting the work with\nSterne.The error was made later, possibly by the translator of the\nZ\u00fcrich edition.The new collection of Sterne\u2019s sermons published by Cadell in 1769,\nVols.V, VI, VII, is reviewed by _Unterhaltungen_.[67] A\u00a0selection from\nSterne\u2019s sermon on the Prodigal Son was published in translation in the\n_Hamburgische Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ for April 13, 1768.The new\ncollection of sermons was translated by A.\u00a0E. Klausing and published at\nLeipzig in 1770, containing eighteen sermons.[68]\n\nBoth during Sterne\u2019s life and after his death books were published\nclaiming him as their author.In England contemporary criticism\ngenerally stigmatized these impertinent attempts as dubious, or\nundoubtedly fraudulent.The spurious ninth volume of Shandy has been\nmentioned.[69] The \u201cSermons to Asses\u201d just mentioned also belong here,\nand, with reservation, also Stevenson\u2019s continuation of the Sentimental\nJourney, with its claim to recognition through the continuator\u2019s\nstatement of his relation to Yorick.There remain also a few other books\nwhich need to be mentioned because they were translated into German and\nplayed their part there in shaping the German idea of Yorick.In\ngeneral, it may be said that German criticism was never acute in judging\nthese products, partially perhaps because they were viewed through the\nmedium of an imperfectly mastered foreign tongue, a\u00a0mediocre or an\nadapted translation.These books obtained relatively a much more\nextensive recognition in Germany than in England.In 1769 a curious conglomerate was brought over and issued under the\nlengthy descriptive title: \u201cYoricks Betrachtungen \u00fcber verschiedene\nwichtige und angenehme Gegenst\u00e4nde.Nemlich \u00fcber Nichts, Ueber Etwas,\nUeber das Ding, Ueber die Regierung, Ueber den Toback, Ueber die Nasen,\nUeber die Quaksalber, Ueber die Hebammen, Ueber den Homunculus, Ueber\ndie Steckenpferde, Ueber das Momusglas, Ueber die Ausschweifungen, Ueber\ndie Dunkelkeit im Schreiben, Ueber den Unsinn, Ueber die Verbindung der\nIdeen, Ueber die Hahnreiter, Ueber den Mann in dem Monde, Ueber\nLeibnitzens Monaden, Ueber das was man Vertu nennt, Ueber das Gewissen,\nUeber die Trunkenheit, Ueber den Nachtstuhl, Betrachtungen \u00fcber\nBetrachtungen.--neque--cum lectulus, aut me Porticus excepit, desum\nmihi, Horat.\u201d Frankfurt und Leipzig, 1769,\u00a08vo.The book purported to be\na collection of Sterne\u2019s earliest lucubrations, and the translator\nexpresses his astonishment that no one had ever translated them before,\nalthough they were first issued in 1760.It is without doubt the\ntranslation of an English volume entitled \u201cYorick\u2019s Meditations upon\ninteresting and important subjects,\u201d published by Stevens in London,\n1760.[70] It had been forgotten in England long before some German\nchanced upon it.The preface closes with a long doggerel rhyme, which,\nthe translator says, he has purposely left untranslated.It is, however,\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt original with him, as its contents prove.Yorick in the Elysian Fields is supposed to address himself, he\n\u201canticipates his fate and perceives beforehand that at least one German\ncritic would deem him worthy of his applause.\u201d\n\n  \u201cGo on, poor Yorik, try once more\n  In German Dress, thy fate of yore,\n  Expect few Critics, such, as by\n  The bucket of Philosophy\n  From out the bottom of the well\n  May draw the Sense of what you tell\n  And spy what wit and Morals sound\n  Are in thy Rambles to be found.\u201d\n\nAfter a passage in which the rhymester enlarges upon the probability of\ndistorted judgment, he closes with these lines:\n\n  \u201cDire Fate!but for all that no worse,\n  You shall be WIELAND\u2019S Hobby-Horse,\n  So to HIS candid Name, unbrib\u2019d\n  These meditations be inscrib\u2019d.\u201d\n\nThis was at the time of Wieland\u2019s early enthusiasm, when he was probably\ncontemplating, if not actually engaged upon a translation of Tristram\nShandy.\u201cThy fate of yore\u201d in the second line is evidently a poetaster\u2019s\nacceptation of an obvious rhyme and does not set Yorick\u2019s German\nexperience appreciably into the past.The translator supplies frequent\nfootnotes explaining the allusions to things specifically English.He\nmakes occasional comparison with German conditions, always with the\nclaim that Germany is better off, and needs no such satire.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.The\n_Hallische Neue Gelehrte Zeitungen_ for June 1, 1769, devotes a review\nof considerable length to this translation; in it the reviewer asserts\nthat one would have recognized the father of this creation even if\nYorick\u2019s name had not stood on its forehead; that it closely resembles\nits fellows even if one must place it a degree below the Journey.The\n_Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek_[71] throws no direct suspicion on the\nauthenticity, but with customary insight and sanity of criticism finds\nin this early work \u201ca\u00a0great deal that is insipid and affected.\u201d The\n_Deutsche Bibliothek der sch\u00f6nen Wissenschaften_, however, in a review\nwhich shows a keen appreciation of Sterne\u2019s style, openly avows an\ninclination to question the authenticity, save for the express statement\nof the translator; the latter it agrees to trust.[72] The book is placed\nfar below the Sentimental Journey, below Shandy also, but far above the\nartificial tone of many other writers then popular.This relative\nordering of Sterne\u2019s works is characteristic of German criticism.In the\nlatter part of the review its author seizes on a mannerism, the\nexaggerated use of which emphatically sunders the book from the genuine\nSterne, the monotonous repetition of the critic\u2019s protests and Yorick\u2019s\nverbal conflicts with them.Sterne himself used this device frequently,\nbut guardedly, and in ever-changing variety.Its careless use betrays\nthe mediocre imitator.[73]\n\nThe more famous Koran was also brought to German territory and enjoyed\nthere a recognition entirely beyond that accorded it in England.This\nbook was first given to the world in London as the \u201cPosthumous Works of\na late celebrated Genius deceased;\u201d[74] a\u00a0work in three parts, bearing\nthe further title, \u201cThe Koran, or the Life, Character and Sentiments of\nTria Juncta in Uno, M.\u00a0N.\u00a0A., Master of No Arts.\u201d Richard Griffith was\nprobably the real author, but it was included in the first collected\nedition of Sterne\u2019s works, published in Dublin, 1779.What right, for example, have I to General Grahame's\nprotection now, more than when I first met him?\"\"And narrowly escaped the consequences, you would say?\"answered\nClaverhouse--\"why, I will answer you frankly.Then I thought I had to do\nwith the son of an old roundheaded rebel, and the nephew of a sordid\npresbyterian laird; now I know your points better, and there is that\nabout you which I respect in an enemy as much as I like in a friend.I\nhave learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting, and I\ntrust that you have found that my construction of the information has not\nbeen unfavourable to you.\"\"But yet,\" said Morton--\n\n\"But yet,\" interrupted Grahame, taking up the word, \"you would say you\nwere the same when I first met you that you are now?True; but then, how\ncould I know that?though, by the by, even my reluctance to suspend your\nexecution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation.\"\"Do you expect, General,\" said Morton, \"that I ought to be particularly\ngrateful for such a mark of your esteem?\"\"I tell you I thought\nyou a different sort of person.\"I have half a mind,\" said Claverhouse, \"to contrive you should have six\nmonths' imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure.His chapters\ninspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself.And the noble\ncanon, with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful\nexpressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and high-bred knight,\nof whom it was a pity to see the fall, such was his loyalty to his king,\npure faith to his religion, hardihood towards his enemy, and fidelity to\nhis lady-love!--Ah, benedicite!how he will mourn over the fall of such a\npearl of knighthood, be it on the side he happens to favour, or on the\nother.But, truly, for sweeping from the face of the earth some few\nhundreds of villain churls, who are born but to plough it, the high-born\nand inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathy,--as little, or\nless, perhaps, than John Grahame of Claverhouse.\"\"There is one ploughman in your possession, General, for whom,\" said\nMorton, \"in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which\nsome philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier, I would\nhumbly request your favour.\"\"You mean,\" said Claverhouse, looking at a memorandum book, \"one\nHatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie\nHeadrigg--here I have him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.O, never fear him, if he will be but\ntractable.The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his\naccount some time ago.He is to marry their waiting-maid, I think.He\nwill be allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good\nfortune.\"\"He has no ambition to be a martyr, I believe,\" said Morton.\"'Tis the better for him,\" said Claverhouse.\"But, besides, although the\nfellow had more to answer for, I should stand his friend, for the sake of\nthe blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last\nnight, when seeking assistance for you.I never desert any man who trusts\nme with such implicit confidence.But, to deal sincerely with you, he has\nbeen long in our eye.--Here, Halliday; bring me up the black book.\"The sergeant, having committed to his commander this ominous record of\nthe disaffected, which was arranged in alphabetical order, Claverhouse,\nturning over the leaves as he rode on, began to read names as they\noccurred.\"Gumblegumption, a minister, aged 50, indulged, close, sly, and so\nforth--Pooh!pooh!--He--He--I have him here--Heathercat; outlawed--a\npreacher--a zealous Cameronian--keeps a conventicle among the Campsie\nhills--Tush!--O, here is Headrigg--Cuthbert; his mother a bitter\npuritan--himself a simple fellow--like to be forward in action, but of\nno genius for plots--more for the hand than the head, and might be drawn\nto the right side, but for his attachment to\"--(Here Claverhouse looked\nat Morton, and then shut the book and changed his tone.)\"Faithful and\ntrue are words never thrown away upon me, Mr Morton.You may depend on\nthe young man's safety.\"\"Does it not revolt a mind like yours,\" said Morton, \"to follow a system\nwhich is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure\nindividuals?\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.\"The curates, for their own sakes, willingly collect all these materials\nfor their own regulation in each parish; they know best the black sheep\nof the flock.\"Will you favour me by imparting it?\"\"Willingly,\" said Claverhouse; \"it can signify little, for you cannot\navenge yourself on the curate, as you will probably leave Scotland for\nsome time.\"Morton felt an involuntary\nshudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land;\nbut ere he answered, Claverhouse proceeded to read, \"Henry Morton, son of\nSilas Morton, Colonel of horse for the Scottish Parliament, nephew and\napparent heir of Morton of Milnwood--imperfectly educated, but with\nspirit beyond his years--excellent at all exercises--indifferent to forms\nof religion, but seems to incline to the presbyterian--has high-flown and\ndangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech, and hovers between\na latitudinarian and an enthusiast.Much admired and followed by the\nyouth of his own age--modest, quiet, and unassuming in manner, but in his\nheart peculiarly bold and intractable.He is--Here follow three red\ncrosses, Mr Morton, which signify triply dangerous.You see how important\na person you are.--But what does this fellow want?\"A horseman rode up as he spoke, and gave a letter.Claverhouse glanced it\nover, laughed scornfully, bade him tell his master to send his prisoners\nto Edinburgh, for there was no answer; and, as the man turned back, said\ncontemptuously to Morton--\"Here is an ally of yours deserted from you, or\nrather, I should say, an ally of your good friend Burley--Hear how he\nsets forth--'Dear Sir,' (I wonder when we were such intimates,)'may it\nplease your Excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the\nvictory'--hum--hum--'blessed his Majesty's army.I pray you to understand\nI have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives, and have\nalready several prisoners,' and so forth.Subscribed Basil Olifant--You\nknow the fellow by name, I suppose?\"\"A relative of Lady Margaret Bellenden,\" replied Morton, \"is he not?\"\"Ay,\" replied Grahame, \"and heir-male of her father's family, though a\ndistant one, and moreover a suitor to the fair Edith, though discarded as\nan unworthy one; but, above all, a devoted admirer of the estate of\nTillietudlem, and all thereunto", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\"He takes an ill mode of recommending himself,\" said Morton, suppressing\nhis feelings, \"to the family at Tillietudlem, by corresponding with our\nunhappy party.\"\"O, this precious Basil will turn cat in pan with any man!\"\"He was displeased with the government, because they would\nnot overturn in his favour a settlement of the late Earl of Torwood, by\nwhich his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter; he was\ndispleased with Lady Margaret, because she avowed no desire for his\nalliance, and with the pretty Edith, because she did not like his tall\nungainly person.So he held a close correspondence with Burley, and\nraised his followers with the purpose of helping him, providing always he\nneeded no help, that is, if you had beat us yesterday.And now the rascal\npretends he was all the while proposing the King's service, and, for\naught I know, the council will receive his pretext for current coin, for\nhe knows how to make friends among them--and a dozen scores of poor\nvagabond fanatics will be shot, or hanged, while this cunning scoundrel\nlies hid under the double cloak of loyalty, well-lined with the fox-fur\nof hypocrisy.\"With conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way,\nClaverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to Morton, and\ntreating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner; so\nthat, however uncertain of his fate, the hours he passed in the company\nof this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his\nimagination, and the depth of his knowledge of human nature, that since\nthe period of his becoming a prisoner of war, which relieved him at once\nfrom the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the\ninsurgents, and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment, his\nhours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having\ncommenced actor in public life.He was now, with respect to his fortune,\nlike a rider who has flung his reins on the horse's neck, and, while he\nabandoned himself to circumstances, was at least relieved from the task\nof attempting to direct them.In this mood he journeyed on, the number of\nhis companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse\nwho came in from every quarter of the country, bringing with them, for\nthe most part, the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power.\"Our council,\" said Claverhouse, \"being resolved, I suppose, to testify\nby their present exultation the extent of their former terror, have\ndecreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives; but as\nI do not quite approve the taste of it, I am willing to avoid my own part\nin the show, and, at the same time, to save you from yours.\"So saying, he gave up the command of the forces to Allan, (now a\nLieutenant-colonel,) and, turning his horse into a by-lane, rode into the\ncity privately, accompanied by Morton and two or three servants.When\nClaverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the\nCanongate, he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment, with an\nintimation, that his parole confined him to it for the present.After about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange\nvicissitudes of his late life, the attention of Morton was summoned to\nthe window by a great noise in the street beneath.Trumpets, drums, and\nkettle-drums, contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble,\nand apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal\nattitude which Claverhouse had mentioned.The magistrates of the city,\nattended by their guard of halberds, had met the victors with their\nwelcome at the gate of the city, and now preceded them as a part of the\nprocession.The next object was two heads borne upon pikes; and before\neach bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers,\nwhich were, by the brutal mockery of those who bore them, often\napproached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or\nprayer.These bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at\nBothwell Bridge.After them came a cart led by the executioner's\nassistant, in which were placed Macbriar, and other two prisoners, who\nseemed of the same profession.They were bareheaded, and strongly bound,\nyet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay, and\nappeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions, of\nwhich the bloody evidences were carried before them, or by dread of their\nown approaching execution, which these preliminaries so plainly\nindicated.Behind these prisoners, thus held up to public infamy and derision, came\na body of horse, brandishing their broadswords, and filling the wide\nstreet with acclamations, which were answered by the tumultuous outcries\nand shouts of the rabble, who, in every considerable town, are too happy\nin being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them\ntogether.In the rear of these troopers came the main body of the\nprisoners, at the head of whom were some of their leaders, who were\ntreated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult.Several\nwere placed on horseback with their faces to the animal's tail; others\nwere chained to long bars of iron, which they were obliged to support in\ntheir hands, like the galleyslaves in Spain when travelling to the port\nwhere they are to be put on shipboard.The heads of others who had fallen\nwere borne in triumph before the survivors, some on pikes and halberds,\nsome in sacks, bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on\nthe outside.Such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession, who\nseemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of\nthe condemned heretics in an auto-da-fe.[Note: David Hackston of\nRathillet, who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of\nAir's-Moss, in which the celebrated Cameron fell, was, on entering\nEdinburgh, \"by order of the Council, received by the Magistrates at the\nWatergate, and set on a horse's bare back with his face to the tail, and\nthe other three laid on a goad of iron, and carried up the street, Mr\nCameron's head being on a halberd before them.\"]Behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds,\nsome retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause\nfor which they suffered captivity, and were about to give a still more\nbloody testimony; others seemed pale, dispirited, dejected, questioning\nin their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which Providence\nseemed to have disowned, and looking about for some avenue through which\nthey might escape from the consequences of their rashness.Others there\nwere who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject, or of\nentertaining either hope, confidence, or fear, but who, foaming with\nthirst and fatigue, stumbled along like over-driven oxen, lost to every\nthing but their present sense of wretchedness, and without having any\ndistinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture.These unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers, and behind\nthem came the main body of the cavalry, whose military music resounded\nback from the high houses on each side of the street, and mingled with\ntheir own songs of jubilee and triumph, and the wild shouts of the\nrabble.Morton felt himself heart-sick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle,\nand recognised in the bloody heads, and still more miserable and agonized\nfeatures of the living sufferers, faces which had been familiar to him\nduring the brief insurrection.He sunk down in a chair in a bewildered\nand stupified state, from which he was awakened by the voice of Cuddie.said the poor fellow, his teeth chattering like a\npair of nut-crackers, his hair erect like boar's bristles, and his face\nas pale as that of a corpse--\"Lord forgie us, sir!we maun instantly gang\nbefore the Council!--O Lord, what made them send for a puir bodie like\nme, sae mony braw lords and gentles!--and there's my mither come on the\nlang tramp frae Glasgow to see to gar me testify, as she ca's it, that is\nto say, confess and be hanged; but deil tak me if they mak sic a guse o'\nCuddie, if I can do better.But here's Claverhouse himsell--the Lord\npreserve and forgie us, I say anes mair!\"\"You must immediately attend the Council Mr Morton,\" said Claverhouse,\nwho entered while Cuddie spoke, \"and your servant must go with you.You\nneed be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself\npersonally.But I warn you that you will see something that will give you\nmuch pain, and from which I would willingly have saved you, if I had\npossessed the power.It will be readily supposed that Morton did not venture to dispute this\ninvitation, however unpleasant.\"I must apprise you,\" said the latter, as he led the way down stairs,\n\"that you will get off cheap; and so will your servant, provided he can\nkeep his tongue quiet.\"Cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy.\"Deil a fear o' me,\" said he, \"an my mither disna pit her finger in the\npie.\"At that moment his shoulder was seized by old Mause, who had contrived to\nthrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment.said she to Cuddie, hanging upon his neck, \"glad and\nproud, and sorry and humbled am I, a'in ane and the same instant, to see\nmy bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in\ncouncil, as he did with his weapon in the field!\"\"Whisht, whisht, mither!\"\"Odd, ye daft wife,\nis this a time to speak o' thae things?I tell ye I'll testify naething\neither ae gate or another.I hae spoken to Mr Poundtext, and I'll tak the\ndeclaration, or whate'er they ca'it, and we're a' to win free off if we\ndo that--he's gotten life for himsell and a' his folk, and that's a\nminister for my siller; I like nane o' your sermons that end in a psalm\nat the Grassmarket.\"[Note: Then the place of public execution.]<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.\"O, Cuddie, man, laith wad I be they suld hurt ye,\" said old Mause,\ndivided grievously between the safety of her son's soul and that of his\nbody; \"but mind, my bonny bairn, ye hae battled for the faith, and dinna\nlet the dread o' losing creature-comforts withdraw ye frae the gude\nfight.\"\"Hout tout, mither,\" replied Cuddie, \"I hae fought e'en ower muckle\nalready, and, to speak plain, I'm wearied o'the trade.I hae swaggered\nwi' a' thae arms, and muskets, and pistols, buffcoats, and bandoliers,\nlang eneugh, and I like the pleughpaidle a hantle better.I ken naething\nsuld gar a man fight, (that's to say, when he's no angry,) by and\nout-taken the dread o'being hanged or killed if he turns back.\"\"But, my dear Cuddie,\" continued the persevering Mause, \"your bridal\ngarment--Oh, hinny, dinna sully the marriage garment!\"\"Awa, awa, mither,\" replied.Cuddie; \"dinna ye see the folks waiting for\nme?--Never fear me--I ken how to turn this far better than ye do--for\nye're bleezing awa about marriage, and the job is how we are to win by\nhanging.\"So saying, he extricated himself out of his mother's embraces, and\nrequested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place\nof examination without delay.He had been already preceded by Claverhouse\nand Morton.The Privy Council of Scotland, in whom the practice since the union of\nthe crowns vested great judicial powers, as well as the general\nsuperintendence of the executive department, was met in the ancient dark\nGothic room, adjoining to the House of Parliament in Edinburgh, when\nGeneral Grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the\ncouncil table.\"You have brought us a leash of game to-day, General,\" said a nobleman of\nhigh place amongst them.\"Here is a craven to confess--a cock of the game\nto stand at bay--and what shall I call the third, General?\"\"Without further metaphor, I will entreat your Grace to call him a person\nin whom I am specially interested,\" replied Claverhouse.said the nobleman, lolling out a tongue\nwhich was at all times too big for his mouth, and accommodating his\ncoarse features to a sneer, to which they seemed to be familiar.\"Yes, please your Grace, a whig; as your Grace was in 1641,\" replied\nClaverhouse, with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.\"He has you there, I think, my Lord Duke,\" said one of the Privy\nCouncillors.\"Ay, ay,\" returned the Duke, laughing, \"there's no speaking to him since\nDrumclog--but come, bring in the prisoners--and do you, Mr Clerk, read\nthe record.\"The clerk read forth a bond, in which General Grahame of Claverhouse and\nLord Evandale entered themselves securities, that Henry Morton, younger\nof Milnwood, should go abroad and remain in foreign parts, until his\nMajesty's pleasure was further known, in respect of the said Henry\nMorton's accession to the late rebellion, and that under penalty of life\nand limb to the said Henry Morton, and of ten thousand marks to each of\nhis securities.\"Do you accept of the King's mercy upon these terms, Mr Morton?\"said the\nDuke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council.\"I have no other choice, my lord,\" replied Morton.Morton did so without reply, conscious that, in the circumstances of his\ncase, it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily.Macbriar,\nwho was at the same instant brought to the foot of the council-table,\nbound upon a chair, for his weakness prevented him from standing, beheld\nMorton in the act of what he accounted apostasy.\"He hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant!\"he exclaimed, with a deep groan--\"A fallen star!--a fallen star!\"\"Hold your peace, sir,\" said the Duke, \"and keep your ain breath to cool\nyour ain porridge--ye'll find them scalding hot, I promise you.--Call in\nthe other fellow, who has some common sense.One sheep will leap the\nditch when another goes first.\"Cuddie was introduced unbound, but under the guard of two halberdiers,\nand placed beside Macbriar at the foot of the table.The poor fellow cast\na piteous look around him, in which were mingled awe for the great men in\nwhose presence he stood, and compassion for his fellow-sufferers, with no\nsmall fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself.He\nmade his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence, and then\nawaited the opening of the awful scene.\"Were you at the battle of Bothwell Brigg?\"was the first question which\nwas thundered in his ears.Cuddie meditated a denial, but had sense enough, upon reflection, to\ndiscover that the truth would be too strong for him; so he replied, with\ntrue Caledonian indirectness of response, \"I'll no say but it may be\npossible that I might hae been there.\"\"Answer directly, you knave--yes, or no?--You know you were there.\"\"It's no for me to contradict your Lordship's Grace's honour,\" said\nCuddie.\"Once more, sir, were you there?--yes, or no?\"\"Dear stir,\" again replied Cuddie, \"how can ane mind preceesely where\nthey hae been a' the days o' their life?\"\"Speak out, you scoundrel,\" said General Dalzell, \"or I'll dash your\nteeth out with my dudgeonhaft!--Do you think we can stand here all day to\nbe turning and dodging with you, like greyhounds after a hare?\"[Note:\nThe General is said to have struck one of the captive whigs, when under\nexamination, with the hilt of his sabre, so that the blood gushed out.The provocation for this unmanly violence was, that the prisoner had\ncalled the fierce veteran \"a Muscovy beast, who used to roast men.\"Dalzell had been long in the Russian service, which in those days was no\nschool of humanity.]\"Aweel, then,\" said Cuddie, \"since naething else will please ye, write\ndown that I cannot deny but I was there.\"\"Well, sir,\" said the Duke, \"and do you think that the rising upon that\noccasion was rebellion or not?\"\"I'm no just free to gie my opinion, stir,\" said the cautious captive,\n\"on what might cost my neck; but I doubt it will be very little better.\"\"Just than rebellion, as your honour ca's it,\" replied Cuddie.\"Well, sir, that's speaking to the purpose,\" replied his Grace.\"And are\nyou content to accept of the King's pardon for your guilt as a rebel, and\nto keep the church, and pray for the King?\"\"Blithely, stir,\" answered the unscrupulous Cuddie; \"and drink his health\ninto the bargain, when the ale's gude.\"\"Egad,\" said the Duke, \"this is a hearty cock.--What brought you into\nsuch a scrape, mine honest friend?\"\"Just ill example, stir,\" replied the prisoner, \"and a daft auld jaud of\na mither, wi' reverence to your Grace's honour.\"\"Why, God-a-mercy, my friend,\" replied the Duke, \"take care of bad advice\nanother time; I think you are not likely to commit treason on your own\nscore.--Make out his free pardon, and bring forward the rogue in the\nchair.\"Macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination.\"Were you at the battle of Bothwell Bridge?\"was, in like manner,\ndemanded of him.\"I was,\" answered the prisoner, in a bold and resolute tone.\"I was not--I went in my calling as a preacher of God's word, to\nencourage them that drew the sword in His cause.\"\"In other words, to aid and abet the rebels?\"\"Thou hast spoken it,\" replied the prisoner.\"Well, then,\" continued the interrogator, \"let us know if you saw John\nBalfour of Burley among the party?--I presume you know him?\"\"I bless God that I do know him,\" replied Macbriar; \"he is a zealous and\na sincere Christian.\"\"And when and where did you last see this pious personage?\"\"I am here to answer for myself,\" said Macbriar, in the same dauntless\nmanner, \"and not to endanger others.\"\"We shall know,\" said Dalzell, \"how to make you find your tongue.\"\"If you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle,\" answered\nLauderdale, \"he will find it without you.--Come, laddie, speak while the\nplay is good--you're too young to bear the burden will be laid on you\nelse.\"\"I defy you,\" retorted Macbriar.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\"This has not been the first of my\nimprisonments or of my sufferings; and, young as I may be, I have lived\nlong enough to know how to die when I am called upon.\"\"Ay, but there are some things which must go before an easy death, if you\ncontinue obstinate,\" said Lauderdale, and rung a small silver bell which\nwas placed before him on the table.A dark crimson curtain, which covered a sort of niche, or Gothic recess\nin the wall, rose at the signal, and displayed the public executioner, a\ntall, grim, and hideous man, having an oaken table before him, on which\nlay thumb-screws, and an iron case, called the Scottish boot, used in\nthose tyrannical days to torture accused persons.Morton, who was\nunprepared for this ghastly apparition, started when the curtain arose,\nbut Macbriar's nerves were more firm.He gazed upon the horrible\napparatus with much composure; and if a touch of nature called the blood\nfrom his cheek for a second, resolution sent it back to his brow with\ngreater energy.said Lauderdale, in a low, stern voice,\nalmost sinking into a whisper.\"He is, I suppose,\" replied Macbriar, \"the infamous executioner of your\nbloodthirsty commands upon the persons of God's people.He and you are\nequally beneath my regard; and, I bless God, I no more fear what he can\ninflict than what you can command.Flesh and blood may shrink under the\nsufferings you can doom me to, and poor frail nature may shed tears, or\nsend forth cries; but I trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of\nages.\"\"Do your duty,\" said the Duke to the executioner.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.The fellow advanced, and asked, with a harsh and discordant voice, upon\nwhich of the prisoner's limbs he should first employ his engine.\"Let him choose for himself,\" said the Duke; \"I should like to oblige him\nin any thing that is reasonable.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.\"Since you leave it to me,\" said the prisoner, stretching forth his right\nleg, \"take the best--I willingly bestow it in the cause for which I\nsuffer.\"[Note: This was the reply actually made by James Mitchell when\nsubjected to the torture of the boot, for an attempt to assassinate\nArchbishop Sharpe.]The executioner, with the help of his assistants, enclosed the leg and\nknee within the tight iron boot, or case, and then placing a wedge of the\nsame metal between the knee and the edge of the machine, took a mallet in\nhis hand, and stood waiting for farther orders.A well-dressed man, by\nprofession a surgeon, placed himself by the other side of the prisoner's\nchair, bared the prisoner's arm, and applied his thumb to the pulse in\norder to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient.When these preparations were made, the President of the Council repeated\nwith the same stern voice the question, \"When and where did you last see\nJohn Balfour of Burley?\"The prisoner, instead of replying to him, turned his eyes to heaven as if\nimploring Divine strength, and muttered a few words, of which the last\nwere distinctly audible, \"Thou hast said thy people shall be willing in\nthe day of thy power!\"The Duke of Lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to\ncollect their suffrages, and, judging from their mute signs, gave on his\nown part a nod to the executioner, whose mallet instantly descended on\nthe wedge, and, forcing it between the knee and the iron boot, occasioned\nthe most exquisite pain, as was evident from the flush which instantly\ntook place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer.The fellow then\nagain raised his weapon, and stood prepared to give a second blow.\"Will you yet say,\" repeated the Duke of Lauderdale, \"where and when you\nlast parted from Balfour of Burley?\"\"You have my answer,\" said the sufferer resolutely, and the second blow\nfell.The third and fourth succeeded; but at the fifth, when a larger\nwedge had been introduced, the prisoner set up a scream of agony.Morton, whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty, could\nbear no longer, and, although unarmed and himself in great danger, was\nspringing forward, when Claverhouse, who observed his emotion, withheld\nhim by force, laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth,\nwhile he whispered, \"For God's sake, think where you are!\"This movement, fortunately for him, was observed by no other of the\ncouncillors, whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before\nthem.\"He is gone,\" said the surgeon--\"he has fainted, my Lords, and human\nnature can endure no more.\"\"Release him,\" said the Duke; and added, turning to Dalzell, \"He will\nmake an old proverb good, for he'll scarce ride to-day, though he has had\nhis boots on.\"Ay, dispatch his sentence, and have done with him; we have plenty of\ndrudgery behind.\"Strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of\nthe unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a\nreturn of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a\ntraitor taken in the act of open rebellion, and adjudged him to be\ncarried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged\nby the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and\ndisposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure\nof the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage\nas the rest of their conduct.The heads of the preachers were frequently\nexposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the\nattitude of prayer.When the celebrated Richard Cameron's head was\nexposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one\nwho lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.]and all\nand sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his\nMajesty's use.\"Doomster,\" he continued, \"repeat the sentence to the prisoner.\"The office of Doomster was in those days, and till a much later period,\nheld by the executioner in commendam, with his ordinary functions.[Note:\nSee a note on the subject of this office in the Heart of Mid-Lothian.]The duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of\nthe law as pronounced by the judge, which acquired an additional and\nhorrid emphasis from the recollection, that the hateful personage by whom\nit was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced.Macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first\npronounced by the Lord President of the Council; but he was sufficiently\nrecovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the\nharsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it, and at the\nlast awful words, \"And this I pronounce for doom,\" he answered boldly--\n\"My Lords, I thank you for the only favour I looked for, or would accept\nat your hands, namely, that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass,\nwhich has this day sustained your cruelty, to this hasty end.It were\nindeed little to me whether I perish on the gallows or in the\nprison-house; but if death, following close on what I have this day\nsuffered, had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage, many might\nhave lost the sight how a Christian man can suffer in the good cause.For\nthe rest, I forgive you, my Lords, for what you have appointed and I have\nsustained--And why should I not?--Ye send me to a happy exchange--to the\ncompany of angels and the spirits of the just, for that of frail dust\nand ashes--Ye send me from darkness into day--from mortality to\nimmortality--and, in a word, from earth to heaven!--If the thanks,\ntherefore, and pardon of a dying man can do you good, take them at my\nhand, and may your last moments be as happy as mine!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.As he spoke thus, with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph, he was\nwithdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment, and executed\nwithin half an hour, dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his\nwhole life had evinced.The Council broke up, and Morton found himself again in the carriage with\nGeneral Grahame.\"Marvellous firmness and gallantry!\"said Morton, as he reflected upon\nMacbriar's conduct; \"what a pity it is that with such self-devotion and\nheroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.\"You mean,\" said Claverhouse, \"his resolution to condemn you to death?--\nTo that he would have reconciled himself by a single text; for example,\n'And Phinehas arose and executed judgment,' or something to the same\npurpose.--But wot ye where you are now bound, Mr Morton?\"\"We are on the road to Leith, I observe,\" answered Morton.\"Can I not be\npermitted to see my friends ere I leave my native land?\"\"Your uncle,\" replied Grahame, \"has been spoken to, and declines visiting\nyou.The good gentleman is terrified, and not without some reason, that\nthe crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and\ntenements--he sends you, however, his blessing, and a small sum of money.Major Bellenden is at\nTillietudlem putting matters in order.The scoundrels have made great\nhavoc there with Lady Margaret's muniments of antiquity, and have\ndesecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the Throne of his most\nSacred Majesty.Is there any one else whom you would wish to see?\"Morton sighed deeply as he answered, \"No--it would avail nothing.--But my\npreparations,--small as they are, some must be necessary.\"\"They are all ready for you,\" said the General.\"Lord Evandale has\nanticipated all you wish.Here is a packet from him with letters of\nrecommendation for the court of the Stadtholder Prince of Orange, to\nwhich I have added one or two.I made my first campaigns under him, and\nfirst saw fire at the battle of Seneff.Claverhouse\ngreatly distinguished himself in this action, and was made Captain.]There are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants, and more will\nbe sent when you require it.\"Morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and\nconfused look, so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment.\"He shall be taken care of, and replaced, if it be practicable, in the\nservice of Lady Margaret Bellenden; I think he will hardly neglect the\nparade of the feudal retainers, or go a-whigging a second time.--But here\nwe are upon the quay, and the boat waits you.\"A boat waited for Captain Morton, with\nthe trunks and baggage belonging to his rank.Claverhouse shook him by\nthe hand, and wished him good fortune, and a happy return to Scotland in\nquieter times.\"I shall never forget,\" he said, \"the gallantry of your behaviour to my\nfriend Evandale, in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid\nhim out of their way.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.As Morton descended the pier\nto get into the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very\nsmall space.The person who gave it seemed much muffled\nup; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the\ncrowd.The incident awakened Morton's curiosity; and when he found\nhimself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his\ncompanions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an\nopportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him.It ran\nthus:--\"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his\nenemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the\nErastian interest.These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel.--I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger.But turn from\nthat folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall\nmy hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence\nhath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of\nruin and confiscation.The resistance of their stronghold was the main\ncause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon\nmy soul to visit it upon them.Wherefore, think of her no more, but join\nwith our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this\nmiserable land to save and to relieve her.There is an honest remnant in\nHolland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance.Join thyself unto\nthem like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou\nwilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own\nworking.Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard,\nthou wilt at all times hear of my in-comings and out-goings, by enquiring\nafter Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular\nChristian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff,\nwhere Niel Blane entertaineth guests.So much from him who hopes to hear\nagain from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving\nagainst sin.Keep thy sword\ngirded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who\nshall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw,\nand malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments\ndyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house\nof Joseph for fire.I am he that hath written it, whose hand hath been on\nthe mighty in the waste field.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.This extraordinary letter was subscribed J. B. of B.; but the signature\nof these initials was not necessary for pointing out to Morton that it\ncould come from no other than Burley.It gave him new occasion to admire\nthe indomitable spirit of this man, who, with art equal to his courage\nand obstinacy, was even now endeavouring to re-establish the web of\nconspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces.But he felt no sort\nof desire, in the", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "The threats which Burley held out against the family\nof Bellenden, he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account\nof their defence of Tillietudlem; and nothing seemed less likely than\nthat, at the very moment of their party being victorious, their fugitive\nand distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their\nfortunes.Morton, however, hesitated for an instant, whether he should not send\nthe Major or Lord Evandale intimation of Burley's threats.Upon\nconsideration, he thought he could not do so without betraying his\nconfidential correspondence; for to warn them of his menaces would have\nserved little purpose, unless he had given them a clew to prevent them,\nby apprehending his person; while, by doing so, he deemed he should\ncommit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed\nalmost imaginary.Upon mature consideration, therefore, he tore the\nletter, having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the\nwriter was to be heard of, and threw the fragments into the sea.While Morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored, and the white\nsails swelled out before a favourable north-west wind.The ship leaned\nher side to the gale, and went roaring through the waves, leaving a long\nand rippling furrow to track her course.The city and port from which he\nhad sailed became undistinguishable in the distance; the hills by which\nthey were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky, and Morton was\nseparated for several years from the land of his nativity.It is fortunate for tale-tellers that they are not tied down like\ntheatrical writers to the unities of time and place, but may conduct\ntheir personages to Athens and Thebes at their pleasure, and bring them\nback at their convenience.Time, to use Rosalind's simile, has hitherto\npaced with the hero of our tale; for betwixt Morton's first appearance as\na competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for Holland hardly\ntwo months elapsed.Years, however, glided away ere we find it possible\nto resume the thread of our narrative, and Time must be held to have\ngalloped over the interval.Craving, therefore, the privilege of my cast,\nI entreat the reader's attention to the continuation of the narrative, as\nit starts from a new era, being the year immediately subsequent to the\nBritish Revolution.Scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a\nchange of dynasty, and, through the prudent tolerance of King William,\nhad narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war.Agriculture\nbegan to revive, and men, whose minds had been disturbed by the violent\npolitical concussions, and the general change of government in Church and\nState, had begun to recover their ordinary temper, and to give the usual\nattention to their own private affairs, in lieu of discussing those of\nthe public.The Highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of\nthings, and were in arms in a considerable body under the Viscount of\nDundee, whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of Grahame of\nClaverhouse.But the usual state of the Highlands was so unruly that\ntheir being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the\ngeneral tranquillity of the country, so long as their disorders were\nconfined within their own frontiers.In the Lowlands, the Jacobites, now\nthe undermost party, had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open\nresistance, and were, in their turn, driven to hold private meetings, and\nform associations for mutual defence, which the government termed\ntreason, while they cried out persecution.The triumphant Whigs, while they re-established Presbytery as the\nnational religion, and assigned to the General Assemblies of the Kirk\ntheir natural influence, were very far from going the lengths which the\nCameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under\nCharles and James loudly demanded.They would listen to no proposal for\nre-establishing the Solemn League and Covenant; and those who had\nexpected to find in King William a zealous Covenanted Monarch, were\ngrievously disappointed when he intimated, with the phlegm peculiar to\nhis country, his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were\nconsistent with the safety of the State.The principles of indulgence\nthus espoused and gloried in by the Government gave great offence to the\nmore violent party, who condemned them as diametrically contrary to\nScripture,--for which narrow-spirited doctrine they cited various texts,\nall, as it may well be supposed, detached from their context, and most of\nthem derived from the charges given to the Jews in the Old Testament\ndispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the Promised Land.They also\nmurmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in\nexercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the\nchastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of\nthe measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an\ninclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they\npositively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and\nQueen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn\nLeague--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the\nPresbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made\nrepeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had\nthey been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the\nsame consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to\nhold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased\nagainst Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections\nof the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,\ntheir numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant\nof serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,\nwhose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no\nbad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the\nRevolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and\nvehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to\ndiscourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed\none violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite\ninterest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet\nrepeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of\ntheir discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart\nfamily.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by\nthe great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a\nmoderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the\nformer oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having\nexercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued\nby Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately\nsubsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and\nhaving the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding\ndescent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle\nand the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods\nto sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell\nBridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,\nonce the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as\nthe surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in\nromantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence\nof the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften\nitself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by\ndetached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of\nflourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the\nabode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which\nwas covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up\nto this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation\nof a porter's lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in\nScotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes\nwere mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock\nhard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him\nbefore the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated\nthat the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended\nfrom the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green\ntrees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about\nfive years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain\nof the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old\noak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring\nto know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,\nhardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart\non her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering \"What's\nyour wull?\"which is usually a peasant's first answer, if it can be\ncalled one, to all questions whatever.\"I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.\"\"Mammie, mammie,\" exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door\nof the hut, \"come out and speak to the gentleman.\"Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,\noriginally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that\ndecent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant's wife of\nScotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed\ndown her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder\ngirl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as\nsoon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to\nlook at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful\nbreeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything\nresembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then\nreplied, \"I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called\nCuthbert Headrigg.\"It's my gudeman, sir,\" said the young woman, with a smile of welcome.\"Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,\nCuddie,\"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the\nhut--\"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye'll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he's\ndown at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu' o' bread and cheese, or a drink o' ale, till\nour gudeman comes.It's gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews\nit; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their\nhearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o' maut to the\nbrowst.\"As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader's old\nacquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still\npresented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,\nwhich indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked\non the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his\ndaughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,\n\"What's your wull wi' me, sir?\"\"I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country,\" said the\ntraveller, \"and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can\nanswer them.\"\"Nae doubt, sir,\" said Cuddie, after a moment's hesitation.\"But I would\nfirst like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony\nquestions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend\na', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a' thing about them.My mother gar 'd\nme learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to\nlearn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and\nwhiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o' them; and when I cam\nto man's yestate, cam another kind o' questioning in fashion that I liked\nwaur than Effectual Calling; and the 'did promise and vow' of the tape\nwere yokit to the end o' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear\nquestions asked befor I answer them.\"\"You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only\nrelate to the state of the country.\"replied Cuddie; \"ou, the country's weel eneugh, an it werena\nthat dour deevil, Claver'se (they ca' him Dundee now), that's stirring\nabout yet in the Highlands, they say, wi' a' the Donalds and Duncans and\nDugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi' him, to set\nthings asteer again, now we hae gotten them a' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there's little doubt o' that; he'll gie him\nhis fairing, I'll be caution for it.\"\"What makes you so positive of that, my friend?\"\"I heard it wi' my ain lugs,\" answered Cuddie, \"foretauld to him by a man\nthat had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again\njust to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca' Drumshinnel.\"\"Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life,\" said Cuddie; \"it was\nher explained it a' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very\nnames, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver'se and his dragoons.They ca'd the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he\nwas a braw preacher for a' that.\"\"You seem,\" said the stranger, \"to live in a rich and peaceful country.\"\"It's no to compleen o', sir, an we get the crap weel in,\" quoth Cuddie;\n\"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin' as fast on the tap o' that brigg\nyonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie\na spectacle.\"I was waiting upon Monmouth that\nmorning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action,\" said the\nstranger.\"Then ye saw a bonny stour,\" said Cuddie, \"that sail serve me for\nfighting a' the days o' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your\nred scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.\"\"And which side were you upon, my friend?\"retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for\nsuch,--\"there's nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking\nme.\"\"I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that\noccasion as servant to Henry Morton.\"said Cuddie, in surprise, \"how came ye by that secret?No that I\nneed care a bodee about it, for the sun's on our side o' the hedge now.I\nwish my master were living to get a blink o't.\"\"He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and\na' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse\nwas ever heard o' mair.\"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a'\nbody that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye\nhad but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing\ndragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till 't!There was he\nand that sour Whigamore they ca'd Burley: if twa men could hae won a\nfield, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.\"\"You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?\"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad\nhold no communion wi' him, because o' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi' mony o' the\nPresbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could\nget nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he\nhasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae\ndriven him clean wud.\"\"And--and,\" said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--\"do you\nknow anything of Lord Evan dale?\"\"<DW37> I ken onything o' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up\nby yonder at the house, that's as gude as married to him?\"\"No, only what they ca' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It's\nno mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason\nby Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye\nsitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower\nGlasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain.\"In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few\nlarge drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard.\"The deil's in this man,\" said Cuddie to himself; \"I wish he would either\nlight aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the\nshower begin.\"But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after\nhis last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,\nrecovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked\nCuddie \"if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.\"\"She does,\" replied Cuddie, \"but in a very sma' way.They hae been a sad\nchanged family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh\nfirst and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a' the bonny barony and\nthe holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,\nthat I suld hae gotten back again, and a' for naething, as 'a body may\nsay, but just the want o' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the\nconfusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.\"\"I have heard something of this,\" said the stranger, deepening his voice\nand averting his head.\"I have some interest in the family, and would\nwillingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house\nto-night, my friend?\"\"It's but a corner of a place, sir,\" said Cuddie, \"but we'se try, rather\nthan ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi' ye,\nsir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.\"\"I am liable to a dizziness,\" said the stranger, \"but it will soon wear\noff.\"\"I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir,\" said Cuddie; \"and we'll see\nabout a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what\nwe have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has\nsae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord\nEvandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o' some sort, to the onstead.\"\"I shall be easily accommodated,\" said the stranger, as he entered the\nhouse.\"And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted,\" said Cuddie; \"I ken\nweel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane.\"Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to\nattend in the mean while to the stranger's accommodation.The officer\nentered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,\nand carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the\ncloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he\nexcused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time\ntill Cuddie's return, he entered into some chat with the children,\ncarefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his\nlandlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,\n                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, \"that\nthe horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a\nbed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the\nlike o' them could gie him.\"said the stranger, with an interrupted and\nbroken voice.\"No, stir, they're awa wi' a' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,\nand my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she's no a\nfee'd servant.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a' trust\nand management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom\nwithout their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we\nserve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a' the haill warld,\nan her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy\nMargaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she's no ill to the\npoor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit\nwi' the sowens?\"\"Never mind, lad,\" rejoined Jenny, \"ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken\nweel that ye like your brose het.\"Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at\nthis repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence\nbetwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length\nhe suddenly interrupted them by the question: \"Can you tell me when Lord\nEvandale's marriage takes place?\"\"Very soon, we expect,\" answered Jenny, before it was possible for her\nhusband to reply; \"it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o'\nauld Major Bellenden.\"said the stranger; \"I heard at Edinburgh he was\nno more.\"He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother's wife and his\nniece were turned out o' their ain house; and he had himsell sair\nborrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o' King\nJames's days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>\nto please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the\nlaw gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o'\nyears about it; and, as I said before, the major ne'er held up his head\nagain.And then cam the pitting awa o' the Stewart line; and, though he\nhad but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean\nbroke the heart o' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a'\nthat was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow'd na\nsee onybody want.\"\"He was indeed,\" said the stranger, with a faltering voice, \"an admirable\nman,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left\nwithout fortune, as well as without a protector?\"\"They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale\nlives,\" said Jenny; \"he has been a true friend in their griefs.E'en to\nthe house they live in is his lordship's; and never man, as my auld\ngudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae\nlang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.\"\"And why,\" said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,\n\"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?\"\"There was the lawsuit to be ended,\" said Jenny readily, \"forby many\nother family arrangements.\"\"Na, but,\" said Cuddie, \"there was another reason forby; for the young\nleddy--\"\n\n\"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens,\" said his wife; \"I see\nthe gentleman's far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad\nkill him a chicken in an instant.\"\"There is no occasion,\" said the stranger; \"I shall want only a glass of\nwater, and to be left alone.\"\"You'll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me,\" said Jenny, lighting\na small lantern, \"and I'll show you the way.\"Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, \"That\nthe bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into\nthe fire,\" so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading\nsome thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door\nof a small garden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an\nold-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal\nparterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,\nand lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked\npardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his\napartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but\nwhen she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk\nforward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to\nbe a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his\nshort-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently\ndrew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without\nseeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was\nprepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense\nof her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an\nindication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of\nwhich she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she\ninformed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,\non one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and\non the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin\nwainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good\nrest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, \"I doubt\nwe're ruined folk!\"returned the imperturbed\nCuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at\nanything.\"Wha d' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to\nlight here!\"\"Why, wha the muckle deil d'ye say he is?There's nae law against\nharbouring and intercommunicating now,\" said Cuddie; \"sae, Whig or Tory,\nwhat need we care wha he be?\"\"Ay, but it's ane will ding Lord Evandale's marriage ajee yet, if it's\nno the better looked to,\" said Jenny; \"it's Miss Edith's first joe, your\nain auld maister, Cuddie.\"exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, \"Crow ye that I am\nblind?\"Ay, but, Cuddie lad,\" replied Jenny, \"though ye are no blind, ye are no\nsae notice-taking as I am.\"\"Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see\nabout the man that was like our Maister Harry?\"\"I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,\nand speaking wi' a madelike voice, sae I e'en tried him wi' some tales\no lang syne; and when I spake o' the brose, ye ken, he didna just\nlaugh,--he's ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi' his\nee that I kend he took up what I said.And a' his distress is about Miss\nEdith's marriage; and I ne'er saw a man mair taen down wi' true love in\nmy days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was\nwhen she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were\ncoming against Tillietudlem wi' the rebels.--But what's the matter wi'\nthe man now?\"said Cuddie, who was again hastily\nputting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; \"am I no gaun\nup this instant to see my maister?\"\"Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate,\" said Jenny, coolly and\nresolutely.\"D 'ye think I am to be John\nTamson's man, and maistered by women a' the days o' my life?\"And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,\nCuddie, lad?\"\"I'll gar ye comprehend in the making of a\nhay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;\nand frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he's\npurposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be\nmarried, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But\nif Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before\nthe very minister wi' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I'se\nwarrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.\"\"Weel,\" replied Cuddie, \"and what's my business wi' that?If Miss Edith\nlikes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free\nto change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps\nhe had a promise frae yoursell.\"\"Halliday's a liar, and ye're naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,\nCuddie.And then for this leddy's choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a'\nthe gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o' his coat;

\"ye ken them little to think leddies o'\ntheir rank wad set up house wi' auld Ailie Wilson, when they're maist\nower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun\nfollow the camp, if she tak Morton.\"\"That wad sort ill wi' the auld leddy, to be sure,\" said Cuddie; \"she wad\nhardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.\"\"Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a' about Whig and\nTory,\" continued Jenny.\"To be sure,\" said Cuddie, \"the auld leddy's unto kittle in thae\npoints.\"\"And then, Cuddie,\" continued his helpmate, who had reserved her\nstrongest argument to the last, \"if this marriage wi' Lord Evandale is\nbroken off, what comes o' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and\nthe cow's grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be\nturned on the wide warld!\"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that\nway, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, \"Weel,\nwoman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a' this din about it?\"\"Just do naething at a',\" said Jenny.\"Never seem to ken onything about\nthis gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,\nor up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and\nsleepit in the byre or he had gane up by;

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "\"Aweel,\" said Cuddie, sighing heavily, \"I'se awa to pleugh the outfield\nthen; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o' the gate.\"\"Very right, my dear hinny,\" replied Jenny.\"Naebody has better sense than\nyou when ye crack a bit wi' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne'er do\nonything aff hand out o' your ain head.\"\"Ane wad think it's true,\" quoth Cuddie; \"for I hae aye had some carline\nor quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o' my ain.There\nwas first my mither,\" he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself\ninto bed; \"then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca' my soul my ain;\nthen my mither and her quarrelled, and pu'ed me twa ways at anes, as if\nilk ane had an end o' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the\nBaker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife,\" he murmured in\ncontinuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, \"and she's\nlike to tak the guiding o' me a' thegither.\"\"And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a' your life?\"said Jenny, as\nshe closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and\nextinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader\nthat, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by\ntheir servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny's\nutter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady\nEmily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale.\"Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?\"said Jenny,\nconfounded with this unexpected apparition.\"We want nothing but the pass-key,\" said Miss Bellenden; \"Gudyill will\nopen the windows of the little parlour.\"\"The little parlour's locked, and the lock's, spoiled,\" answered Jenny,\nwho recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the\nbedchamber of her guest.\"In the red parlour, then,\" said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front\nof the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton\nhad been conducted.\"All will be out,\" thought Jenny, \"unless I can get him smuggled out of\nthe house the back way.\"So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty.\"I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there,\" was her next\nnatural reflection.\"But then they wad hae been for asking him to\nbreakfast.what will I do?--And there's Gudyill walking in\nthe garden too!\"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; \"and\nI daurna gang in the back way till he's aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the\npurpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill's temper was\nnot improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many\npeevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what\nwas most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the\npresent occasion, all Jenny's efforts to remove him from the garden\nserved only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the\nshrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy\nKnowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily's\nservant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken\nunder his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,\nprosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who\nstood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and\nimpatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate\nmorning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the\ndoor of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was\ndesirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in\nwhich Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss\nBellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of\nreflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the\nservant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her\nfriend.Why\nexpress so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come\nto Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even\nengaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,\nI do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.\"\"Evandale was never capricious,\" answered his sister; \"I am sure he will\nsatisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold\nhim.\"\"What I chiefly fear,\" said Edith, \"is his having engaged in some of the\nplots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that\ndreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined\nthem ere now but for my uncle's death, which gave him so much additional\ntrouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply\nsensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all\nfor their restoration!\"answered Lady Emily,--\"it is a point of honour with\nEvandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the\nGuards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for\nyears; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who\nset down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be\naware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early\npredilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I\ntrust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe\nyou are the only one who can keep him so.\"\"You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with\nthe host,--'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.'\"\"I have promised,\" said Edith, in a faint voice; \"but I trust I shall not\nbe urged on the score of time.\"\"Nay,\" said Lady Emily, \"I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to\nplead his own cause.\"\"Stay, stay, for God's sake!\"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her.\"Not I, not I,\" said the young lady, making her escape; \"the third person\nmakes a silly figure on such occasions.No one had thought of his being an\nimpostor; but when the princess fixed her clear eyes on him and asked\nhim that familiar question, which he had been in the habit of hearing\nmany times a day for a great part of his life, the guilty butterman\nthought himself detected, and shook in his guilty shoes.Hastily\ndescending from his throne, he beckoned he princess into a side-chamber,\nand closing the door, besought her in moving terms not to betray him.\"Here,\" he said, \"is a bag of rubies as big as pigeon's eggs.There are\nsix thousand of them, and I 'umbly beg your 'Ighness to haccept them as\na slight token hof my hesteem, if your 'Ighness will kindly consent to\nspare a respeckable tradesman the disgrace of being hexposed.\"The princess reflected, and came to the conclusion that, after all, a\nbutterman might make as good a king as any one else; so she took the\nrubies with a gracious little nod, and departed, while all the people\nshouted, \"Hooray!\"and followed her, waving their hats and kerchiefs, to\nthe gates of the city.With her bag of rubies over her shoulder, the fair princess now pursued\nher journey, and fared forward over heath and hill, through brake and\nthrough brier.After several days she came to a deep forest, which she\nentered without hesitation, for she knew no fear.She had not gone a\nhundred paces under the arching limes, when she was met by a band of\nrobbers, who stopped her and asked what she did in their forest, and\nwhat she carried in her bag.They were fierce, black-bearded men, armed\nto the teeth with daggers, cutlasses, pistols, dirks, hangers,\nblunderbusses, and other defensive weapons; but the princess gazed\ncalmly on them, and said haughtily,--\n\n\"Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?\"[Illustration: \"It is true!\"and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of supplication.--PAGE\n195.]The robbers started back in dismay, crying, \"The\ncountersign!\"Then they hastily lowered their weapons, and assuming\nattitudes of abject humility, besought the princess graciously to\naccompany them to their master's presence.With a lofty gesture she\nsignified assent, and the cringing, trembling bandits led her on through\nthe forest till they reached an open glade, into which the sunbeams\nglanced right merrily.Here, under a broad oak-tree which stood in the\ncentre of the glade, reclined a man of gigantic stature and commanding\nmien, with a whole armory of weapons displayed upon his person.Hastening to their chief, the robbers conveyed to him, in agitated\nwhispers, the circumstance of their meeting the princess, and of her\nunexpected reply to their questions.Hardly seeming to credit their\nstatement, the gigantic chieftain sprang to his feet, and advancing\ntoward the princess with a respectful reverence, begged her to repeat\nthe remark which had so disturbed his men.With a royal air, and in\nclear and ringing tones, the princess repeated,--\n\n\"_Has_ your grandmother sold her mangle yet?\"and gazed steadfastly at\nthe robber chief.He turned deadly pale, and staggered against a tree, which alone\nprevented him from falling.The enemy is without doubt\nclose at hand, and all is over.Yet,\" he added with more firmness, and\nwith an appealing glance at the princess, \"yet there may be one chance\nleft for us.If this gracious lady will consent to go forward, instead\nof returning through the wood, we may yet escape with our lives.and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of\nsupplication, \"consider, I pray you, whether it would really add to your\nhappiness to betray to the advancing army a few poor foresters, who earn\ntheir bread by the sweat of their brow.Here,\" he continued, hastily\ndrawing something from a hole in the oak-tree, \"is a bag containing ten\nthousand sapphires, each as large as a pullet's egg.If you will\ngraciously deign to accept them, and to pursue your journey in the\ndirection I shall indicate, the Red Chief of the Rustywhanger will be\nyour slave forever.\"The princess, who of course knew that there was no army in the\nneighborhood, and who moreover did not in the least care which way she\nwent, assented to the Red Chief's proposition, and taking the bag of\nsapphires, bowed her farewell to the grateful robbers, and followed\ntheir leader down a ferny path which led to the farther end of the\nforest.When they came to the open country, the robber chieftain took\nhis leave of the princess, with profound bows and many protestations of\ndevotion, and returned to his band, who were already preparing to plunge\ninto the impenetrable thickets of the midforest.The princess, meantime, with her two bags of gems on her shoulders,\nfared forward with a light heart, by dale and by down, through moss and\nthrough meadow.By-and-by she came to a fair high palace, built all of\nmarble and shining jasper, with smooth lawns about it, and sunny gardens\nof roses and gillyflowers, from which the air blew so sweet that it was\na pleasure to breathe it.The princess stood still for a moment, to\ntaste the sweetness of this air, and to look her fill at so fair a spot;\nand as she stood there, it chanced that the palace-gates opened, and the\nyoung king rode out with his court, to go a-catching of nighthawks.Now when the king saw a right fair princess standing alone at his\npalace-gate, her rich garments dusty and travel-stained, and two heavy\nsacks hung upon her shoulders, he was filled with amazement; and leaping\nfrom his steed, like the gallant knight that he was, he besought her to\ntell him whence she came and whither she was going, and in what way he\nmight be of service to her.But the princess looked down at her little dusty shoes, and answered\nnever a word; for she had seen at the first glance how fair and goodly a\nking this was, and she would not ask him the price of butter, nor\nwhether his grandmother had sold her mangle yet.But she thought in her\nheart, \"Now, I have never, in all my life, seen a man to whom I would so\nwillingly say, 'With all my heart!'The king marvelled much at her silence, and presently repeated his\nquestions, adding, \"And what do you carry so carefully in those two\nsacks, which seem over-heavy for your delicate shoulders?\"Still holding her eyes downcast, the princess took a ruby from one bag,\nand a sapphire from the other, and in silence handed them to the king,\nfor she willed that he should know she was no beggar, even though her\nshoes were dusty.Thereat all the nobles were filled with amazement, for\nno such gems had ever been seen in that country.But the king looked steadfastly at the princess, and said, \"Rubies are\nfine, and sapphires are fair; but, maiden, if I could but see those\neyes of yours, I warrant that the gems would look pale and dull beside\nthem.\"At that the princess raised her clear dark eyes, and looked at the king\nand smiled; and the glance of her eyes pierced straight to his heart, so\nthat he fell on his knees and cried:\n\n\"Ah!sweet princess, now do I know that thou art the love for whom I\nhave waited so long, and whom I have sought through so many lands.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.Give\nme thy white hand, and tell me, either by word or by sign, that thou\nwilt be my queen and my bride!\"And the princess, like a right royal maiden as she was, looked him\nstraight in the eyes, and giving him her little white hand, answered\nbravely, \"_With all my heart!_\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.NOW, if we had looked into the hermit's cave a few days after this, we\nshould have seen a very pleasant sight.The good old man was sitting up\non his narrow couch, with his lame leg on a stool before him.On another\nstool sat our worthy friend Bruin, with a backgammon-board on his knees,\nand the two were deep in the mysteries of Russian backgammon.\"Dear, dear, what luck you do have!\"\"Yes,\" said the hermit, \"this finishes the game and the rubber.But just\nremember, my friend, how you beat me yesterday.I was gammoned over and\nover again, with never a doublet to save me from ruin.\"yesterday was one\nof my good days.And so to-day you have gammoned me back again.I\nsuppose that is why the game is called back-gammon, hey?\"\"And how have you been in the habit of playing?\"\"You spoke of playing last winter, you know.Whom did you play with, for\nexample?\"\"With myself,\" said the hermit,--\"the right hand against the left.I\ntaught my crow the game once, but it didn't work very well.He could not\nlift the dice-box, and could only throw the dice by running against the\nbox, and upsetting it.This was apt to disarrange the pieces, you see;\nand as he would not trust me to throw for him, we gave it up.\"\"And what else did you do in the way\nof amusement?\"\"I read, chiefly,\" replied the old man.\"You see I have a good many\nbooks, and they are all good ones, which will bear reading many times.\"\"That is _one_ thing about you people that I\ncannot understand,--the reading of books.Seems so senseless, you know,\nwhen you can use your eyes for other things.But, tell me,\" he added,\n\"have you never thought of trying our way of passing the winter?It is\ncertainly much the best way, when one is alone.Choose a comfortable\nplace, like this, for example, curl yourself up in the warmest corner,\nand there you are, with nothing to do but to sleep till spring comes\nagain.\"\"I am afraid I could not do that,\" said the hermit with a smile.I cannot sleep more than a few hours at a\ntime, at any season of the year.\"\"That makes\nall the difference, you know.Have you ever _tried_ sucking your paw?\"The hermit was forced to admit that he never had.well, you really must try it some day,\" said Bruin.\"There is\nnothing like it, after all.I will confess to you,\" he\nadded in a low tone, and looking cautiously about to make sure that they\nwere alone, \"that I have missed it sadly this winter.In most respects\nthis has been the happiest season of my life, and I have enjoyed it more\nthan I can tell you; but still there are times,--when I am tired, you\nknow, or the weather is dull, or <DW53> is a little trying, as he is\nsometimes,--times when I feel as if I would give a great deal for a\nquiet corner where I could suck my paw and sleep for a week or two.\"\"<DW53> thinks the Madam\nwould not like it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.He is very genteel, you know,--very genteel indeed,\n<DW53> is; and he says it wouldn't be at all 'the thing' for me to suck\nmy paw anywhere about the place.I never know just what 'thing' he means\nwhen he says that, but it's a favorite expression of his; and he\ncertainly knows a great deal about good manners.Besides,\" he added,\nmore cheerfully, \"there is always plenty of work to do, and that is the\nbest thing to keep one awake.Baldhead, it is time for your\ndinner, sir; and here am I sitting and talking, when I ought to be\nwarming your broth!\"With these words the excellent bear arose, put away the backgammon\nboard, and proceeded to build up the fire, hang the kettle, and put the\nbroth on to warm, all as deftly as if he had been a cook all his life.He stirred and tasted, shook his head, tasted again, and then said,--\n\n\"You haven't the top of a young pine-tree anywhere about the house, I\nsuppose?It would give this broth such a nice flavor.\"\"I don't generally keep a\nlarge stock of such things on hand.But I fancy the broth will be very\ngood without it, to judge from the last I had.\"\"Do you ever put frogs in your\nbroth?\"\"Whole ones, you know, rolled in a batter,\njust like dumplings?\"\"_No!_\" said the hermit, quickly and decidedly.\"I am quite sure I\nshould not like them, thank you,--though it was very kind of you to make\nthe suggestion!\"he added, seeing that Bruin looked disappointed.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.\"You have no idea how nice they are,\" said the good bear, rather sadly.I never could induce Toto or Madam\nto try them, either.I invented the soup myself,--at least the\nfrog-dumpling part of it,--and made it one day as a little surprise for\nthem.But when I told them what the dumplings were, Toto choked and\nrolled on the floor, and Madam was quite ill at the very thought, though\nshe had not begun to eat her soup.So <DW53> and Cracker and I had it all\nto ourselves, and uncommonly good it was.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.It's a pity for people to be\nso prejudiced.\"The good hermit was choking a little himself, for some reason or other,\nbut he looked very grave when Bruin turned toward him for assent, and\nsaid, \"Quite so!\"The broth being now ready, the bear proceeded to arrange a tray neatly,\nand set it before his patient, who took up his wooden spoon and fell to\nwith right good-will.The good bear stood watching him with great\nsatisfaction; and it was really a pity that there was no one there to\nwatch the bear himself, for as he stood there with a clean cloth over\nhis arm, his head on one side, and his honest face beaming with pride\nand pleasure, he was very well worth looking at.At this moment a sharp cry of terror was heard outside, then a quick\nwhirr of wings, and the next moment the wood-pigeon darted into the\ncave, closely pursued by a large hawk.She was quite\nexhausted, and with one more piteous cry she fell fainting at Bruin's\nfeet.In another instant the hawk would have pounced upon her, but that\ninstant never came for the winged marauder.Instead, something or\nsomebody pounced on _him_.A thick white covering enveloped him,\nentangling his claws, binding down his wings, well-nigh stifling him.He\nfelt himself seized in an iron grasp and lifted bodily into the air,\nwhile a deep, stern voice exclaimed,--\n\n\"Now, sir!have you anything to say for yourself, before I wring your\nneck?\"Then the covering was drawn back from his head, and he found himself\nface to face with the great bear, whom he knew perfectly well by sight.But he was a bold fellow, too well used to danger to shrink from it,\neven in so terrible a form as this; and his fierce yellow eyes met the\nstern gaze of his captor without shrinking.repeated the bear, \"before I wring your ugly\nneck?\"replied the hawk, sullenly, \"wring away.\"This answer rather disconcerted our friend Bruin, who, as he sometimes\nsaid sadly to himself, had \"lost all taste for killing;\" so he only\nshook Master Hawk a little, and said,--\n\n\"Do you know of any reason why your neck should _not_ be wrung?\"Are you\nafraid, you great clumsy monster?\"\"I'll soon show you whether I am afraid or not!\"\"If _you_ had had\nnothing to eat for a week, you'd have eaten her long before this, I'll\nbe bound!\"Here Bruin began to rub his nose with his disengaged paw, and to look\nhelplessly about him, as he always did when disturbed in mind.he exclaimed, \"you hawk, what do you mean by that?\"It _is_ rather short,\" said Bruin; \"but--yes!why, of course, _any one_\ncan dig, if he wants to.\"\"Ask that old thing,\" said the hawk, nodding toward the hermit, \"whether\n_he_ ever dug with his beak; and it's twice as long as mine.\"replied Bruin, promptly; but then he faltered, for\nit suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen either Toto or the\nMadam dig with their noses; and it was with some hesitation that he\nasked:\n\n\"Mr.but--a--have you ever tried digging for roots\nin the ground--with your beak--I mean, nose?\"The hermit looked up gravely, as he sat with Pigeon Pretty on his knee.\"No, my friend,\" he said with great seriousness, \"I have never tried\nit, and doubt if I could do it.I can dig with my hands, though,\" he\nadded, seeing the good bear look more and more puzzled.\"But you see this bird has no hands, though he\nhas very ugly claws; so that doesn't help-- Well!\"he cried, breaking\noff short, and once more addressing the hawk.\"I don't see anything for\nit _but_ to wring your neck, do you?After all, it will keep you from\nbeing hungry again.\"But here the soft voice of the wood-pigeon interposed.Bruin,\ndear,\" cried the gentle bird.\"Give him something to eat, and let him\ngo.If he had eaten nothing for a week, I am sure he was not to blame\nfor pursuing the first eatable creature he saw.Remember,\" she added in\na lower tone, which only the bear could hear, \"that before this winter,\nany of us would have done the same.\"Bruin scratched his head helplessly; the hawk turned his yellow eyes on\nPigeon Pretty with a strange look, but said nothing.But now the hermit\nsaw that it was time for him to interfere.\"Pigeon Pretty,\" he said, \"you are right, as usual.Bruin, my friend,\nbring your prisoner here, and let him finish this excellent broth, into\nwhich I have crumbled some bread.I will answer for Master Hawk's good\nbehavior, for the present at least,\" he added, \"for I know that he comes\nof an old and honorable family.\"In five minutes the hawk was sitting quietly on the\nhermit's knee, sipping broth, pursuing the floating bits of bread in the\nbowl, and submitting to have his soft black plumage stroked, with the\nbest grace in the world.On the good man's other knee sat Pigeon Pretty,\nnow quite recovered from her fright and fatigue, her soft eyes beaming\nwith pleasure; while Bruin squatted opposite them, looking from one to\nthe other, and assuring himself over and over again that Pigeon Pretty\nwas \"a most astonishing bird!'pon my word, a _most_ astonishing bird!\"His meal ended, the stranger wiped his beak politely on his feathers,\nplumed himself, and thanked his hosts for their hospitality, with a\nstately courtesy which contrasted strangely with his former sullen and\nferocious bearing.The fierce glare was gone from his eyes, which were,\nhowever, still strangely bright; and with his glossy plumage smooth, and\nhis head held proudly erect, he really was a noble-looking bird.\"Long is it, indeed,\" he said, \"since any one has spoken a kind word to\nGer-Falcon.It will not be forgotten, I assure you.We are a wild and\nlawless family,--our beak against every one, and every one's claw\nagainst us,--and yet, as you observed, Sir Baldhead, we are an old and\nhonorable race.for the brave, brave days of old, when my sires\nwere the honored companions of kings and princes!My grandfather seventy\ntimes removed was served by an emperor, the obsequious monarch carrying\nhim every day on his own wrist to the hunting.He ate from a golden\ndish, and wore a collar of gems about his neck.what would be\nthe feelings of that noble ancestor if he could see his descendant a\nhunted outlaw, persecuted by the sons of those very men who once courted\nand caressed him, and supporting a precarious existence by the ignoble\nspoils of barn-yards and hen-roosts!\"The hawk paused, overcome by these recollections of past glory, and the\ngood bear said kindly,--\n\n\"Dear!And how did this melancholy change come\nabout, pray?\"replied the hawk, \"ignoble fashion!The race of\nmen degenerated, and occupied themselves with less lofty sports than\nhawking.My family, left to themselves, knew not what to do.They had\nbeen trained to pursue, to overtake, to slay, through long generations;\nthey were unfitted for anything else.But when they began to lead this\nlife on their own account, man, always ungrateful, turned upon them, and\npersecuted them for the very deeds which had once been the delight and\npride of his fickle race.So we fell from our high estate, lower and\nlower, till the present representative of the Ger-Falcon is the poor\ncreature you behold before you.\"The hawk bowed in proud humility, and his hearers all felt, perhaps,\nmuch more sorry for him than he deserved.The wood-pigeon was about to\nask something more about his famous ancestors, when a shadow darkened\nthe mouth of the cave, and Toto made his appearance, with the crow\nperched on his shoulder.he cried in his fresh, cheery voice, \"how are you\nto-day, sir?And catching sight of the stranger, he stopped short, and looked at the\nbear for an explanation.Ger-Falcon, Toto,\" said Bruin.Toto nodded, and the hawk made him a stately bow; but the two\nlooked distrustfully at each other, and neither seemed inclined to make\nany advances.Falcon came here in a--well, not in a friendly way at all, I must\nsay.But he is in a very different frame of mind, now, and I trust there\nwill be no further trouble.\"asked Toto, abruptly, addressing\nthe hawk.\"I have\nno reason to be ashamed of my name.\"\"And yet I am tolerably sure that Mr.Chicken Hawkon, and that it was he who\ntried to carry off my Black Spanish chickens yesterday morning.\"I was\nstarving, and the chickens presented themselves to me wholly in the\nlight of food.May I ask for what purpose you keep chickens, sir?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"Why, we eat them when they grow up,\" said Toto; \"but--\"\n\n\"Ah, precisely!\"\"But we don't steal other people's chickens,\" said the boy, \"we eat our\nown.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.\"You eat the tame, confiding\ncreatures who feed from your hand, and stretch their necks trustfully to\nmeet their doom.I, on the contrary, when the pangs of hunger force me\nto snatch a morsel of food to save me from starvation, snatch it from\nstrangers, not from my friends.\"Toto was about to make a hasty reply, but the bear, with a motion of his\npaw, checked him, and said gravely to the hawk,--\n\n\"Come, come!Falcon, I cannot have any dispute of this kind.There\nis some truth in what you say, and I have no doubt that emperors and\nother disreputable people have had a large share in forming the bad\nhabits into which you and all your family have fallen.But those habits\nmust be changed, sir, if you intend to remain in this forest.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.You must\nnot meddle with Toto's chickens; you must not chase quiet and harmless\nbirds.You must, in short, become a respectable and law-abiding bird,\ninstead of a robber and a murderer.\"I\ncan be'respectable,' as you call it, in summer; but in weather like\nthis--\"\n\n\"That can be easily managed,\" said the kind hermit.I shall soon be able to shift for myself, and I will gladly\nundertake to feed you until the snow and frost are gone.You will be a\ncompanion for my crow-- By the way, where is my crow?Surely he came in\nwith you, Toto?\"\"He did,\" said Toto, \"but he hopped off the moment we entered.Didn't\nlike the looks of the visitor, I fancy,\" he added in a low tone.Search was made, and finally the crow was discovered huddled together, a\ndisconsolate little bunch of black feathers, in the darkest corner of\nthe cave.cried Toto, who was the first to catch sight of him.Why are you rumpling and humping yourself up in that\nabsurd fashion?\"asked the crow, opening one eye a very little way, and\nlifting his head a fraction of an inch from the mass of feathers in\nwhich it was buried.\"Good Toto, kind Toto, is he gone?I would not be\neaten to-day, Toto, if it could be avoided.\"If you mean the hawk,\" said Toto, \"he is _not_ gone; and what is more,\nhe isn't going, for your master has asked him to stay the rest of the\nwinter.Bruin has bound him\nover to keep the peace, and you must come out and make the best of it.\"The unhappy crow begged and protested, but all in vain.Toto caught him\nup, laughing, and carried him to his master, who set him on his knee,\nand smoothed his rumpled plumage kindly.The hawk, who was highly\ngratified by the hermit's invitation, put on his most gracious manner,\nand soon convinced the crow that he meant him no harm.\"A member of the ancient family of Corvus!\"\"Contemporaries, and probably friends, of the early Falcons.Let us also\nbe friends, dear sir;

and now a cold shiver passed\nover her as he fixed his spectacled eyes on her and listened in silence\nto the confused accounts which her father and mother poured into his\near.Let me see the jew'ls, as ye call thim.\"The pearls and diamonds were brought,--a whole handful of them,--and\npoured into the doctor's hand, which closed suddenly over them, while\nhis dull black eyes shot out a quick gleam under the shading spectacles.The next moment, however, he laughed good-humoredly and turned them\ncarelessly over one by one.\"Why, Dinnis,\" he said, \"'tis aisy to see that ye've not had mich\nexpeerunce o' jew'ls, me bye, or ye'd not mistake these bits o' glass\nan' sich fer thim.there's no jew'ls here, wheriver the\nCountess's are.An' these bits o' trash dhrop out o' the choild's mouth,\nye till me, ivery toime she shpakes?\"\"Out they dhrops, an' goes hoppin'\nan' leppin' about the room, loike they were aloive.\"This is a very sirrious case,\nMisther Macarthy,--a very sirrious case _in_dade, sirr;

but not until they were well out of\nsight and hearing of her parents.\"Now, Eileen,\" he said, not unkindly, \"av ye'll be a good colleen, and\nnot shpake a wurrd, I'll lave yer mouth free.But av ye shpake, so much\nas to say, 'Bliss ye!'I'll tie up yer jaw wid me pock'-handkercher, so\nas ye can't open ut at all.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.She had not the slightest desire to say \"Bliss\nye!\"O'Shaughnessy; nor did she care to fill his rusty old gig,\nor to sprinkle the high road, with diamonds and pearls.said the Doctor, \"that's a sinsible gyurrl as ye are.See, now, what a foine bit o' sweet-cake Misthress O'Shaughnessy 'ull be\ngivin' ye, whin we git home.\"The poor child burst into tears, for the word 'home' made her realize\nmore fully that she was going every moment farther and farther away from\nher own home,--from her kind father, her anxious and loving mother, and\ndear little Phelim.What would Phelim do at night, without her shoulder\nto curl up on and go to sleep, in the trundle-bed which they had shared\never since he was a tiny baby?Who would light her father's pipe, and\nsing him the little song he always liked to hear while he smoked it\nafter supper?These, and many other such thoughts, filled Eileen's mind\nas she sat weeping silently beside the green-spectacled doctor, who\ncared nothing about her crying, so long as she did not try to speak.After a drive of some miles, they reached a tall, dark, gloomy-looking\nhouse, which was not unlike the doctor himself, with its small greenish\nwindow-panes and its gaunt chimneys.Here the pony stopped, and the\ndoctor, lifting Eileen out of the gig, carried her into the house.O'Shaughnessy came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron,\nand stared in amazement at the burden in her husband's arms.Is she\nkilt, or what's the matther?\"\"Open the door o' the best room!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.\"Open it,\nwoman, I'm tillin' ye!\"and entering a large bare room, he set Eileen\ndown hastily on a stool, and then drew a long breath and wiped his brow.\"Safe and sound I've got ye now, glory for ut!And ye'll not lave this room until ye've made me _King av Ireland_!\"Eileen stared at the man, thinking he had gone mad; for his face was\nred, and his eyes, from which he had snatched the green spectacles,\nglittered with a strange light.The same idea flashed into his wife's\nmind, and she crossed herself devoutly, exclaiming,--\n\n\"Howly St.Pathrick, he's clane diminted.he said; \"ye'll soon see\nav I'm diminted.I till ye I'll be King av Ireland before the month's\noot.Open yer mouth, alanna, and make yer manners\nto Misthress O'Shaughnessy.\"Thus adjured, Eileen dropped a courtesy, and said, timidly, \"Good day t'\nye, Ma'm!down dropped a pearl and a diamond, and the doctor, pouncing\non them, held them up in triumph before the eyes of his astonished wife.There's no sich in Queen\nVictory's crownd this day.That's a pearrl, an' as big\nas a marrowfat pay.The loike of ut's not in Ireland, I till ye.Woman,\nthere's a fortin' in ivery wurrd this colleen shpakes!And she's goin'\nto shpake,\" he added, grimly, \"and to kape an shpakin', till Michael\nO'Shaughnessy is rich enough to buy all Ireland,--ay, and England too,\nav he'd a mind to!\"O'Shaughnessy, utterly bewildered by her\nhusband's wild talk, and by the sight of the jewels, \"what does it all\nmane?Has the choild swallied 'em?And won't she die av 'em, av it's\nthat manny in her stumick?\"\"Swallied\n'em, indade!The gyurrl has met a Grane Man, that's the truth of ut;

and ye'll kape an talkin' till the room is _full-up_!\"No less'll satisfy me, and it's the\nlaste ye can do for all the throuble I've taken forr ye.Misthress\nO'Shaughnessy an' mesilf 'ull take turns sittin' wid ye, so 'at ye'll\nhave some wan to talk to.Ye'll have plinty to ate an' to dhrink, an'\nthat's more than manny people have in Ireland this day.So lit me hear\nno complainin'.\"With this, the worthy man proceeded to give strict injunctions to his\nwife to keep the child talking, and not to leave her alone for an\ninstant; and finally he departed, shutting the door behind him, and\nleaving the captive and her jailer alone together.O'Shaughnessy immediately poured forth a flood of questions, to\nwhich Eileen replied by telling the whole pitiful story from beginning\nto end.It was a relief to be able to speak at last, and to rehearse the\nwhole matter to understanding, if not sympathetic, ears.O'Shaughnessy listened and looked, looked and listened, with open mouth\nand staring eyes.With her eyes shut, she would not have believed her\nears; but the double evidence was too much for her.The diamonds and pearls kept on falling, falling, fast and faster.They\nfilled Eileen's lap, they skipped away over the floor, while the\ndoctor's wife pursued them with frantic eagerness.Each diamond was\nclear and radiant as a drop of dew, each pearl lustrous and perfect; but\nthey gave no pleasure now to the fairy-gifted child.She could only\nthink of the task that lay before her,--to FILL this great, empty room;\nof the millions and millions, and yet again millions of gems that must\nfall from her lips before the floor would be covered even a few inches\ndeep; of the weeks and months,--perhaps the years,--that must elapse\nbefore she would see her parents and Phelim again.She remembered the\nwords of the fairy: \"A day may come when you will wish with all your\nheart to have the charm removed.\"And then, like a flash, came the\nrecollection of those other words: \"When that day comes, come here to\nthis spot,\" and do so and so.In fancy, Eileen was transported again to the pleasant green forest; was\nlooking at the Green Man as he sat on the toadstool, and begging him to\ntake away this fatal gift, which had already, in one day, brought her so\nmuch misery.Harshly on her reverie broke in the voice of Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, asking,--\n\n\"And has yer father sold his pigs yit?\"She started, and came back to the doleful world of reality.But even as\nshe answered the woman's question, she made in her heart a firm\nresolve,--somehow or other, _somehow_, she would escape; she would get\nout of this hateful house, away from these greedy, grasping people; she\nwould manage somehow to find her way to the wood, and then--then for\nfreedom again!Cheered by her own resolution, she answered the woman\ncomposedly, and went into a detailed account of the birth, rearing, and\nselling of the pigs, which so fascinated her auditor that she was\nsurprised, when the recital was over, to find that it was nearly\nsupper-time.The doctor now entered, and taking his wife's place, began to ply Eily\nwith questions, each one artfully calculated to bring forth the longest\npossible reply:--\n\n\"How is it yer mother is related to the Countess's auld housekeeper,\navick; and why is it, that wid sich grand relations she niver got into\nthe castle at all?\"\"Phwhat was that I h'ard the other day about the looky bargain yer\nfather--honest man!--made wid the one-eyed peddler from beyant\nInniskeen?\"and--\n\n\"Is it thrue that yer mother makes all her butther out av skim-milk just\nby making the sign of the cross--God bless it!--over the churn?\"Although she did not like the doctor, Eily did, as she had said to the\nGreen Man, \"_loove_ to talk;\" so she chattered away, explaining and\ndisclaiming, while the diamonds and pearls flew like hail-stones from\nher lips, and her host and jailer sat watching them with looks of greedy\nrapture.Eily paused, fairly out of breath, just as Mrs.O'Shaughnessy entered,\nbringing her rather scanty supper.There was quite a pile of jewels in\nher lap and about her feet, while a good many had rolled to a distance;\nbut her heart sank within her as she compared the result of three hours'\nsteady talking with the end to which the rapacious doctor aspired.She was allowed to eat her supper in peace, but no sooner was it\nfinished than the questioning began again, and it was not until ten\no'clock had struck that the exhausted child was allowed to lay her head\ndown on the rude bed which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy had hastily made up for\nher.The next day was a weary one for poor Eily.From morning till night she\nwas obliged to talk incessantly, with only a brief space allowed for her\nmeals.The doctor and his wife mounted guard by turns, each asking\nquestions, until to the child's fancy they seemed like nothing but\nliving interrogation points.All day long, no matter what she was\ntalking about,--the potato-crop, or the black hen that the fox stole, or\nPhelim's measles,--her mind was fixed on one idea, that of escaping from\nher prison.If only some fortunate chance would call them both out of\nthe room at once!There was always a\npair of greedy eyes fixed on her, and on the now hated jewels which\ndropped in an endless stream from her lips; always a harsh voice in her\nears, rousing her, if she paused for an instant, by new questions as\nstupid as they were long.Once, indeed, the child stopped short, and declared that she could not\nand would not talk any more; but she was speedily shown the end of a\nbirch rod, with the hint that the doctor \"would be loth to use the likes\nav it on Dinnis Macarthy's choild; but her parints had given him charge\nto dhrive out the witchcraft be hook or be crook;

but sorrow o' me if I can feel as if there was a\nblissing an it, ava'!\"The third day came, and was already half over, when an urgent summons\ncame for Doctor O'Shaughnessy.One of his richest patrons had fallen\nfrom his horse and broken his leg, and the doctor must come on the\ninstant.The doctor grumbled and swore, but there was no help for it; so\nhe departed, after making his wife vow by all the saints in turn, that\nshe would not leave Eileen's side for an instant until he returned.When Eily heard the rattle of the gig and the sound of the pony's feet,\nand knew that the most formidable of her jailers was actually _gone_,\nher heart beat so loud for joy that she feared its throbbing would be\nheard.Now, at last, a loop-hole seemed to open for her.She had a plan\nalready in her head, and now there was a chance for her to carry it out.But an Irish girl of ten has shrewdness beyond her years, and no gleam\nof expression appeared in Eileen's face as she spoke to Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, who had been standing by the window to watch her\nhusband's departure, and who now returned to her seat.\"We'll be missin' the docthor this day, ma'm, won't we?\"\"He's\nso agrayable, ain't he, now?\"O'Shaughnessy, with something of a sigh.\"He's rale agrayable, Michael is--whin he wants to be,\" she added.\"Yis,\nI'll miss um more nor common to-day, for 'tis worn out I am intirely\nwid shlapin so little these two nights past.Sure, I _can't_ shlape, wid\nthim things a-shparklin' an' a-glowerin' at me the way they do;

the brown locks\nstreamed out on the wind; the little blue apron fluttered wildly, like a\nbanner of victory.with panting bosom, with parted lips,\nwith many a backward glance to see if any one were following; on went\nthe little maid, over field and fell, through moss and through mire,\ntill at last--oh, happy, blessed sight!--the dark forest rose before\nher, and she knew that she was saved.Quite at the other end of the wood lay the spot she was seeking; but she\nknew the way well, and on she went, but more carefully now,--parting the\nbranches so that she broke no living twig, and treading cautiously lest\nshe should crush the lady fern, which the Green Men love.How beautiful\nthe ferns were, uncurling their silver-green fronds and spreading their\nslender arms abroad!How pleasant,\nhow kind, how friendly was everything in the sweet green wood!And here at last was the oak-tree, and at the foot of it there stood the\nyellow toadstool, looking as if it did not care about anything or\nanybody, which in truth it did not: Breathless with haste and eagerness,\nEileen tapped the toadstool three times with a bit of holly, saying\nsoftly, \"Slanegher Banegher!there\nsat the Green Man, just as if he had been there all the time, fanning\nhimself with his scarlet cap, and looking at her with a comical twinkle\nin his sharp little eyes.\"Well, Eily,\" he said, \"is it back so soon ye are?Well, well, I'm not\nsurprised!\"Oh, yer Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!\"cried poor Eily, bursting\ninto tears, \"av ye'll plaze to take it away!Sure it's nearly kilt I am\nalong av it, an' no plazure or coomfort in ut at all at all!Take it\naway, yer Honor, take it away, and I'll bliss ye all me days!\"and, with\nmany sobs, she related the experiences of the past three days.As she\nspoke, diamonds and pearls still fell in showers from her lips, and\nhalf-unconsciously she held up her apron to catch them as they fell, so\nthat by the time she had finished her story she had more than a quart of\nsplendid gems, each as big as the biggest kind of pea.The Green Man smiled, but not unkindly, at the recital of Eileen's\nwoes.\"Faith, it's a hard time ye've had, my maiden, and no mistake!Hold fast the jewels ye have there, for they're the\nlast ye'll get.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.He touched her lips with his cap, and said, \"Cabbala\nku!Eily drew a long breath of relief, and the fairy added,--\n\n\"The truth is, Eily, the times are past for fairy gifts of this kind.Few people believe in the Green Men now at all, and fewer still ever see\nthem.Why, ye are the first mortal child I've spoken to for a matter of\ntwo hundred years, and I think ye'll be the last I ever speak to.Fairy\ngifts are very pretty things in a story, but they're not convenient at\nthe present time, as ye see for yourself.There's one thing I'd like to\nsay to ye, however,\" he added more seriously;

covered with living\ncreatures,--toads, snakes, newts, all hideous and unclean reptiles that\nhop or creep or wriggle.And as the wretched man stared, with open mouth\nand glaring eye-balls, oh, horror!they were all hopping, creeping,\nwriggling towards the open door,--towards him!With a yell beside which\nhis wife's had been a whisper, O'Shaughnessy turned and fled;

with our\nfather she left the old country many years ago.They were poor.--the\nfamily fortune being held in abeyance by the loss of some papers.I\nremained, but our father gave up all hope and emigrated to America,\ntaking Susan with him.In the course of nature the old man is dead,\nand my sister Susan, if she is living, is the last, or soon will be the\nlast, link of the family.I am making this statement as my last will and\ntestament.Some years ago the post-master in my native town received\na letter from America stating that by the confession of one, Alonzo\nPhelps, who was condemned to die, that there was a bundle of papers\nconcealed in a certain place by him before he left the country.Search\nwas made and the papers found which gave me the possession of the family\nestate.The letter was subscribed D. C., which gave a poor knowledge of\nthe writer.I sold the property and emigrated to this country in search\nof my sister; I have had poor success.She probably married, and the\nceremony changed her name, and I fear she is hopelessly lost to her\nrights; her name was Susan Lasco--what it is now, God only knows.But\nto Susan Lasco, and her descendants, I will the sum of twenty thousand\ndollars, now on deposit in a western bank; the certificate of deposit\nnames the bank; the papers are wet and now upon my person; the money in\nmy pocket, $110, I will to the good woman of this house--with a request\nthat she will carefully dry and preserve my papers, and deliver them\nto some respectable lawyer in Memphis----\u201d at this point the speaker was\nbreathing hard--his tone of voice almost inaudible.At his request,\nmade by signs, he was turned over and died in a few moments without any\nfurther directions.The inmates of the cabin, besides the good woman of the house, were only\na few wood cutters, among whom stood Brindle Bill, of Shirt-Tail\nBend notoriety.Bill, to use his own language, was _strap'd_, and was\nchopping wood at this point to raise a little money upon which to make\nanother start.Many years had passed away since he left Shirt Tail Bend.He had been three times set on shore, from steamboats, for playing sharp\ntricks at three card monte upon passengers, and he had gone to work,\nwhich he never did until he was entirely out of money.Brindle Bill left\nthe cabin, _ostensibly_ to go to work; but he sat upon the log, rubbed\nhis hand across his forehead, and said mentally, \u201cSusan La-s-co.By the\nlast card in the deck, _that is the name_; if I didn't hear Simon's\nwife, in Shirt-Tail Bend, years ago, say her mother's name was S-u-s-a-n\nL-a-s-c-o.I will never play another game; and--and _twenty thousand in\nbank_.By hell, I've struck a lead.\u201d\n\nThe ever open ear of the Angel of observation was catching the sound of\na conversation in the cabin of Sundown Hill in Shirt-Tail Bend.It was\nas follows--\n\n\u201cMany changes, Bill, since you left here; the Carlo wood yard has play'd\nout; Don Carlo went back to Kentucky.I heard he was blowed up on a\nsteamboat; if he ever come down again I did'nt hear of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope he never did,\u201d said Bill, chawing the old grudge with his eye\nteeth.Hill continued: \u201cYou see, Bill, the old wood yards have given place to\nplantations.Simon, your old friend, is making pretentions to be called\na planter,\u201d said Sundown Hill to Brindle Bill, in a tone of confidence.\u201cGo slow, Hill, there is a hen on the nest.I come back here to play a\nstrong game; twenty thousand in bank,\u201d and Brindle Bill winked with his\nright eye, the language of which is, I deal and you play the cards I\ngive you.\u201cYou heard of the burning of the Brandywine; well, there was\nan Englishman went up in that scrape, and he left twenty thousand in\nbank, and Rose Simon is the _heir_,\u201d said Bill in a tone of confidence.\u201cAnd what can that profit y-o-u?\u201d said Hill rather indignantly.\u201cI am playing this game; I want you to send for Simon,\u201d said Bill rather\ncommandingly.\u201cSimon has changed considerably since you saw him; and, besides,\nfortunes that come across the water seldom prove true.Men who have\nfortunes in their native land seldom seek fortunes in a strange\ncountry,\u201d said Hill argumentatively.\u201cThere is no mistake in this case, for uncle John had-the _di-dapper\neggs_ in his pocket,\u201d said Bill firmly.Late that evening three men, in close council, were seen, in Shirt-Tail\nBend.S. S. Simon had joined the company of the other two.After Brindle\nBill had related to Simon the events above described, the following\nquestions and answers, passed between the two:\n\n\u201cMrs.Simon's mother was named Susan Lasco?\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly; and her father's name was Tom Fairfield.She is the brave\nwoman who broke up, or rather burned up, the gambling den in Shirt-Tail\nBend.Evaline Estep, her parents having died when she was quite young.The old lady Estep tried to horn me off; but I _beat her_.Well the old\nChristian woman gave Rose a good many things, among which was a box of\nfamily keep sakes; she said they were given to her in consideration of\nher taking the youngest child of the orphan children.There may be\nsomething in that box to identify the family.\u201d\n\nAt this point Brindle Bill winked his right eye--it is my deal, you play\nthe cards I give you.As Simon was about to' leave the company, to break\nthe news to his wife, Brindle Bill said to him very confidentially:\n\u201cYou find out in what part of the country this division of the orphan\nchildren took place, and whenever you find that place, be where it\nwill, right there is where I was raised--the balance of them children is\n_dead_, Simon,\u201d and he again winked his right eye.\u201cI understand,\u201d said Simon, and as he walked on towards home to apprise\nRose of her good fortune, he said mentally, \u201cThis is Bill's deal, I will\nplay the cards he gives me.\u201d Simon was a shifty man; he stood in the\n_half-way house_ between the honest man and the rogue: was always ready\nto take anything he could lay hands on, as long as he could hold some\none else between himself and danger.Rose Simon received the news with\ndelight.She hastened to her box of keepsakes and held before Simon's\nastonished eyes an old breast-pin with this inscription: \u201cPresented to\nSusan Lasco by her brother, John A. Lasco, 1751.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's all the evidence we want,\u201d said Simon emphatically.\u201cNow,\u201d\n continued Simon, coaxingly, \u201cWhat became of your sisters?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know when Mrs.Estep moved to Tennessee I was quite small.I have\nheard nothing of my sisters since that time.It has been more than\nfifteen years,\u201d said Rose gravely.\u201cAt what point in Kentucky were you separated?\u201d said Simon inquiringly.\u201cPort William, the mouth of the Kentucky river,\u201d said Rose plainly.\u201cBrindle Bill says they are dead,\u201d said Simon slowly.\u201cB-r-i-n-d-l-e  B-i-l-l, why, I would not believe him on oath,\u201d said Rose\nindignantly.\u201cYes, but he can prove it,\u201d said Simon triumphantly, and he then\ncontinued, \u201cIf we leave any gaps down, _my dear_, we will not be able to\ndraw the money until those sisters are hunted up, and then it would cut\nus down to less than seven thousand dollars--and that would hardly build\nus a fine house,\u201d and with many fair and coaxing words Simon obtained a\npromise from Rose that she would permit him to manage the business.At the counter of a western bank stood S. S. Simon and party presenting\nthe certificate of deposit for twenty thousand dollars.In addition to\nthe breast-pin Rose had unfolded an old paper, that had laid for years\nin the bottom of her box.It was a certificate of the marriage of Tom\nFairfield and Susan Lasco.Brindle Bill and Sundown Hill were sworn and\ntestified that Rose Simon _alias_ Rose Fairfield was the only surviving\nchild of Tom Fairfield and Susan Lasco.Brindle Bill said he was raised\nin Port William, and was at the funeral of the little innocent years\nbefore, The money was paid over.Rose did not believe a word that\nBill said but she had promised Simon that she would let him manage the\nbusiness, and few people will refuse money when it is thrust upon them.Simon deceived Rose with the plea\nof some little debts, paid over to Brindle Bill and Sundown Hill three\nhundred dollars each.Brindle Bill soon got away with three hundred\ndollars; \u201cStrop'd again,\u201d he said mentally, and then continued, \u201cSome\ncall it blackmailin' or backmailin', but I call it a _back-handed_ game.It is nothing but making use of power, and if a fellow don't use power\nwhen it's put in his hands he had better bunch tools and quit.\u201d\n Brindle Bill said to S. S. Simon, \u201cI have had a streak of bad luck; lost\nall my money; want to borrow three hundred dollars.No use to say you\nhavn't got it, for I can find them sisters of your wife in less than\nthree weeks,\u201d and he winked his right eye.Simon hesitated, but finally with many words of caution paid over the\nmoney.Soon after these events S. S. Simon was greatly relieved by reading in\na newspaper the account of the sentence of Brindle Bill to the state\nprison for a long term of years.S. S. Simon now stood in the front rank of the planters of his\nneighborhood; had built a new house and ready to furnish it; Rose was\npersuaded by him to make the trip with him to New Orleans and select her\nfurniture for the new house.While in the city Rose Simon was attacked\nwith the yellow fever and died on the way home.She was buried in\nLouisiana, intestate and childless.SCENE FIFTH.--THE BELLE OF PORT WILLIAM.```A cozy room, adorned with maiden art,\n\n```Contained the belle of Port William's heart.```There she stood--to blushing love unknown,\n\n```Her youthful heart was all her own.```Her sisters gone, and every kindred tie,\n\n```Alone she smiled, alone she had to cry;\n\n```No mother's smile, no father's kind reproof,\n\n```She hop'd and pray'd beneath a stranger's roof.=\n\n|The voice of history and the practice of historians has been to dwell\nupon the marching of armies; the deeds of great heroes; the rise and\nfall of governments; great battles and victories; the conduct of troops,\netc., while the manners and customs of the people of whom they write are\nentirely ignored.Were it not for the common law of England, we would have a poor\nknowledge of the manners and customs of the English people long\ncenturies ago.The common law was founded upon the manners and customs of the people,\nand many of the principles of the common law have come down to the\npresent day.And a careful study of the common laws of England is the\nbest guide to English civilization long centuries ago.Manners and customs change with almost every generation, yet the\nprinciples upon which our manners and customs are founded are less\nchangeable.Change is marked upon almost everything It is said that the particles\nwhich compose our bodies change in every seven years.The oceans\nand continents change in a long series of ages.Change is one of the\nuniversal laws of matter.Brother Demitt left Port\nWilliam, on foot and full of whisky, one cold evening in December.The\npath led him across a field fenced from the suburbs of the village.The\nold man being unable to mount the fence, sat down to rest with his back\nagainst the fence--here it is supposed he fell into a stupid sleep.The\ncold north wind--that never ceases to blow because some of Earth's poor\nchildren are intoxicated--wafted away the spirit of the old man, and\nhis neighbors, the next morning, found the old man sitting against the\nfence, frozen, cold and dead.Old Arch Wheataker, full of whisky, was running old Ball for home one\nevening in the twilight.Old Ball, frightened at something by the side\nof the road, threw the old man against a tree, and \u201cbusted\u201d his head.Dave Deminish had retired from business and given place to the\nbrilliantly lighted saloon.Old Dick, the <DW64> man, was sleeping\nbeneath the sod, with as little pain in his left foot as any other\nmember of his body.Joe, the <DW52> boy that drove the wood slide so\nfast through the snow with the little orphan girls, had left home, found\nhis way to Canada, and was enjoying his freedom in the Queen s Dominion.The Demitt estate had passed through the hands of administrators much\nreduced.Old Demitt died intestate, and Aunt Katy had no children.His\nrelations inherited his estate,", "question": "Where is John?
