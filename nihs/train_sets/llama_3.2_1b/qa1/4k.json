[{"input": "And when it became necessary in 1791 to divide Canada into two\nprovinces, Upper Canada and Lower Canada, one predominantly English and\nthe other predominantly French, the two provinces were granted\nprecisely equal political rights.Out of this {8} arose an odd\nsituation.All French Canadians were Roman Catholics, and Roman\nCatholics were at this time debarred from sitting in the House of\nCommons at Westminster.Yet they were given the right of sitting as\nmembers in the Canadian representative Assemblies created by the Act of\n1791.The Catholics of Canada thus received privileges denied to their\nco-religionists in Great Britain.There can be no doubt that it was the conciliatory policy of the\nBritish government which kept the clergy, the seigneurs, and the great\nbody of French Canadians loyal to the British crown during the war in\n1775 and in 1812.It is certain, too, that these generous measures\nstrengthened the position of the French race in Canada, made Canadians\nmore jealous of their national identity, and led them to press for\nstill wider liberties.It is an axiom of human nature that the more\none gets, the more one wants.And so the concessions granted merely\nwhetted the Canadian appetite for more.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.This disposition became immediately apparent with the calling of the\nfirst parliament of Lower Canada in 1792.Before this there had been\nno specific definition of the exact status of the French language in\n{9} Canada, and the question arose as to its use in the Assembly as a\nmedium of debate.As the Quebec Act of 1774 had restored the French\nlaws, it was inferred that the use of the French language had been\nauthorized, since otherwise these laws would have no natural medium of\ninterpretation.That this was the inference to be drawn from the\nconstitution became evident, for the British government had made no\nobjection to the use of French in the law-courts.It should be borne\nin mind that at this period the English in Canada were few in number,\nand that all of them lived in the cities.The French members in the\nAssembly, representing, as they did, nearly the whole population, did\nnot hesitate to press for the official recognition of their language on\na parity with English.The question first came up in connection with the election of a\nspeaker.The French-Canadian members, being in a majority of\nthirty-four to sixteen, proposed Jean Antoine Panet.This motion was\nopposed by the English members, together with a few of the French\nmembers, who nominated an Englishman.They pointed out that the\ntransactions between the speaker and the king's {10} representative in\nthe colony should be 'in the language of the empire to which we have\nthe happiness to belong.''I think it is but decent,' said Louis\nPanet, brother of Jean Antoine, 'that the speaker on whom we fix our\nchoice, be one who can express himself in English when he addresses\nhimself to the representative of our sovereign.'Yet the majority of\nthe French members stuck to their motion and elected their speaker.When he was sworn into office, he declared to the governor that 'he\ncould only express himself in the primitive language of his native\ncountry.'Nevertheless, he understood English well enough to conduct\nthe business of the House.And it should not be forgotten that all the\nsixteen English members, out of the fifty composing the Assembly, owed\ntheir election to French-Canadian voters.Almost immediately the question came up again in the debate on the use\nof the French language in the publication of official documents.The\nEnglish members pointed out that English was the language of the\nsovereign, and they contended that the exclusive official use of the\nEnglish language would more quickly assimilate the French\nCanadians--would render them more loyal.To these {11} arguments the\nFrench Canadians replied with ringing eloquence.'Remember,' said Chartier de Lotbiniere, 'the year 1775.Those\nCanadians, who spoke nothing but French, showed their attachment to\ntheir sovereign in a manner not at all equivocal.This city, these walls, this chamber in which I\nhave the honour to speak, were saved partly through their zeal and\ntheir courage.You saw them join with faithful subjects of His Majesty\nand repulse attacks which people who spoke very good English made on\nthis city.It is not, you see, uniformity of language which makes\npeoples more faithful or more united.''Is it not ridiculous,' exclaimed Pierre Bedard, whose name will appear\nlater in these pages, 'to wish to make a people's loyalty consist in\nits tongue?'The outcome of the debate, as might have been expected, was to place\nthe French language on a level with the English language in the records\nand publications of the Assembly, and French became, to all intents and\npurposes, the language of debate.The number of English-speaking\nmembers steadily decreased.In the year 1800 Sir Robert Milnes {12}\nwrote home that there were 'but one or two English members in the House\nof Assembly who venture to speak in the language of the mother country,\nfrom the certainty of not being understood by a great majority of the\nHouse.'It must not be imagined, however, that in these early debates there was\nany of that rancour and animosity which later characterized the\nproceedings of the Assembly of Lower Canada.'The remains of the old\nFrench politeness, and a laudable deference to their fellow subjects,\nkept up decorum in the proceedings of the majority,' testified a\npolitical annalist of that time.Even as late as 1807, it appears that\n'party spirit had not yet extended its effects to destroy social\nintercourse and good neighbourhood.'It was not until the regime of\nSir James Craig that racial bitterness really began.{13}\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n'THE REIGN OF TERROR'\n\nDuring the session of 1805 the Assembly was confronted with the\napparently innocent problem of building prisons.Yet out of the debate\non this subject sprang the most serious racial conflict which had yet\noccurred in the province.There were two ways proposed for raising the\nnecessary money.One, advocated by the English members, was to levy a\ndirect tax on land; the other, proposed by the French members, was to\nimpose extra customs duties.The English proposal was opposed by the\nFrench, for the simple reason that the interests of the French were in\nthe main agrarian; and the French proposal was opposed by the English,\nbecause the interests of the English were on the whole commercial.The\nEnglish pointed out that, as merchants, they had borne the brunt of\nsuch taxation as had already been imposed, and that it was the turn of\nthe French farmers to bear their {14} share.The French, on the other\nhand, pointed out, with some justice, that indirect taxation was borne,\nnot only by the importer, but also partly by the consumer, and that\nindirect taxation was therefore more equitable than a tax on the\nland-owners alone.'The\n_Habitants_,' writes the political annalist already quoted, 'consider\nthemselves sufficiently taxed by the French law of the land, in being\nobliged to pay rents and other feudal burthens to the Seigneur, and\ntythes to the Priest; and if you were to ask any of them to contribute\ntwo bushels of Wheat, or two Dollars, for the support of Government, he\nwould give you the equivocal French sign of inability or unwillingness,\nby shrugging up his shoulders.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.As usual, the French-Canadian majority carried their point.Thereupon,\nthe indignation of the English minority flared forth in a very emphatic\nmanner.They accused the French Canadians of foisting upon them the\nwhole burden of taxation, and they declared that an end must be put to\nFrench-Canadian domination over English Canadians.'This province,'\nasserted the Quebec _Mercury_, 'is already too French for a British\ncolony....  Whether we be in peace or at war, it is essential {15} that\nwe should make every effort, by every means available, to oppose the\ngrowth of the French and their influence.'The answer of the French Canadians to this language was the\nestablishment in 1806 of a newspaper, _Le Canadien_, in which the point\nof view of the majority in the House might be presented.The official\neditor of the paper was Jean Antoine Bouthillier, but the conspicuous\nfigure on the staff was Pierre Bedard, one of the members of the House\nof Assembly.The tone of the paper was generally moderate, though\nmilitant.Its policy was essentially to defend the French against the\nceaseless aspersions of the _Mercury_ and other enemies.It never\nattacked the British government, but only the provincial authorities.Its motto, '_Notre langue, nos institutions et nos lois_,' went far to\nexplain its views and objects.No serious trouble resulted, however, from the policy of _Le Canadien_\nuntil after the arrival of Sir James Craig in Canada, and the\ninauguration of what some historians have named 'the Reign of Terror.'Sir James Craig, who became governor of Canada in 1807, was a\ndistinguished soldier.He had seen service in the American\nRevolutionary {16} War, in South Africa, and in India.He was,\nhowever, inexperienced in civil government and apt to carry his ideas\nof military discipline into the conduct of civil affairs.Moreover, he\nwas prejudiced against the inhabitants and had doubts of their loyalty.In Canada he surrounded himself with such men as Herman W. Ryland, the\ngovernor's secretary, and John Sewell, the attorney-general, men who\nwere actually in favour of repressing the French Canadians and of\ncrushing the power of their Church.'I have long since laid it down as\na principle (which in my judgment no Governor of this Province ought to\nlose sight of for a moment),' wrote Ryland in 1804, 'by every possible\nmeans which prudence can suggest, gradually to undermine the authority\nand influence of the Roman Catholic Priest.''The Province must be\nconverted into an English Colony,' declared Sewell, 'or it will\nultimately be lost to England.'The opinion these men held of the\nFrench Canadians was most uncomplimentary.'In the ministerial\ndictionary,' complained _Le Canadien_, 'a bad fellow,\nanti-ministerialist, democrat, _sans culotte_, and damned Canadian,\nmean the same thing.'From a portrait in the Dominion\nArchives.]Surrounded by such advisers, it is not {17} surprising that Sir James\nCraig soon took umbrage at the language and policy of _Le Canadien_.At first he made his displeasure felt in a somewhat roundabout way.In\nthe summer of 1808 he dismissed from the militia five officers who were\nreputed to have a connection with that newspaper, on the ground that\nthey were helping a'seditious and defamatory journal.'<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.One of these\nofficers was Colonel Panet, who had fought in the defence of Quebec in\n1775 and had been speaker of the House of Assembly since 1792; another\nwas Pierre Bedard.This action did not, however, curb the temper of\nthe paper; and a year or more later Craig went further.In May 1810 he\ntook the extreme step of suppressing _Le Canadien_, and arresting the\nprinter and three of the proprietors, Taschereau, Blanchet, and Bedard.The ostensible pretext for this measure was the publication in the\npaper of some notes of a somewhat academic character with regard to the\nconflict which had arisen between the governor and the House of\nAssembly in Jamaica; the real reason, of course, went deeper.Craig afterwards asserted that the arrest of Bedard and his associates\nwas 'a measure of precaution, not of punishment.'There is no {18}\ndoubt that he actually feared a rising of the French Canadians.The event showed that his suspicions\nwere ill-founded; but in justice to him it must be remembered that he\nwas governor of Canada at a dangerous time, when Napoleon was at the\nzenith of his power and when agents of this arch-enemy of England were\nsupposed to be active in Canada.Moreover, the blame for Craig's\naction during this period must be partly borne by the 'Bureaucrats' who\nsurrounded him.There is no absolute proof, but there is at least a\npresumption, that some of these men actually wished to precipitate a\ndisturbance, in order that the constitution of Lower Canada might be\nsuspended and a new order of things inaugurated.Soon after Bedard's arrest his friends applied for a writ of habeas\ncorpus; but, owing to the opposition of Craig, this was refused.In\nJuly two of Bedard's companions were released, on the ground of ill\nhealth.They both, however, expressed regret at the tone which _Le\nCanadien_ had adopted.Bedard\nhimself declined to accept his release until he had been brought to\ntrial and acquitted {19} of the charge preferred against him.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.Craig,\nhowever, did not dare to bring him to trial, for no jury would have\nconvicted him.Ultimately, since Bedard refused to leave the prison,\nhe was ejected at the point of the bayonet.Bedard was an excellent mathematician, and was in the habit of\nwhiling away the hours of his imprisonment by solving mathematical\nproblems.When the guard came to turn him out, he was in the midst of\na geometrical problem.'At least,' he begged, 'let me finish my\nproblem.'The request was granted; an hour later the problem was\nsolved, and Bedard was thrust forth from the jail.Sir James Craig was a man of good heart and of the best intentions; but\nhis course throughout this episode was most unfortunate.Not only did\nhe fail to suppress the opposition to his government, but he did much\nto embitter the relations between the two races.Craig himself seems\nto have realized, even before he left Canada, that his policy had been\na mistake; for he is reported on good authority to have said 'that he\nhad been basely deceived, and that if it had been given to him to begin\nhis administration over again, he would have acted differently.'It is\n{20} significant, too, that Craig's successor, Sir George Prevost,\ncompletely reversed his policy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.He laid himself out to conciliate the\nFrench Canadians in every way possible; and he made amends to Bedard\nfor the injustice which he had suffered by restoring him to his rank in\nthe militia and by making him a judge.As a result, the bitterness of\nracial feeling abated; and when the War of 1812 broke out, there proved\nto be less disloyalty in Lower Canada than in Upper Canada.But, as\nthe events of Craig's administration had clearly shown, a good deal of\ncombustible and dangerous material lay about.{21}\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE RISE OF PAPINEAU\n\nIn the year 1812 a young man took his seat in the House of Assembly for\nLower Canada who was destined to play a conspicuous part in the history\nof the province during the next quarter of a century.His name was\nLouis Joseph Papineau.He was at that time only twenty-six years of\nage, but already his tall, well-built form, his fine features and\ncommanding presence, marked him out as a born leader of men.He\npossessed an eloquence which, commonplace as it now appears on the\nprinted page, apparently exerted a profound influence upon his\ncontemporaries.'Never within the memory of teacher or student,' wrote\nhis college friend Aubert de Gaspe, 'had a voice so eloquent filled the\nhalls of the seminary of Quebec.'In the Assembly his rise to\nprominence was meteoric; only three years after his entrance he was\nelected speaker on the resignation of the veteran {22} J. A. Panet, who\nhad held the office at different times since 1792.Papineau retained\nthe speakership, with but one brief period of intermission, until the\noutbreak of rebellion twenty-two years later; and it was from the\nspeaker's chair that he guided throughout this period the counsels of\nthe _Patriote_ party.[Illustration: Louis Joseph Papineau.After a lithograph by Maurin,\nParis.]When Papineau entered public life the political situation in Lower\nCanada was beginning to be complicated.The French-Canadian members of\nthe Assembly, having taken great pains to acquaint themselves with the\nlaw and custom of the British constitution, had awakened to the fact\nthat they were not enjoying the position or the power which the members\nof the House of Commons in England were enjoying.In the first place,\nthe measures which they passed were being continually thrown out by the\nupper chamber, the Legislative Council, and they", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "The members of the\ntwo councils were in the main of English birth, and they constituted a\nlocal oligarchy--known as the 'Bureaucrats' or the 'Chateau\nClique'--which {23} held the reins of government.They were as a rule\nable to snap their fingers at the majority in the Assembly.In England the remedy for a similar state of affairs had been found to\nlie in the control of the purse exercised by the House of Commons.In\norder to bring the Executive to its will, it was only necessary for\nthat House to threaten the withholding of supplies.In Lower Canada,\nhowever, such a remedy was at first impossible, for the simple reason\nthat the House of Assembly did not vote all the supplies necessary for\ncarrying on the government.In other words, the expenditure far\nexceeded the revenue; and the deficiency had to be met out of the\nImperial exchequer.Under these circumstances it was impossible for\nthe Lower Canada Assembly to attempt to exercise the full power of the\npurse.In 1810, it is true, the Assembly had passed a resolution\navowing its ability and willingness to vote 'the necessary sums for\ndefraying the Civil Expenses of the Government of the Province.'But\nSir James Craig had declined on a technicality to forward the\nresolution to the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, realizing fully\nthat if the offer were accepted, the Assembly would be able to exert\ncomplete {24} power over the Executive.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.'The new Trojan horse' was not\nto gain admission to the walls through him.Later, however, in 1818, during the administration of Sir John Coape\nSherbrooke, the offer of the Assembly was accepted by the Imperial\ngovernment.Sherbrooke was an apostle of conciliation.It was he who\ngave the Catholic bishop of Quebec a seat in the Executive Council; and\nhe also recommended that the speaker of the House of Assembly should be\nincluded in the Council--a recommendation which was a preliminary move\nin the direction of responsible government.Through Sherbrooke's\ninstrumentality the British government now decided to allow the\nLower-Canadian legislature to vote the entire revenue of the province,\napart from the casual and territorial dues of the Crown and certain\nduties levied by Act of the Imperial parliament.Sherbrooke's\nintention was that the legislature should vote out of this revenue a\npermanent civil list to be continued during the lifetime of the\nsovereign.Unfortunately, however, the Assembly did not fall in with\nthis view.It insisted, instead, on treating the civil list as an\nannual affair, and voting the salaries of the officials, from the\ngovernor {25} downwards, for only one year.Since this would have made\nevery government officer completely dependent upon the pleasure of the\nHouse of Assembly, the Legislative Council promptly threw out the\nbudget.Thus commenced a struggle which was destined to last for many\nyears.The Assembly refused to see that its action was really an\nencroachment upon the sphere of the Executive; and the Executive\nrefused to place itself at the mercy of the Assembly.During session after session the supplies were not voted.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.The Executive, with its control of the royal revenue, was able by one\nmeans or another to carry on the government; but the relations between\nthe 'Bureaucrats' and the _Patriotes_ became rapidly more bitter.Papineau's attitude toward the government during this period was in\nharmony with that of his compatriots.It was indeed one of his\ncharacteristics, as the historian Christie has pointed out, that he\nseemed always 'to move with the masses rather than to lead them.'In\n1812 he fought side by side with the British.As late as 1820 he\npublicly expressed his great admiration for the constitution of 1791\nand the blessings of British rule.But in the struggles over the\nbudget he took up ground {26} strongly opposed to the government; and,\nwhen the question became acute, he threw restraint to the winds, and\nplayed the part of a dangerous agitator.What seems to have first roused Papineau to anger was a proposal to\nunite Upper and Lower Canada in 1822.Financial difficulties had\narisen between the two provinces; and advantage was taken of this fact\nto introduce a Union Bill into the House of Commons at Westminster,\ncouched in terms very unfavourable to the French Canadians.There is\nlittle doubt that the real objects of the bill was the extinction of\nthe Lower-Canadian Assembly and the subordination of the French to the\nEnglish element in the colony.At any rate, the French Canadians saw\nin the bill a menace to their national existence.Two agents were\npromptly appointed to go over to London to oppose it.One of them was\nPapineau; the other was John Neilson, the capable Scottish editor of\nthe Quebec _Gazette_.The two men made a very favourable impression;\nthey enlisted on their side the leaders of the Whig party in the\nCommons; and they succeeded in having the bill well and duly shelved.Their mission resulted not only in the defeat of the bill; it also\nshowed {27} them clearly that a deep-laid plot had menaced the rights\nand liberties of the French-Canadian people; and their anger was roused\nagainst what Neilson described as 'the handful of _intrigants_' who had\nplanned that _coup d'etat_.On returning to Canada Papineau gave vent to his discontent in an\nextraordinary attack upon Lord Dalhousie, who had become governor of\nCanada in 1819.Dalhousie was an English nobleman of the best type.He was instrumental in founding the Literary\nand Historical Society of Quebec; and he showed his desire for pleasant\nrelations between the two races in Canada by the erection of the joint\nmonument to Wolfe and Montcalm in the city of Quebec, in the governor's\ngarden.His administration, however, had been marred by one or two\nfinancial irregularities.Owing to the refusal of the Assembly to vote\na permanent civil list, Dalhousie had been forced to expend public\nmoneys without authority from the legislature; and his\nreceiver-general, Caldwell, had been guilty of defalcations to the\namount of L100,000.Papineau attacked Dalhousie as if he had been\npersonally responsible for these defalcations.The speech, we are told\nby the chronicler Bibaud, recalled in its violence the {28} philippics\nof Demosthenes and the orations against Catiline of Cicero.The upshot of this attack was that all relations between Dalhousie and\nPapineau were broken off.Apart altogether from the political\ncontroversy, Dalhousie felt that he could have no intercourse with a\nman who had publicly insulted him.Consequently, when Papineau was\nelected to the speakership of the Assembly in 1827, Dalhousie refused\nto recognize him as speaker; and when the Assembly refused to\nreconsider his election, Dalhousie promptly dissolved it.It would be tedious to describe in detail the political events of these\nyears; and it is enough to say that by 1827 affairs in the province had\ncome to such an impasse, partly owing to the financial quarrel, and\npartly owing to the personal war between Papineau and Dalhousie, that\nit was decided by the _Patriotes_ to send another deputation to England\nto ask for the redress of grievances and for the removal of Dalhousie.The members of the deputation were John Neilson and two French\nCanadians, Augustin Cuvillier and Denis B. Viger.Papineau was an\ninterested party and did not go.The deputation proved no less\nsuccessful than {29} that which had crossed the Atlantic in 1822.The\ndelegates succeeded in obtaining Lord Dalhousie's recall, and they were\nenabled to place their case before a special committee of the House of\nCommons.The committee made a report very favourable to the _Patriote_\ncause; recommended that 'the French-Canadians should not in any way be\ndisturbed in the exercise and enjoyment of their religion, their laws,\nor their privileges'; and expressed the opinion that 'the true\ninterests of the provinces would be best promoted by placing the\ncollection and expenditure of all public revenues under the control of\nthe House of Assembly.'The report was not actually adopted by the\nHouse of Commons, but it lent a very welcome support to the contentions\nof Papineau and his friends.At last, in 1830, the British government made a serious and well-meant\nattempt to settle, once and for all, the financial difficulty.Lord\nGoderich, who was at that time at the Colonial Office, instructed Lord\nAylmer, who had become governor of Canada in 1830, to resign to the\nAssembly the control of the entire revenue of the province, with the\nsingle exception of the casual and territorial revenue of the Crown, if\nthe Assembly would grant {30} in exchange a civil list of L19,000,\nvoted for the lifetime of the king.This offer was a compromise which\nshould have proved acceptable to both sides.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.But Papineau and his\nfriends determined not to yield an inch of ground; and in the session\nof 1831 they succeeded in defeating the motion for the adoption of Lord\nGoderich's proposal.That this was a mistake even the historian\nGarneau, who cannot be accused of hostility toward the _Patriotes_, has\nadmitted.Throughout this period Papineau's course was often unreasonable.He\ncomplained that the French Canadians had no voice in the executive\ngovernment, and that all the government offices were given to the\nEnglish; yet when he was offered a seat in the Executive Council in\n1822 he declined it; and when Dominique Mondelet, one of the members of\nthe Assembly, accepted a seat in the Executive Council in 1832, he was\nhounded from the Assembly by Papineau and his friends as a traitor.As\nSir George Cartier pointed out many years later, Mondelet's inclusion\nin the Executive Council was really a step in the direction of\nresponsible government.It is difficult, also, to approve Papineau's\nattitude toward such governors as Dalhousie and {31} Aylmer, both of\nwhom were disposed to be friendly.Papineau's attitude threw them into\nthe arms of the 'Chateau Clique.'The truth is that Papineau was too\nunbending, too _intransigeant_, to make a good political leader.As\nwas seen clearly in his attitude toward the financial proposals of Lord\nGoderich in 1830, he possessed none of that spirit of compromise which\nlies at the heart of English constitutional development.On the other hand, it must be remembered that Papineau and his friends\nreceived much provocation.The attitude of the governing class toward\nthem was overbearing and sometimes insolent.They were regarded as\nmembers of an inferior race.And they would have been hardly human if\nthey had not bitterly resented the conspiracy against their liberties\nembodied in the abortive Union Bill of 1822.There were real abuses to\nbe remedied.Grave financial irregularities had been detected in the\nexecutive government; sinecurists, living in England, drew pay for\nservices which they did not perform; gross favouritism existed in\nappointments to office under the Crown; and so many office-holders held\nseats in the Legislative Council that the Council was actually under\nthe thumb of {32} the executive government.Yet when the Assembly\nstrove to remedy these grievances, its efforts were repeatedly blocked\nby the Legislative Council; and even when appeal was made to the\nColonial Office, removal of the abuses was slow in coming.Last, but\nnot least, the Assembly felt that it did not possess an adequate\ncontrol over the expenditure of the moneys for the voting of which it\nwas primarily responsible.{33}\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE NINETY-TWO RESOLUTIONS\n\nAfter 1830 signs began to multiply that the racial feud in Lower Canada\nwas growing in intensity.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.In 1832 a by-election in the west ward of\nMontreal culminated in a riot.Troops were called out to preserve\norder.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.After showing some forbearance under a fusillade of stones,\nthey fired into the rioters, killing three and wounding two men, all of\nthem French Canadians.Immediately the _Patriote_ press became\nfurious.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.The newspaper _La Minerve_ asserted that a 'general massacre'\nhad been planned: the murderers, it said, had approached the corpses\nwith laughter, and had seen with joy Canadian blood running down the\nstreet; they had shaken each other by the hand, and had regretted that\nthere were not more dead.The blame for the'massacre' was laid at the\ndoor of Lord Aylmer.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Later, on the floor of the Assembly, Papineau\nremarked that 'Craig merely imprisoned his {34} victims, but Aylmer\nslaughters them.'The _Patriotes_ adopted the same bitter attitude\ntoward the government when the Asiatic cholera swept the province in\n1833.They actually accused Lord Aylmer of having 'enticed the sick\nimmigrants into the country, in order to decimate the ranks of the\nFrench Canadians.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.In the House Papineau became more and more violent and domineering.He\ndid not scruple to use his majority either to expel from the House or\nto imprison those who incurred his wrath.Robert Christie, the member\nfor Gaspe, was four times expelled for having obtained the dismissal of\nsome partisan justices of the peace.The expulsion of Dominique\nMondelet has already been mentioned.Ralph Taylor, one of the members\nfor the Eastern Townships, was imprisoned in the common jail for using,\nin the Quebec _Mercury_, language about Papineau no more offensive than\nPapineau had used about many others.But perhaps the most striking\nevidence of Papineau's desire to dominate the Assembly was seen in his\nattitude toward a bill to secure the independence of judges introduced\nby F. A. Quesnel, one of the more moderate members {35} of the\n_Patriote_ party.Quesnel had accepted some amendments suggested by\nthe colonial secretary.This awoke the wrath of Papineau, who assailed\nthe bill in his usual vehement style, and concluded by threatening\nQuesnel with the loss of his seat.Papineau possessed at this time a great ascendancy over the minds of\nhis fellow-countrymen, and in the next elections he secured Quesnel's\ndefeat.By 1832 Papineau's political views had taken a more revolutionary turn.From being an admirer of the constitution of 1791, he had come to\nregard it as 'bad; very, very bad.''Our constitution,' he said, 'has\nbeen manufactured by a Tory influenced by the terrors of the French\nRevolution.'He had lost faith in the justice of the British\ngovernment and in its willingness to redress grievances; and his eyes\nhad begun to turn toward the United States.Perhaps he was not yet for\nannexation to that country; but he had conceived a great admiration for\nthe American constitution.The wide application of the principle of\nelection especially attracted him; and, although he did not relinquish\nhis hope of subordinating the Executive to the Assembly by means of the\ncontrol of the finances, he {36} began to throw his main weight into an\nagitation to make the Legislative Council elective.Henceforth the\nplan for an elective Legislative Council became the chief feature of\nthe policy of the _Patriote_ party.The existing nominated and\nreactionary Legislative Council had served the purpose of a buffer\nbetween the governor's Executive Council and the Assembly.This\nbuffer, thought Papineau and his friends, should be removed, so as to\nexpose the governor to the full hurricane of the Assembly's wrath.It was not long before Papineau's domineering behaviour and the\nrevolutionary trend of his views alienated some of his followers.On\nJohn Neilson, who had gone to England with him in 1822 and with\nCuvillier and Viger in 1828, and who had supported him heartily during\nthe Dalhousie regime, Papineau could no longer count.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.Under Aylmer a\ncoolness sprang up between the two men.Neilson objected to the\nexpulsion of Mondelet from the House; he opposed the resolutions of\nLouis Bourdages, Papineau's chief lieutenant,", "question": "Where is John?

Cartier and Etienne P. Tache.Nor were his\nsupporters all French Canadians.Some English-speaking members acted\nwith him, among them Wolfred Nelson; and in the country he had the\nundivided allegiance of men like Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, editor of\nthe Montreal _Vindicator_, {38} and Thomas Storrow Brown, afterwards\none of the 'generals' of the rebellion.Although the political\nstruggle in Lower Canada before 1837 was largely racial, it was not\nexclusively so, for there were some English in the Patriots party and\nsome French who declined to support it.In 1832 and 1833 Papineau suffered rebuffs in the House that could not\nhave been pleasant to him.In 1833, for instance, his proposal to\nrefuse supply was defeated by a large majority.But the triumphant\npassage of the famous Ninety-Two Resolutions in 1834 showed that, for\nmost purposes, he still had a majority behind him.The Ninety-Two Resolutions were introduced by Elzear Bedard, the son of\nPierre Bedard, and are reputed to have been drawn up by A. N. Morin.But there is no doubt that they were inspired by Papineau.The voice\nwas the voice of Jacob, but the hand was the hand of Esau.The\nResolutions constituted the political platform of the extreme wing of\nthe _Patriote_ party: they were a sort of Declaration of Right.A more\nextraordinary political document has seldom seen the light.A writer\nin the Quebec _Mercury_, said by Lord Aylmer to be John Neilson, {39}\nundertook an analysis of the ninety-two articles: eleven, said this\nwriter, stood true; six contained both truth and falsehood; sixteen\nstood wholly false; seventeen seemed doubtful and twelve ridiculous;\nseven were repetitions; fourteen consisted only of abuse; four were\nboth false and seditious; and the remainder were indifferent.It is not possible here to analyse the Resolutions in detail.They\ncalled the attention of the home government to some real abuses.The\nsubservience of the Legislative Council to the Executive Council; the\npartisanship of some of the judges; the maladministration of the wild\nlands; grave irregularities in the receiver-general's office; the\nconcentration of a variety of public offices in the same persons; the\nfailure of the governor to issue a writ for the election of a\nrepresentative for the county of Montreal; and the expenditure of\npublic moneys without the consent of the Assembly--all these, and many\nothers, were enlarged upon.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.If the framers of the Resolutions had only\ncared to make out a very strong case they might have done so.But the\nlanguage which they employed to present their case was almost certainly\ncalculated to injure it seriously in the eyes of the home government._The Bishop_ (_who has a holy horror of the_ Countess).I--ah--fear\nI cannot charge my memory so precisely, my dear Lady CANTIRE.We--ah--differ unfortunately on so many subjects.I trust, however, we\nmay--ah--agree to suspend hostilities on this occasion?_Lady Cant._ (_with even more bonhomie_).Don't be too sure of _that_,\nBishop.I've several crows to pluck with you, and we are to go in to\ndinner together, you know!I had no conception that such a pleasure was in\nstore for me!(_To himself._) This must be the penance for breaking my\nrule of never dining out on Saturday!_Lady Cant._ I wonder, Bishop, if you have seen this wonderful volume of\npoetry that everyone is talking about--_Andromeda_?_The Bishop_ (_conscientiously_).I chanced only this morning, by way of\nmomentary relaxation, to take up a journal containing a notice of that\nwork, with copious extracts.The impression left on my mind\nwas--ah--unfavourable; a certain talent, no doubt, some felicity of\nexpression, but a noticeable lack of the--ah--reticence, the discipline,\nthe--the scholarly touch which a training at one of our great Public\nSchools (I forbear to particularise), and at a University, can alone\nimpart.I was also pained to observe a crude discontent with the\nexisting Social System--a system which, if not absolutely perfect,\ncannot be upset or even modified without the gravest danger.But I was\nstill more distressed to note in several passages a decided taint of the\nmorbid sensuousness which renders so much of our modern literature\nsickly and unwholesome._Lady Cant._ All prejudice, my dear Bishop; why, you haven't even _read_\nthe book!However, the author is staying here now, and I feel convinced\nthat if you only knew him, you'd alter your opinion.Such an unassuming,\ninoffensive creature!I'll call him over\nhere....

during many pleasant\nweeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for\na long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence\nupon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of\nyou.\"(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly\nbenignant smile.)\"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the\ndripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of\na cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,\nunusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by\nthe boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must\nhave used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any\ncircumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have\naroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to\nascertain the cause.\"Then,\" said the magistrate, \"how do you account for the injuries the\nman who escaped must have undoubtedly received?\"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.There\nwas a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was\npushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one\nwhose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so\nweak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I\nrecognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the\nThree Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they\nwandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing\nsteadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head\ndrooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran\nthrough him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very\nshort time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be\nobtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,\nand although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was\nin itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to\nsay in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not\na word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,\ninstructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a\nstrict watch should be kept over him.While the unsuccessful\nexamination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise\nhis eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he\ncould not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and\neach time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a\nshudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the\nroom in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my\nmind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the\nconclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in\nhis right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his\ncrime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the\nmagistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of\npretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a\nsearch for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for\nnone had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of\nthe ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in\nguilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said\nhe had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour\nor so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I\ndeparted alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again\npropounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which\nhe listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been\nbefore that a struggle had taken place.\"But,\" he said, \"whether a struggle for life did or did not take place\nthere is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always\nviewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in\nthis instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,\nto mete out to him the punishment for his crime.\"Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to\ncommunicate to us.\"I have had,\" he said, \"another interview with the prisoner, and have\nsucceeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,\nand again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I\nmoved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to\nloosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if\nI was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the\nfear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely\nbound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He\nrepeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that\nhis question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses\nto convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange\nvoice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of\nmen and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled\ninwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a\nprisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs\nof levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to\nme that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,\nin order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had\ncommitted.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the\nquestion.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and\nif you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in\nthis cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the\nproof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was\nlistening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the\nquestion,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me\nto this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you\nguilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did\nnot kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is\nmurdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have\nkilled me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him\nin thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was\nimposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I\nsaid, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are\nmore powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is\nwhy I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will\nprove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in\nwhich,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,\nwhen you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in\nself-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'\nhe said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel\nperhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You\nsay,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if\nyou had not fled from him.''But,' I\nsaid, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have\nbeen your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon\nyou have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as\nyou say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered\nat this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said\npresently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I\nplayed him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that\nthere should be in the world men with such a low order of\nintelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted\ndoggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get\nnothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his\nridiculous defence, I left him.\"\"Do you think,\" asked Doctor Louis, \"that he has any, even the\nremotest belief in the story?\"I cannot believe it,\" replied the magistrate, \"and yet I confess to\nbeing slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which\nmight be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant\nof the cunning of criminals.\"\"Which means,\" said Doctor Louis, \"that it is really not impossible\nthat the man's mind is diseased.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.\"No,\" said the magistrate, in a positive tone, \"I cannot for a moment\nadmit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a\nstick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it\nseemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been\nno attempt at concealment.\"Here is the weapon,\" I cried, \"with which the deed was done!\"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it.\"Here,\" I said, pointing downwards, \"is the direct line of flight\ntaken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror\nas he ran.\"\"It is an improvised weapon,\" said the magistrate, \"cut but lately\nfrom a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with\neffect.\"I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its\nresemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during\nthe watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and\nsaid that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had\nshaped with my knife.\"Do you remember,\" asked the magistrate, \"what you did with it after\nyour suspicions were allayed?\"\"No,\" I replied, \"I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with\nit.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it\nthis morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my\nmind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it\naside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set\nout to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,\nand, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.\"\"It is the only solution,\" said the magistrate.\"So that,\" I said with a sudden thrill of horror, \"I am indirectly\nresponsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been\nresponsible had they used the weapon against those I love!\"We have all happily been spared,\nGabriel,\" he said.We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any\nfurther evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,\nand was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous\nschemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this\nevening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and\nonce, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done\nunconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied\nthat he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had\nentered with respect to my love for his daughter.Indeed it was not\npossible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing\nas mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been\ncontrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning\nLauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a\nfeeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview\nwith the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended\nbelief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to\nhave some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure\nwhich had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the\npermission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further\nadmissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the\nman persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his\nown defence.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.\"I saw him this morning,\" the magistrate said, \"and interrogated him\nwith severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be\ninnocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.\"\"Have you asked him,\" I inquired, \"to give you an account of all that\ntranspired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until\nthe moment he was arrested?\"\"No,\" said the magistrate, \"it did not occur to me to demand of him so\nclose a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should\nhave been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and\nhis invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is\nconscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again\non minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature\nwarns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the\nlowest order of criminals.\"My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial\naccount of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would\nhave extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed\nwhere the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was\nstill bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than\nbefore, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled\nterror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and\nlowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice\nbefore he answered me.\"Why did you not reply to me at once?\"But to this question, although\nI repeated it also twice, he made no response.\"It is useless,\" I said sternly, \"to attempt evasion with me, or to\nthink that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain\na confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it\nfrom you, if you do not give it willingly.\"I understand you,\" he said, keeping his face a", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\"Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because\nyou have a design against me.\"His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my\nintention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden\nin his mind, and I was resolved to get at it.\"What design can I have against you,\" I said, \"of which you need be\nafraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for\nyou.Soon you\nwill be as dead as the man you murdered.\"\"I did not murder him,\" was the strange reply, \"and you know it.\"\"You are playing the same trick upon me that you\nplayed upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as\nunsuccessful with me.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.What further danger can threaten you\nthan the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?\"My body is, perhaps,\" he muttered, \"but not my soul.\"\"Oh,\" I said, in a tone of contempt, \"you believe in a soul.\"\"Yes,\" he replied, \"do not you?\"Not out of my fears, but out\nof my hopes.\"\"I have no hopes and no fears,\" he said.\"I have done wrong, but not\nthe wrong with which I am charged.\"His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to\nmake an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance.\"When I next command you,\" I said, \"you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than\nthe pass to which you have brought it by your crime.\"And still he doggedly repeated, \"I have committed no crime.\"\"Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced\nhim to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His\neyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my\ncompelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.He had no power to\nresist me.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the\nweaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became\ndimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we\nremained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke.\"Relate to me,\" I said, \"all that you know from the time you and the\nman who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the\npresent moment.\"We were poor, both of us,\" Pierre commenced, \"and had been poor all\nour lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain\nmeat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had\nbeen in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when\nwe were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;\nstarvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,\nand so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing\nelse was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;\nwhy should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some\nsixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come\nhere and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a\nrich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We\nhad no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a\nslice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the\nmoney he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us\nto Nerac.We did not hurt the man; a\nknock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to\nthem; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on\nour way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the\nstraightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When\nwe entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money\nleft to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat\ndrinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with\nthe landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place\nwhere we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were\ntalking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach\nmy ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We\nwanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it\nto us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were\nbare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out\nDoctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there\nwould be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past\nmidnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the\ndirection of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have\ncontinued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,\nI had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but\nthe idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I\ndetermined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which\nwe had passed through before we reached the village, and there to\nsleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into\nexecution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I\ndon't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember\nhearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard\nit too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and\nheard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on\ntill we came to the woods, which we entered.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.Down upon the ground we\nthrew ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I\npretended to be.I did not move;\nI even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it\ndeparted, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired\nwith the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us\nwhich would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the\nnight I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.I\nwoke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the\nway.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses\nhad been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he\nlaughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked\nround the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The\nfront of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we\nmade our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a\nhole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our\nbeing heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough\nto enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We\ndid not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our\nsafety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be\nshed.Our plan was to gag and tie\nup any one who interfered with us.My mate and I had had no quarrel;\nwe were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain\ntrue to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked\naway at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,\nfrom the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not\nmove; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when\nI heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club\nwas making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a\nminute, and I turned and saw the demon.I\nslanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,\nfell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,\non my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,\ntearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and\nagain, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,\ntill flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,\nthere was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than\nthe demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking\nme so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag\nmyself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than\nalive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,\nif I don't get it in this!\"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had\nthreatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;\nmurder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him\nin a blacker light.I\nreleased him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before\nme, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had\njust been awakened from sleep.\"You have confessed all,\" I said, meeting cunning with cunning.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and\nin the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his\nlips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my\nhope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer.\"If I have said as much,\" he said, \"it is you who have driven me to\nit, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my\ndestruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is\nfalse from beginning to end.\"So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I\nknew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which\nhas been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at\nthe present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and\nfurnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as\nmy wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a\nkind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been\ngreatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read\nthe record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to\ndiscontinue it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no\nman else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to\ncommence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the\nlabour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I\nshall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should\nbegrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is\nrecorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's\nnature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to\nread these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein\nin myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a\ndisease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself\nagainst myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That\nmy nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed\nto the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of\nlight and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to\nfight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the\nissue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain\nsense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have\noccurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I\nshall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to\nforget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was\ninfluenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting\nwith Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a\nfreshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,\nand it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,\nthrough these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my\nbeloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,\nwhich undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor\nLouis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the\npenalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could\nnot, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have\nbeen vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape\nhis just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to\nrepentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was\nstrange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically\ntowards the criminal.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.\"He laboured, up to the supreme moment,\" said the good priest, in a\ncompassionate tone, \"under the singular hallucination that he was\ngoing before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent\nand apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help\nbeing shaken in my belief that he was guilty.\"\"Not in the sense,\" said Father Daniel, \"that the unhappy man would\nhave had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether\ntoo incredulous;

Markham seem entitled to more notice and commendation.\"I have given extracts from his \"English Husbandman,\" to shew his love\nfor flowers.The same attachment is visible where he enumerates them in\nhis \"Country House-wive's Garden.\"--By the bye, though I have stated\nthis last work to be his, it surely appears to have been written by W.\nLawson.I merely now give the following extract from Markham's \"English\nHouse-Wife:\"\n\n\"Next vnto this sanctity and holinesse of life, it is meet that our\nEnglish hous-wife be a woman of great modesty and temperance as well\ninwardly as outwardly; inwardly, as in her behauiour and cariage towards\nher husband, wherein she shall shunne all violence of rage, passion, and\nhumour, coueting lesse to direct then to be directed, appearing euer\nvnto him pleasant, amiable, and delightfull, and though occasion,\nmishaps, or the misgouernement of his will may induce her to contrary\nthoughts, yet vertuously to suppresse them, and with a mild sufferance\nrather to call him home from his error, then with the strength of anger\nto abate the least sparke of his euill, calling in her mind that euill\nand vncomely language is deformed though vttered euen to seruants, but\nmost monstrous and vgly when it appeares before the presence of a\nhusband: outwardly, as in her apparrell and diet, both which she shall\nproportion according to the competency of her husband's estate and\ncalling, making her circle rather strait then large, for it is a rule if\nwe extend to the vttermost, we take away increase, if we goe a hayre\nbreadth beyond, we enter into consumption: but if we preserue any part,\nwe build strong forts against the aduersaries of fortune, prouided that\nsuch preseruation be honest and conscionable: for a lauish prodigality\nis brutish, so miserable couetuousnesse is hellish.Let therefore the\nhus-wives garments be comly and strong, made aswel to preserue the\nhealth, as adorne the person, altogether without toyish garnishes, or\nthe glosse of light colours, and as far from the vanity of new and\nfantastick fashions, as neere to the comly imitations of modest\nmatrons.\"I must give an extract from his \"Country Contentements,\" as he reminds\nus of Shakspeare's lines on the tuneable cry of hounds; for Markham\ndwells on their sweetness of cry--\"their deepe solemne mouthes--their\nroaring and loud ringing mouthes, which must beare the counter-tenor,\nthen some hollow plaine sweete mouthes--a deep-mouthed dog--a couple or\ntwo of small singing beagles, which as small trebles, may warble amongst\nthem: the cry will be a great deale the more sweeter--the hollow deepe\nmouth--the loud clanging mouthe--deepe flewed, such as for the most part\nyour _Shropshire_ and pure _Worcestershire_ dogs are--the louder and\npleasanter your cry will be, especially if it be in sounding tall woods,\nor under the echo of rocks--and not above one couple of roarers, which\nbeing heard but now and then, as at the opening or hitting of a scent,\nwill give much sweetnesse to the solemns, and gravenesse of the cry, and\nthe musick thereof will bee much more delightfull to the eares of every\nbeholder.\"Page 123.--The memory of Pope has perhaps never been more affectionately\nhonoured (nor that of Lord Mendip, who so zealously preserved every part\nof the house and garden at Twickenham) than in the glowing and tender\nlines of De Lille, in his poem of _Les Jardins_.The vignette in my title-page, and that at page 84, are two of those\nneat decorations which so profusely embellish the Encyclopaedia of\nGardening.A.\n\n   Abercrombie, 153\n\n   Addison, xxviii., xxxii., 49, 115\n     ---- reflections on the tombs, 117\n\n   Age of gardeners and horticulturists, 81\n\n   Alison, Dr.xxxviii., 71, 120, 211\n\n   Anderson, 69, 175\n\n   Ardenne, J.

he admitted to\nit none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal\ngentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the\nduchess of Sully.He often went into his gardens, and passing through a\nlittle covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen\ngarden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully\nhas caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a\nterrace on the other side of the garden.It was then the taste to have a\ngreat many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of\ntrees, or palisadoes.Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,\namused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and\non the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which\nsurrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty\ntrees.There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had\ncastles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to\nwhich he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to\nthe public good.At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs\nalong the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled\nwith groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works.He embellished\n_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,\nand with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,\nwhich he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire.He\nerected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,\nof which the gardens are full.He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle\nd'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces.\"These gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby\nGooche:\n\n   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,\n   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._\n\nThat fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own\nstatement of his visit to the Duke d'Aumale's, at Anet, near Ivry,\n(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--\"Joy\nanimated the countenance of Madame d'Aumale the moment she perceived me.She gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and\nled me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make\nAnet a most enchanting place.\"One may justly apply to Sully, what he\nhimself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: \"A man for whom eloquence and\ngreat sentiments had powerful charms.\"I had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of\nthe superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV.and during\nthe succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with\nplates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;\nwith extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works\nmay have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,\nmight have been these two lines from Rapin,\n\n   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears\n   With numerous gardens stored._\n\nPerhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to\nhave monopolized our Shakspeare's line,--\"I love _France_ so well, that\nI will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine.\"Isaac Walton gives the following lines from a translation of a German\npoet, which makes one equally fond of England:\n\n   We saw so many woods, and princely bowers,\n   Sweet fields, brave palaces, and stately towers,\n   _So many gardens dress'd with curious care_,\n   That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.[3] The Encyclopaedia of Gardening has a rich page (35) devoted to Le\nNotre.thus records his genius and his grand and\nmagnificent efforts:--\"Ce grand homme fut choisi pour decorer les\njardins du chateau de Vau-le-Vicomte.Il en fit un sejour enchanteur,\npar les ornamens nouveaux, pleins de magnificence, qu'il y prodigua.On\nvit alors, pour la premiere fois, des portiques, des berceaux, des\ngrottes, des traillages, des labyrinths, &c. embellir varier le\nspectacle des jardins.Le Roi, temoin des ces merveilles, lui donna la\ndirection de tous ses parcs.Il embellit par son art, Versailles,\nTrianon, et il fit a St.Germain cette fameuse terrasse qu'on voit\ntoujours avec une nouvelle admiration.Les jardins de Clagny, de\nChantilly, de St.Cloud, de Meudon, de Sceaux, le parterre du Tibre, et\nles canaux qui ornent ce lieu champetre a Fontainbleau, sont encore son\nouvrage.Il demanda a faire voyage de l'Italie, dans l'esperance\nd'acquerir de nouvelles connoissances; mais son genie createur l'avoit\nconduit a la perfection.Il ne vit rien de comparable a ce qu'il avoit\nfait en France.\"Notwithstanding the above just and high tribute, I have no hesitation in\nsaying, that it is not superior to the magic picture which the\nfascinating pen of Mad.de Sevigne has drawn of le Notre's creative\ngenius, in her letter of Aug.Many others of this charming\nwoman's letters breathe her love of gardens.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.thus speaks of the Pere Rapin:--\"A un genie\nheureux, a un gout sur, il joignoit une probite exacte, un coeur droit,\nun caractere aimable et des moeurs douces.Il etoit naturellement\nhonnete, et il s'etoit encore poli dans le commerce des grands.Parmi\nses differentes Poesies Latines, on distingue le Poeme des Jardins.C'est son chef d'oeuvre;

Price, pays a very high compliment to this exquisite\npoem, in p.i. of his Essays, terming it full of the justest\ntaste, and most brilliant imagery.[8] In the Earl of Harcourt's garden, at Nuneham, in Oxfordshire, (laid\nout in some parts under the eye and fine taste of the poet Mason), on a\nbust of Rousseau are these lines:\n\n   Say, is thy honest heart to virtue warm?Approach, behold this venerable form;\n     'Tis Rousseau!There are attractive pages in this little volume of the Viscount's,\nwhich would have interested either Shenstone, or Gainsborough,\nparticularly the pages 59, 143, 145, and 146, (of Mr.Malthus's\ntranslation), for in these pages \"we feel all the truth and energy of\nnature.\"131, will enable the reader to judge of\nthe writer's style:--\"When the cool evening sheds her soft and\ndelightful tints, and leads on the hours of pleasure and repose, then is\nthe universal reign of sublime harmony.It is at this happy moment that\nClaude has caught the tender colouring, the enchanting calm, which\nequally attaches the heart and the eyes; it is then that the fancy\nwanders with tranquillity over distant scenes.Masses of trees through\nwhich the light penetrates, and under whose foliage winds a pleasant\npath; meadows, whose mild verdure is still softened by the transparent\nshades of the evening; crystal waters which reflect all the near objects\nin their pure surface; mellow tints, and distances of blue vapour; such\nare in general the objects best suited to a western exposure.The sun,\nbefore he leaves the horizon, seems to blend earth and sky, and it is\nfrom sky that evening views receive their greatest beauty.The\nimagination dwells with delight upon the exquisite variety of soft and\npleasing colours, which embellishes the clouds and the distant country,\nin this peaceful hour of enjoyment and contemplation.\"[9] He was enthusiastically devoted to the cultivation of his gardens,\nwhich exhibited enchanting scenery, umbrageous walks, and magnificent\nwater-falls.When thus breathing the pure air of rural life, the\nblood-stained monsters of 1793 seized him in his garden, and led him to\nthe scaffold.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to\nthe bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby\nrendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality\ngenerally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire\nsupport.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases\nthe amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a\nresult due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it\nand the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper\nby employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage\nthus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative\ninefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an\naverage of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference\nof 10 deg.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the\npractical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of\ngrapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only\nbe determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,\neither under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel\nthe full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their\nutility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental\nvarieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are\nscarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At\nany rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to\nneutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the\nbest of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen\nout of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to\nnothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much\nappreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor\nculture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under\nglass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords\nsome excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid\nreason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a\ngeneral way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and\nchecking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to\nget the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes\nwould often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average\ntemperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical\ncontrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average\nwarmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure\nthe grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor\nculture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now\npracticable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying\nmildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting\nadministered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for\nthe season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving\nrains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and\nautumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these\nglass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening\nof pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being\nemployed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and\nshapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing\nthe maturity of the fruits", "question": "Where is Daniel?

Pifre, who has devoted much\nlabor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea.A company has now come\nto his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes\nat a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them.It is\nevident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be\nheated in thirty or forty minutes.A portable apparatus could boil two\nand one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying\nby distillation or ebullition six or eight men.The apparatus can be\neasily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the\nworst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is\ninsured.M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published\nan interesting volume on the invention.I was able yesterday to verify\nhis statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee\nmade--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of\nfuel.The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it\nis it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field\ngood water and to cook his food rapidly.The invention is of especial\nimportance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is\nsettled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission\nforthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report\nimmediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen\nfighting abroad for their country.I may, of course, be mistaken, but\na commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest\ndelay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London\nTimes_.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]By PROFESSOR L.

HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been\nof inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,\nand the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the\nneedle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate\ndetermination of permanent boundary lines have proven very\nunsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and\neven death.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to\ndispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle\nin surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of\ntraversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a\ngreater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are\ngenerally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be\nreadily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application\nin practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the\ntrue meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of\nlatitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true\nmeridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to\nthese difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,\ninstrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the\nprobable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time\nmay be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is\nreferred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes\nlost in \"confusion worse confounded,\" and gives up in despair, settling\ndown to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is\nthe best after all, even if not the most accurate.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I\nhave thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the\nmethod of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently\nclear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make\nuse of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with\nthe\n\n\nDEFINITIONS.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all\ncelestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the\nearth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing\nthrough the axis.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.All meridians are therefore north and south lines\npassing through the poles.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at\nthe pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a\nbearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are\nobliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,\nand correct the observation according to its angular distance from the\nmeridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is\ngenerally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,\nin an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.19' 13\",[1] making the revolution in\n23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above\nthe pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the\nlatter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass\nthrough the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former\nis called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,\nor at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too\ncomplicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or\nlower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this\ninvolves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude\nof the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and\nmoreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to\nthe place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,\nan error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would\nintroduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,\nhowever, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,\nthat is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the\nerror of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be\ninappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make\nthe observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be\ngiven.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the\nrelative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,\nand Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is\nhorizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the\nlatter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will\nbe necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be\nturned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.This angle,\ncalled the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the\nobserver, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be\ncomputed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his\n_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the\ncelestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;\nthen N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the\nlatitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle\nof the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the\nlatitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,\npreceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called\nthe _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a\nplane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the\nnormal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,\nhence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith\nand nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object\nis its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical\ncircle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the\ndifference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith\ndistance_, or _co-altitude_.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane\nthrough the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the\nhorizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at\n90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the\nposition of any object with reference to the observer's place.The\nlatter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude\nreferred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,\nand the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to\nthe latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,\nin which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1\nwill be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,\nand Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C\nQ1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be\nsubtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the\nlatitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either\nabove or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for\nrefraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its\n_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for\nordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with\nsufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction\nis _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by\nlooking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the\nobserver's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07\",\nshould be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 00\", leaving 40 deg.37' 53\" for the\nlatitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the\nlatitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the\nrequired azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical\ntriangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the\nnorth pole, and S is Polaris.In this triangle we have given the polar\ndistance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13\"; the angle at S = 90 deg.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.; and the distance Z\nP, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from\nwhich, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the\nfollowing table:\n\n       AZIMUTH TABLE FOR POINTS BETWEEN 26 deg.LATTITUDES\n ___________________________________________________________________\n|      |         |          |         |         |         |         |\n| Year |   26 deg.|\n|______|_________|__________|_________|_________|_________|_________|\n|      |         |          |         |         |         |         |\n|      |  deg.

made at\nintervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights.The\nfirst is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit\nwith vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,\netc.[1] Having \"set up\" over the point through which it is proposed to\nestablish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and\nAlioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached\nlevel, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical\narc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its\n_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as\nit moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest\npart of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant\nto hold the \"bull's eye\" so as to reflect enough light down the tube\nfrom the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the\nstar, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in\nthis position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_\nwire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it \"rides\" along this\nwire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the\nvertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the\n_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by\n2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the\ncomplement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has\nsufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at\nits highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the\nhorizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another\nreading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the\n_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two\npointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting\nfrom it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the\nrefraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must\nnow wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,\nor may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the\nmeantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his\ndate and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made\non the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so\nthat when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be\nbrought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by\nmeans of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]\n\nIt is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of\nobservation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star\nmay be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at\nthe surveyor's convenience.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.It is always well to check the accuracy of\nthe work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in\npermanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not\nplaced near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,\nthe magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting\nan instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the\nneedle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is\nwest, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and\n_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the\nsun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of\ntime as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,\ncompared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by\ntaking the difference between the local lime of this and any other\nplace, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can\nreadily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of\nfirst contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and\ntake the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF

Paris have just been\nenriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of\nbird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their\ndesiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity\nof naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal\nfeathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the\ngalleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at\nthe museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux\nParalleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a\nfew years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the\nPhasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not\ntill 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural\nHistory, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out\nthe peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the\nMuseum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves\nnothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of\nVerreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose\ntail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that\nthe museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an\nordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named\n_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of\nthe family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat\nhas given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common\nArgus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not\nformed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very\nlong feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists\nof twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with\nocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is\nadorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its\nsystem of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its\nbody are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,\nthen, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,\nin the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,\nafter a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name\n_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for\nthat of _Rheinardi_.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which\nbelong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be\nlarger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft\non the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest\n0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.The feathers of this crest are\nbrown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy\nfeathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "The upper part of the body is\nof a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole\ndotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are\nfound on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become\nelongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite\nregularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail\nand on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous\nblotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface\nof the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,\nare disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.This\nsimilitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the\ndistinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many\nother Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are\nconsiderably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,\nall spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length\nfrom the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of\ninsertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to\na sharp point.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and\nwidth which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to\ndescribe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil.The\nbeak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,\nexactly resembles that of the arguses.It is slightly inflated at the\nbase, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval\nform.In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet\nand legs, is of a dark rose-color.The legs are quite long and are\ndestitute of spurs.They terminate in front in three quite delicate\ntoes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is\ninserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking.This\nmagnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored\nby Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south\nof Hue.--_La Nature_.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAIDENHAIR TREE.The Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,\nis not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the\nmost interesting.Few persons would at first sight take it to be a\nConifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,\nto that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but\ndistinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous\nradiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the\nlarch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow\ncolor before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but\ngenerally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we\nbelieve, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other\ntrees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies\nfortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,\nit is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or\nother unexplored districts, into China and Japan.Though now a solitary\nrepresentative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the\ncoal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,\nProfessor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty\nspecies and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through\nthe northern hemisphere.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least\ncertain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it\nbe the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and\ndescribed by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as\nto the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.Julia\nBelmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own\nright, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker's\nclerk, reputed \"fast,\" was surprising, but a woman's taste in such a\ncase is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the\nhatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and\nJulia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred\nthousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her\nconsent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her\nissue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position\nimmediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business.\"Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am\nout of business I can devote myself more entirely to her.\"This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,\nindulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,\nto the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to\nill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted\naway, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife's\nproperty.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her\nchild's welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to\nthis unreasonable demand.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.\"You shall have the income, John,\" she said--\"I will keep none back; but\nthe principal must be kept for Althea.\"\"You care more for the brat than you do for me,\" he muttered.\"You know how the money would go,\nJohn.\"That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this,\" he said,\nangrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.\"\"I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.\"\"It is a strange way--to oppose your husband's wishes.Women ought never\nto be trusted with money--they don't know how to take care of it.\"\"You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted\none hundred thousand dollars.\"\"It was bad luck in investments,\" he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not\nvery profitable.\"\"Do you mean to insult me, madam?\"\"I am only telling the sad truth, John.\"She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent\nthis outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all\nrestraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his\ntreatment became so bad that Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.Hartley consented to institute\nproceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of\npneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the\ncare of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her\nto find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had\ncome into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and\nfollow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered\nmaledictions upon her.\"I'll have the child yet, if only to spite her,\" he muttered, between\nhis teeth.\"I won't allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh\nand blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her.\"He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist\nhim in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,\nbut often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker's he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had\nbelonged to the same club as himself in years past.By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.\"\"I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.\"\"Are you sure it was my\nchild?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.\"Of course; I used to see it often, you know.\"Don't _you_ know where she lives?\"\"No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently\nwas suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,\nand was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.\"She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.\"\"So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?\"\"Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands,\" said\nHartley, plausibly.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.She is living\nhere in London, doubtless on my little girl's fortune.\"John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich\nwoman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was\nbelieved by his acquaintance.\"This is bad treatment, Hartley,\" he said, in a tone of sympathy.\"Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her.\"This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his\nsearch, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into\nher hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had\nno difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her\nco-operation.\"If it's no harm you mean my\nmissus----\"\n\n\"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand\na father's wish to see his child, my dear girl.\"\"Indeed, I think it's cruel to keep her from you, sir.\"\"Then look over your mistress' papers and try to obtain the street and\nnumber where she is boarding in New York.\"Of course you have, sir,\" said the girl, readily.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan's address, and communicated\nit to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York.\"I'll secure the child,\" he said to himself, exultingly, \"and then my\nsweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back.\"All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan\nand his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring\nsuspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,\nluckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,\nand furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who\nwent in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated\nto gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but\nalways accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there\nwould be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits'\nend.Mordaunt chanced to need some small\narticle necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might\nindeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan's,\nwhich he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to\ndisappoint him.\"My child,\" she said, \"I find I must go out a little while.\"\"I want to buy some braid to bind Dan's vest.He will want to wear it in\nthe morning.\"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the\ndirection of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she\noften traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,\nfor the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five\nminutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver.\"There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe.\"She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession\nof her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not\nknow me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel\nanxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians.\"I've got a little girl of my own, and I understand\nyour feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew\nup before Mrs.Brown's door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the\nbell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the\nbell.\"A lady lives here with a little girl,\" he said, quickly.\"Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea.\"Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into\nmy house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.\"\"I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can't wait.Will you bring the\nlittle girl down at once?\"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs.\"Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea,\" she said.\"She's hurt, and she can't come, and she has sent for you.\"But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?\"\"There's a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been\ntaken to his home.\"I'm afraid mamma's been killed,\" she said.\"No, she hasn't, or how could she send for you?\"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl\nand hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt\nwould come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the\nfulfillment of his plans.\"So she calls this woman mamma,\" said Hartley to himself.\"Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the\ncarriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her.\"He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside\nher, ordered the cabman to drive on.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry.\"She was crossing the street,\" said Hartley, \"when she got in the way of\na carriage and was thrown down and run over.\"The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and\nshe is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days.\"John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the\nservant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in\ntruth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had\nmodified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the\nchild precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old\nenough to be suspicious.\"Not far from here,\" answered Hartley, evasively.\"No, not my own mamma, but I call her so.\"I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon's work,\" said Hartley to\nhimself.\"It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in\nbetter business than poisoning my child's mind against me.\"he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly\nto occupy the child's mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of\nthe lapse of time.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.\"Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party\nto-night.\"\"I am glad of that,\" thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn't come home\ntill supper time.\"Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea\nbecame restless.\"I don't see how mamma could have gone so far.\"\"The cab-driver lost the way, and that has\ndelayed us.\"Meanwhile they reached the South\nFerry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their\ncrossing the water.After a moment's thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into\nwhich he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\"Drink, my dear,\" he said; \"it will do you good.\"It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste.\"It is a cordial,\" answered Hartley.\"I feel very sleepy,\" said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already\nbegun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in\nvain.\"There will be no further trouble,\" thought Hartley.\"When she wakes up\nit will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection\nwould have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by\nsuch means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or\nnatural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping\nchild as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes\nupon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled\noutlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby\nand neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name\n\n\n         DONOVAN'S\n\n     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of\nthem thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at\nsmall tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and\nwas suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others\nengaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,\nand unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man\nwith reddish whiskers, a beard of a week's growth, and but one\nserviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There\nwere two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the\nglance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from\nhis mouth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.\"I have a job for her and for you.\"I want her taken care of for a few\ndays or weeks.\"\"Shure, the old woman isn't a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl\nshould be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than\nthis.\"I have little time for explanation, but I may\ntell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get\nhold of her money.\"\"Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my\nown child.Is there no way of getting up stairs\nexcept by passing through the bar-room?\"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he\nclambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his\nbetter-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,\nevidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed\nfrom a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband's companions.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.\"Shure, Hugh, who is it you're bringin' here?\"\"It's a child, old woman, that you're to have the care of.\"\"Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.\"\"Will I get the money, or Hugh?\"\"You shall have half, Bridget,\" said her husband.\"I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,\"\nsaid Hartley.\"Here's a week's pay in advance,\" and he took out two\nfive-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs.\"I'll take care of her,\" said she, readily.\"Shure that's a quare name.You can call her any name you like,\" said\nHartley, indifferently.\"Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there\nmay be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion.\"Donovan, and she opened the door of a small\nroom, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise\nshe might have made a fuss, for she doesn't know me to be her father.\"Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do\nto let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from\nwhom I have taken her.\"\"Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will\ncommunicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the\ntrack, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of\nsecurity.\"I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave\nyou to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes.\"I'll trate her like my own child,\" said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,\nred-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the\nchild as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no\ntrouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door.\"It's a queer place to leave a child,\" thought he, as his experienced\neye took in the features of the place.\"It appears to be a liquor\nsaloon.However, it is none of\nmy business.\"Driver, I am ready,\" said Hartley.\"Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square.\"Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and\ngave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation.\"I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms,\" he said.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.\"She will\nfind that she can't stand between me and my child.If she will make it\nworth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that\nmy interests are secured.\"The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a\nletter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand\ndollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of\nwhich he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further\nmolestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in\nsound sleep till eight o'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,\nand she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in\nsurprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper\nand dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs.\"I want mamma,\" answered the child, still more frightened.\"Shure I'm your ma, child.\"\"No, you are not,\" said Althea.I sent you away to board, but\nyou've come home to live with your ma.\"You are a bad woman,\" returned the child,\nready to cry.\"It's a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she's lyin'.\"\"Don't you go\non talkin' that way, but get right up, or you sha'n't have any\nbreakfast.\"\"Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!\"\"Dress yourself, and I'll see about it,\" said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place\nshe found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had\nonce belonged to a daughter of Mrs.\"Those clothes are not mine,\" said Althea.\"I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,\"\nsaid Mrs.\"I won't put this dress on,\" said the child, indignantly.\"Then you'll have to lay abed all day, and won't get nothing to eat,\"\nsaid the woman.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.\"Shure you're a quare child to ask your own mother's name.\"That's a quare name intirely.I'm afraid\nyou're gone crazy, Katy.\"Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,\nand that this red-faced woman was her mother?She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that\nthere was any connection between them?\"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.\"\"Well, you're livin' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.\"\"Shure I shouldn't have sent you away from me to have you come home and\ndeny your own mother.\"\"Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?\"asked Althea,\nafter a pause.\"If you're a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I'll give you\nsome breakfast.\"With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments\nof the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror\nwith a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in\norder to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set\nthe table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another.\"Come here, little gal,\" he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a\nman to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a\nfairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a\ncreature.\"I don't want to,\" said the child, trembling.\"Go to your father, Katy,\" said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if\nfascinated at his one eye.\"Yes, come to your pa,\" said Donovan, jeeringly.\"I like little\ngals--'specially when they're my own.\"\"Yes, you be, and don't you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,\nthinking it a good joke.\"Well, it'll do after breakfast,\" he said.\"Sit up, child, and we'll see\nwhat the ould woman has got for us.\"Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little\nbread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house\nwas responsible.When the meal was over she said:\n\n\"Now, will you take me back to New York?\"\"You are not going back at all,\" said Hugh.\"You are our little girl,\nand you are going to live with us.\"Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they\ncould be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was

market,\" answered Mrs.\"Shure, if you'll be a good gal, I'll give you all the pleasure\nI can.\"Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged\nsun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the\nhouse, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her\nsupplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child's curiosity on\nher way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her\nsorrow.\"Shure it's my little Katy,\" said the woman, with a significant wink\nwhich prevented further questioning.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become\nafraid of her new guardians.She felt\nsure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was\nDan to know where she was.The poor child's lips quivered, and she could\nhardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea's disappearance that he felt it\nnecessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her\nrecovery.\"I'll find her, mother,\" he said, confidently.\"Do not lie awake\nthinking of her, for it won't do any

Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how\nthe little girl had been spirited away.\"So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?\"\"Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?\"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your\nmother broke her leg, and I didn't think to look at him sharp.\"\"You can tell if he was an old man or a young one.\"He was betwixt and betwane.\"Now, what kind of a carriage was it?\"\"Jist a hack like them at the square.\"\"No; shure they all look alike to me.\"Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to\nbe of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and\ninterview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was\nabsent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying\na gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between\nEighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His\ncourage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that\na child had actually been brought there.\"May I see the child, madam?\"\"If you like,\" answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea's age.\"It is a little girl I am inquiring after,\" he said.\"I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought,\" said Dan\nto himself.\"I am on a false scent, that is sure.\"When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been\nunobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve\nas he noted our hero's inquiries.\"You may be a smart boy, my lad,\" he said to himself, \"but I don't think\nyou'll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint.\"He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:\n\n\"Are you in search of your little sister?\"\"I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite\nthe house in which you board.\"\"Did you see Althea carried away?\"\"Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from

I will note it down.\"John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile.\"My dear young friend,\" he said to himself, \"it goes to my heart to\ndeceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of\nyour search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive\nintelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look\nafter you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while\nyou are wandering about.\"John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait\nthree weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had\none source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet\nVernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be\nseriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse\nto the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He\ndid not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of\nsuccess should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his\nchild's expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western\nadventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley's want of\ncharacter, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a\nhazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some\ngenuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of\nshares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a\nhundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a\ncorresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the\novertures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious\ninvestigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and\nhow well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was\nso satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in\ntrain.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful\naccomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously\nraised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man\nfrom Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as\ncollateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without\na doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars\nbetween them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.And no man can imagine that I herein commit the fault\nwhich the Logicians call a _Circle_; for experience rendring the\ngreatest part of these effects most certain, the causes whence I deduce\nthem serve not so much to prove, as to explain them; but on the\ncontrary, they are those which are proved by them.Neither named I them\nSuppositions, that it might be known that I conceive my self able to\ndeduce them from those first Truths which I have before discovered: But\nthat I would not expresly do it to crosse certain spirits, who imagine\nthat they know in a day al what another may have thought in twenty\nyeers, as soon as he hath told them but two or three words; and who are\nso much the more subject to erre, and less capable of the Truth, (as\nthey are more quick and penetrating) from taking occasion of erecting\nsome extravagant Philosophy on what they may beleeve to be my\nPrinciples, and lest the fault should be attributed to me.For as for\nthose opinions which are wholly mine, I excuse them not as being new,\nbecause that if the reasons of them be seriously considered, I assure my\nself, they will be found so plain, and so agreeable to common sense,\nthat they will seem less extraordinary and strange then any other which\nmay be held on the same Subjects.Neither do I boast that I am the first\nInventor of any of them; but of this indeed, that I never admitted any\nof them, neither because they had, or had not been said by others, but\nonly because Reason perswaded me to them.If Mechanicks cannot so soon put in practise the Invention which is set\nforth in the Opticks, I beleeve that therefore men ought not to condemn\nit; forasmuch as skill and practice are necessary for the making and\ncompleating the Machines I have described; so that no circumstance\nshould be wanting.I should no less wonder if they should succeed at\nfirst triall, then if a man should learn in a day to play excellently\nwell on a Lute, by having an exact piece set before him.And if I write\nin French, which is the language of my Country, rather then in Latin,\nwhich is that of my Tutors, 'tis because I hope such who use their meer\nnaturall reason, wil better judge of my opinions, then those who only\nbeleeve in old Books.And for those who joyn a right understanding with\nstudy, (who I only wish for my Judges) I assure my self, they will not\nbe so partiall to the Latin, as to refuse to read my reasons because I\nexpresse them in a vulgar tongue.To conclude, I will not speak here in particular of the progresse I\nhoped to make hereafter in Learning; Nor engage my self by any promise\nto the Publick, which I am not certain to perform.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.But I shall onely\nsay, That I am resolved to employ the remainder of my life in no other\nthing but the study to acquire some such knowledge of Nature as may\nfurnish us with more certain rules in Physick then we hitherto have had:\nAnd that my inclination drives me so strongly from all other kind of\ndesignes, chiefly from those which cannot be profitable to any, but by\nprejudicing others; that if any occasion obliged me to spend my time\ntherein, I should beleeve I should never succeed therein: which I here\ndeclare, though I well know it conduceth not to make me considerable in\nthe world;

and one with Roderick and his clan\nagainst the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very\nslight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the\nother, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the\nlove story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the\nbeginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a\nsimple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to\n      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which\n      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the\n      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition\n      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of\n      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of\n      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the\n      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess\n      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the\nbeginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with\nthe problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most\ncases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses\nthe details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of\norder used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find\nand follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness\nof his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls\nin the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must\nleave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and\nelemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the\nspecial topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon\ndescription because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs\nof the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.\n\nI.

then a\nlarge burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the\nreluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him.\"I got him for you, sir,\" announced the officer proudly, to the\nastonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to\nstruggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to\nthe bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer\nand pressed him jealously to his breast.\"I don't understand,\" he said,\ngazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate\nJimmy.\"I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.\"\"I KNEW it,\" exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at\nJimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred\nturned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing\ndefiance into the officer's threatening eyes.This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out\ninto the night.\"\"Then you've had trouble with him before?\"He\nstudied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought\na confirmed \"baby-snatcher\" to justice.\"I've had a little trouble myself,\" declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved\nto make a clean breast of it.\"I'm not asking about your troubles,\" interrupted the officer savagely,\nand Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on\nhis collar.\"Go ahead, sir,\" said the officer to Alfred.\"Well,\" began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, \"he was out\nwith my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him\na second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the\nfire-escape.I don't know what to say,\" he finished weakly.\"_I_ do,\" exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,\n\"and I'll say it.\"And before Jimmy could get further,\nAlfred resumed with fresh vehemence.\"He's supposed to be a friend of mine,\" he explained to the officer, as\nhe nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy.\"He was all right when I left him\na few months ago.\"\"You'll think I'm all right again,\" shouted Jimmy, trying to get free\nfrom the officer, \"before I've finished telling all I----\"\n\n\"That won't help any,\" interrupted the officer firmly, and with another\ntwist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most\ncivil manner, \"What shall I do with him, sir?\"\"I don't know,\" said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject\nfor a straight jacket.\"It's absurd,\" cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter\ndespair of ever disentangling the present complication without\nultimately losing Alfred, \"you're all absurd,\" she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, \"what do you\nmean?\"\"It's a joke,\" said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke\nlay.\"If you had any sense you could see it.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.\"I DON'T see it,\" said Alfred, with hurt dignity.\"Neither do I,\" said Jimmy, with boiling resentment.\"Can you call it a joke,\" asked Alfred, incredulously, \"to have our\nboy----\" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion\npiece to this youngster.he exclaimed, \"our other\nboy----\" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified\nface to Zoie.\"Now, Alfred,\" pleaded Zoie, \"don't get excited; he's all right.\"Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as\nusual he was the source of an inspiration for her.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.\"Jimmy never cared for the other one,\" she said, \"did you, Jimmy?\"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command.\"Wait,\" he said,\nthen he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other\nboy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair\nstraight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's\nreturn with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to\nappear on the threshold with one babe on each arm.\"Here they are,\" she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight\nof the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied\nhand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,\n\"THOSE aren't MINE,\" he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better\nto say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,\nwhose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and\nshe proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her.\"OURS, dear,\" she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and\nfeeling sure that his mind was about to give way.\"Why--why--why,\" stuttered Zoie, \"THAT'S the JOKE.\"echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but\nsuch.\"Yes,\" added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their\ntemporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, \"what IS there to tell?\"\"Why, you see,\" said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each\nelaboration of Zoie's lie, \"we didn't dare to break it to you too\nsuddenly.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on\nhis face.\"So,\" concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, \"we\nasked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT.\"Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible\nthat she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.\"Yes,\" confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, \"we wanted you to get used\nto the idea gradually.\"He was afraid to allow his mind to accept\ntoo suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy\nover-power him.\"You--you--do--don't mean----\" he stuttered.\"Yes, dear,\" sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a\nlanguid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight.\"Give\nthem to me,\" he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants\nsavagely from her arms.\"Give me ALL of them, ALL of them.\"He clasped\nthe three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the\nunsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to\nhers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her\nunmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his\nheart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind\nin general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated\nthat bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which\nJimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled\nJimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a\nloud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young\nfriend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred\nveered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in\ntime to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young\nfather.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred\nsuddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other.\"Well,\" said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,\nand feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his\nshort-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, \"if this is all a\njoke, I'll let the woman go.\"\"The woman,\" repeated Alfred; \"what woman?\"\"I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape,\" explained the\nofficer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly.\"I thought\nshe might be an accomplice.\"His manner was\nbecoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of\neach new infant.\"Don't be silly, Alfred,\" snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was\nmaking such an idiot of himself.\"Oh, that's it,\" said Alfred, with a wise nod of", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "\"You're all in it,\" he exclaimed, flattered to think\nthat they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many\nof them to deceive him.\"Yes,\" assented Jimmy sadly, \"we are all 'in it.'\"\"Well, she's a great actress,\" decided Alfred, with the air of a\nconnoisseur.\"She sure is,\" admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt\nhis reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him.\"She put up a\nphoney story about the kid being hers,\" he added.\"But I could tell she\nwasn't on the level.Good-night, sir,\" he called to Alfred, and ignoring\nJimmy, he passed quickly from the room.I'll\nbe down later and fix things up with you.\"Again Alfred gave his whole\nattention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed\necstatically into the three small faces below his.\"Much too much,\" agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the\ncouch in his customary attitude of gloom.\"You were right not to break it to me too suddenly,\" said Alfred, and\nwith his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch\nby Jimmy's side.\"You're a cute one,\" he continued to Jimmy, who was\nedging away from the three mites with aversion.In the absence of any\nanswer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, \"Isn't he a cute one, dear?\"\"Oh, yes, VERY,\" answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at\nself restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door.\"If you women are done with me,\" he said, \"I'll clear out.\"exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself\nbetween his old friend and the door.\"What a chance,\" and he laughed\nboisterously.\"You're not going to get out of my sight this night,\" he\ndeclared.\"I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.\"\"So am I,\" assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot\nwhere his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted.\"A man needs someone around,\" he declared, \"when he's going through a\nthing like this.I need all of you, all of you,\" and with his eyes he\nembraced the weary circle of faces about him.\"I feel as though I could\ngo out of my head,\" he explained and with that he began tucking the\nthree small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'\n\n\"You act as though you WERE out of your head,\" she commented, but Alfred\ndid not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing\nthree babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show\nsome resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again\nsimultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII\n\nAnnoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,\nAlfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into\nthe room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly\nfor the side of Zoie's bed.\"If you plaze, mum,\" she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her\nhands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed.\"'Scuse me for comin' right in\"--Maggie was breathing hard--\"but me\nmother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from\nwork, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum.\"cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward\nAlfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing\ninterest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, \"your father is mad about babies?\"\"It's all right, dear,\" interrupted Zoie nervously; \"you see,\" she\nwent on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, \"this is our\nwasherwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it\nmade the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.\"\"Oh,\" said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so\neasily disposed of.\"If you please, mum,\" she objected, \"it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that\nall his heirs were boys, \"No wonder your pa's angry.Come now,\" he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and\nregarding her indulgently, \"you go straight home and tell your father\nthat what HE needs is BOYS.\"\"Well, of course, sir,\" answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that\nAlfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her\nparents, \"if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money\nback,\" and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel\npetticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, \"what money?\"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly.\"The money for the wash, dear,\" she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, \"who talks\nof money at such a time as this?\"And taking a ten dollar bill from his\npocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying\nto return to him the original purchase money.\"Here,\" he said to the\nastonished girl, \"you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to\nhim for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it.\"This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,\nor at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was\nadding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,\nbut she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such\na \"grand 'hoigh\" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no\ndoubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred\nundecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand.\"I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir,\" she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her\nred little fingers over the bill, \"he's GOT to like it.Now you run along,\" he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her\ntoward the door, \"and tell him what I say.\"\"Yes, sir,\" murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly\nunder Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high\nbacked chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's\nbeing able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,\nJimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their\nway with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into\nspace.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing\nbecame laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of\nMaggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the\nside of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his\near.\"Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,\nsir.\"He studied the young person at his\nelbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had\nhappened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently\nMaggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy\nthought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand\nfall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy\nbegan to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the\nharder.\"Go away,\" whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he\nsaid, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,\nAlfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the\nprompt answer that came from her direction.\"The wash, dear,\" said Zoie to Alfred; \"Jimmy had to go after the wash,\"\nand then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to\nstop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, \"You needn't wait, Maggie; we\nunderstand.\"\"Sure, an' it's more 'an I do,\" answered Maggie, and shaking her head\nsadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of\nMaggie's inhuman parent.\"Just fancy,\" he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, \"fancy\nany man not liking to be the father of twins,\" and with that he again\nbent over the cradle and surveyed its contents.\"Think, Jimmy,\" he said,\nwhen he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, \"just think\nof the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.\"\"And then think of the way _I_ feel,\" grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; \"what have you to feel about?\"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a\ncrash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; \"nonsense!Here,\" he said, turning to Jimmy, \"you hold the boys and I'll go\nsee----\" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust\nupon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his\narms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,\nstrained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had\nstrode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked\nat Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining\nroom.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy\nbegan to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could\nscarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the\nbedroom door.\"She's come up the fire-escape,\" cried Aggie; \"she's beating Alfred to\ndeath.\"shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets.\"She's locking him in the bathroom,\" declared Aggie, and with that she\ndisappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of\nAggie.\"Wait a minute,\" called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find\na satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and\nhumanity.\"Eat 'em,\" was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her\nnegligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX\n\nNow, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this\ncommotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which\nhad been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly\nunprepared for the flying advent of Maggie.\"Oh, plaze, sir,\" she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward\nthe babes in Jimmy's arms, \"me fadder's coming right behind me.He's\na-lookin' for you sir.\"\"For me,\" murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth\nseemed to be looking for HIM.\"Put 'em down, sir,\" cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,\n\"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to\nturn.\"There,\" said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very\neyes.\"Of course,\" said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to\nlet the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that\ndisconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the\ncradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He\nlooked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made\na determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head\nthrough the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between\nO'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided\nto take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he\nstreaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that\nhe met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of\nthe Irish father.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,\nwavering as to which side to surrender himself.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself\non the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the\nrailing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's\nadvice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted\ninto the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,\ntrembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room.\"Lave go of me,\" cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a\nvain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for\nthe bed.\"Ah,\" he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object\nbeneath the covers, \"there you are, mum,\" and he shook his fist above\nwhat he believed to be the cowardly Mrs.\"'Tis well ye may cover\nup your head,\" said he, \"for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,\nbut when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'\n'em too.Then getting no response from the\nagitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in\nastonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but\nthree \"barren.\"\"They're child stalers, that's what they are,\" he declared to Maggie,\nas he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast.\"Me\nlittle Biddy,\" he crooned over his much coveted possession.\"Me little\nNorah,\" he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his\nnarrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled\nhis wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now\nsemi-quiet comforter.\"The black heart of ye, mum,\" he roared, then ordering Maggie to give\nback \"every penny of that shameless creetur's money\" he turned toward\nthe door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in\nhis denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman\nrushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,\nshe laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced\nher.she asked, then peering into\nthe face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed\nmoan.She scanned the face of the second\ninfant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother\nof the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the\ncradle.\"I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there,\" he said.Then\nbidding Maggie to \"git along out o' this\" and shrugging his shoulders\nto convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept\nquickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,\nthe Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when\nZoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother.\"How dare\nyou lock my husband in the bathroom?\"She pointed to the key, which the\nwoman still unconsciously clasped in her hand.\"Give me that key,\" she\ndemanded, \"give it to me this instant.\"\"Take your horrid old key,\" said the mother, and she threw it on the\nfloor.\"If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in\nJAIL,\"", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had\njust returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go\nto the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the\nbathroom door and demanding his instant release.\"I'll let him out,\" said Aggie.\"You get into bed,\" and she slipped\nquickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet\nand slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something\nrough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing\nagainst which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited\nbed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room\nemitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that\ndirection seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped\nin the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague\nfeeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all\nknowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion\nwas thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,\nand swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the\nupper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,\nawaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal\nhad transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and\nhe had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the\ntime he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a\nbabel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his\nshell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie\nbefore her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that\nthe pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,\nAggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend.\"You imagined it, Zoie,\" she declared, \"look for yourself.\"Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway.\"Well, perhaps I did,\" she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the\nroom, \"my nerves are jumping like fizzy water.\"They were soon to \"jump\" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with\nanger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered\nthe room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who\nhad dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly\nabout the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly\nacquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib.\"All,\" insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy\nrecollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,\nbut what had become of the other two?\"I don't know,\" said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that\nnight, \"I left them with Jimmy.\"shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, \"then he's at it again.And\nwith that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on\nhis face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and\npatted her shoulder condescendingly.\"Control yourself, my dear,\" he said.\"Control yourself; I'll get\nyour babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then,\" he added with\nparting emphasis from the doorway, \"I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!\"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie\nwere engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By\nuncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action\nfor him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for\nthe details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was\nwell covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the\nbedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly\nbeheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws\nwriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful\ncreature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting\ninto Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX\n\nHaving dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie\nwas bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred\nreturned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were\nthree infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical\nItalian woman, and last of all, Maggie.\"Bring them all in here, officer,\" called Alfred over his shoulder.\"I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are.\"Then turning to Aggie,\nwho stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,\n\"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.\"\"She's fainted,\" said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young\nwife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie\nand began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within\nhim, \"You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over\nZoie.\"Rouse yourself, my dear,\" he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up\nindignation.\"I'll let you know when I want to hear from you,\" snarled the officer to\nO'Flarety.\"But they're NOT her babies,\" protested the Italian woman desperately.\"Cut it,\" shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged\nparents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she\nregained her senses.\"Your babies are all right,\" he assured her.\"I've\nbrought them all back to you.\"gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been\nintervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking.\"Yes, dear,\" said Alfred, \"every one,\" and he pointed toward the three\ninfants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.\"I told you she'd be afraid to face us,\" shouted the now triumphant\nO'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, \"how dare you\npersecute this poor demented mother?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful\nItalian woman.\"She didn't persecute me, oh no!\"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and\nbegged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers.\"Let's hear her SAY it,\" demanded O'Flarety.\"You SHALL hear her,\" answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned\nto the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak.\"Sure,\" said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of\nZoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite\nher own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, \"take them\naway!\"This hateful reminder brought\nAlfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife.\"The excitement has unnerved her,\" he said to the officer.\"Ain't you about done with my kids?\"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any\nman with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a\n\"good payin' job.\"But Alfred's\nfaith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily\nshaken.\"My wife is in no condition to be questioned,\" he declared.\"She's out\nof her head, and if you don't----\"\n\nHe stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a\nsecond officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant\nJimmy.\"I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,\"\nhe called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a\nferocious expression.\"I caught him slipping down the fire-escape,\" explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach.\"Jimmy,\" said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes\nupon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast\nfailing faculties, \"you know the truth of this thing.You are the one\nwho sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a\nfather.\"asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected\nspouse.\"Of course I am,\" replied Alfred, with every confidence, \"but I have to\nprove it to the officer.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.Then turning to\nthe uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, \"Tell the\nofficer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am\nI not?\"\"If you're depending on ME for your future offspring,\" answered Jimmy,\nwagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, \"you\nare NOT a father.\"gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in\nbewilderment.\"Ask them,\" answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Creed of\nthe 15th of July last, that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain\n(which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver,\nand is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or two, which do give me mighty\ngreat comfort.To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W.\nPen carried me to Paul's, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with\nmy Lady, and there told her, of my Lord's sickness (of which though it\nhath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and\nrecovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter.I\nfound my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past.Thence\nto the Opera, which begins again to-day with \"The Witts,\" never acted yet\nwith scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who dined\nto-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state); and\nindeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.So home and was\novertaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this afternoon with my\nLady Batten, &c., at the Theatre.So I followed him to the Dolphin, where\nSir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made\nshift to fuddle Mr.At the office all the morning, though little to be done; because\nall our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, one of the\nController's clerks, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as\nany in the Office.But it is such a sickly time both in City and country\nevery where (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless\nit was in a plague-time.Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr.Nichols, Dean\nof Paul's; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.Dined at\nhome with the children and were merry, and my father with me; who after\ndinner he and I went forth about business.John Williams at an alehouse, where we staid till past nine at\nnight, in Shoe Lane, talking about our country business, and I found him\nso well acquainted with the matters of Gravely that I expect he will be of\ngreat use to me.I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon\nthe point of death.At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning.Then met with\nNed Pickering, and walked with him into St.James's Park (where I had not\nbeen a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and to speak loud\nof the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry to hear, and\nwhich I am afeard will bring all to ruin again.So he and I to the\nWardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera,\nand saw \"The Witts\" again, which I like exceedingly.The Queen of Bohemia\nwas here, brought by my Lord Craven.So the Captain and I and another to\nthe Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home.Troubled in mind that I\ncannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of\nplays.We have been at a great loss a great while for a vessel that I\nsent about a month ago with, things of my Lord's to Lynn, and cannot till\nnow hear of them, but now we are told that they are put into Soale Bay,\nbut to what purpose I know not.To our own church in the morning and so home to\ndinner, where my father and Dr.Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were\nvery merry.Sidney to my Lady to see\nmy Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and walks\nabout his chamber.So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my Lord\nGeneral Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce and sat with\nher; and then to walk in St.James's Park, and saw great variety of fowl\nwhich I never saw before and so home.At night fell to read in \"Hooker's\nEcclesiastical Polity,\" which Mr.Moore did give me last Wednesday very\nhandsomely bound; and which I shall read with great pains and love for his\nsake.At the office all the morning; at noon the children are sent for by\ntheir mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them\nby coach, and she to my father's and dines there, and from thence with\nthem to see Mrs.Cordery, who do invite them before my father goes into\nthe country, and thither I should have gone too but that I am sent for to\nthe Privy Seal, and there I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor's\n\n     [This \"thing\" was probably one of those large grants which Clarendon\n     quietly, or, as he himself says, \"without noise or scandal,\"\n     procured from the king.Besides lands and manors, Clarendon states\n     at one time that the king gave him a \"little billet into his hand,\n     that contained a warrant of his own hand-writing to Sir Stephen Fox\n     to pay to the Chancellor the sum of L20,000,--[approximately 10\n     million dollars in the year 2000]--of which nobody could have\n     notice.\"In 1662 he received L5,000 out of the money voted to the\n     king by the Parliament of Ireland, as he mentions in his vindication\n     of himself against the impeachment of the Commons; and we shall see\n     that Pepys, in February, 1664, names another sum of L20,000 given to\n     the Chancellor to clear the mortgage upon Clarendon Park; and this\n     last sum, it was believed, was paid from the money received from\n     France by the sale of Dunkirk.--B.]to be sealed this afternoon, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House,\nwhere severall Lords are met in Council this afternoon.And while I am\nwaiting there, in comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet\ncap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.Here I staid till at last, hearing that my Lord Privy Seal had not the\nseal here, Mr.Moore and I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at\nan alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came\nto his house, and so we to him and examined and sealed the thing, and so\nhomewards, but when we", "question": "Where is John?

Ford\nfor his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a\nmorning draft he and I went to Dr.Williams, but he not within we went to\nMrs.Whately's, who lately offered a proposal of\nher sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we discoursed about\nand agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her, and in\nthe meantime went to Will.Joyce's and to an alehouse, and drank a good\nwhile together, he being very angry that his father Fenner will give him\nand his brother no more for mourning than their father did give him and my\naunt at their mother's death, and a very troublesome fellow I still find\nhim to be, that his company ever wearys me.From thence about two o'clock\nto Mrs.Whately's, but she being going to dinner we went to Whitehall and\nthere staid till past three, and here I understand by Mr.Moore that my\nLady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very\nwell.Whately's again, and there were well received, and she\ndesirous to have the thing go forward, only is afeard that her daughter is\ntoo young and portion not big enough, but offers L200 down with her.The\ngirl is very well favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think\nwill do very well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield\nfrom her husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and\nso am I. Hence home to my father's, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped\nwith the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so\nhome.To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my\nwife by coach to my uncle Fenner's, where there was both at his house and\nthe Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I\nwonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were\nfain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.Then\nback again and to church, my father's family being all in mourning, doing\nhim the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us it: so to\nchurch, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight, my wife,\nand Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a\nWestphalia ham, and so home and to bed.This morning I went to my father's, and there found him and my\nmother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become\nvery simple and unquiet.Williams, and found him\nwithin, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom\nTrice's to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him\nfair we examined my uncle's will before him and Dr.Williams, and had them\nsign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so he took\nmy father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we were\nsworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.Williams and I to a cook's where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I to W.\nJoyce's, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the Opera,\nand shewed her \"The Witts,\" which I had seen already twice, and was most\nhighly pleased with it.So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see my Lady,\nand then home.At the office all the morning and did business; by and by we are\ncalled to Sir W. Batten's to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes\nhath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboon, but so much like a\nman in most things, that though they say there is a species of them, yet I\ncannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.I do\nbelieve that it already understands much English, and I am of the mind it\nmight be taught to speak or make signs.Hence the Comptroller and I to\nSir Rd.Ford's and viewed the house again, and are come to a complete end\nwith him to give him L200 per an.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the

sack, and so adieu, and then\nstraight to the Opera, and there saw \"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,\" done\nwith scenes very well, but above all, Betterton\n\n     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character\n     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that\n     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the\n     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with\nMr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there\nstaid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and\nso to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with\nmy wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very\ngood and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of\nrestitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look\nsomething askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and\nis not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at\nall.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country\nto-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to\nus, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep\nher no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to\nyield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay\nthere awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my\nfather and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave\nof them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and\nI home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do\ntrouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who\nhas this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the\ncountry to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear\nweeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by\nPall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all\nthings, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave\nher 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her\ngoing.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting\nthings even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I\nfind that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but\nL45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a\ncondition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle\nRobert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to\nmy mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my\nLady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the \"Antipodes,\"\nwherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil\ntavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my\nfather was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and\nsat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for\na wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he\nwill do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met\nwith a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at\nmy father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all\nwill be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and\nhis son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof\nto anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at\nhome I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of\nhis feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was\ntwice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out\nof doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane\ntavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to\nPortugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw\ntill he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord\nHinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in\ntheir way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's\nbedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of\nthe L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will\nnot do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to\nenquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and\nthen my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to\ndinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but\nmethinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a\npoor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw\n\"The Joviall Crew,\" where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,\nwere; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the\nwhile.Hence to my father's, and there staid to\ntalk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my\nwife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and\nwould have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but\nam afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands\nof him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife\nall the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to

Strindberg a Swedenborgian mystic.Of the early playwrights\nof the French Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre, Courteline and Ancey, practised the\nCom\u00e9die rosse, or brutal comedy, until Paris, tired of the uncouth\nnovelty, turned to the more amiable and no less natural work of Capus\nand Donnay.Brieux devoted himself to the composition of dramatic\ntracts.Bernard Shaw, after protesting that he \"could none other\" than\ndramatize slum landlords and rent collectors in \"Widowers' Houses,\"\nfound readier targets for his wit in bishops, professors of Greek and\nmillionaires.Nature, in fact, proved too strong for naturalism.No\nformula could embrace all the individual playwrights of that stormy\ntime.The most catholic of \"schools\" could not hold them.Formulas, however, die hard; and it is still necessary to free\nHeijermans from the \"naturalistic\" label so conveniently attached in\n1890 to works like Tolstoy's \"Power of Darkness,\" Hauptmann's Vor\nSonnenaufgang and Zola's \"Ther\u00e8se Raquin.\"All that his plays have\nin common with theirs is a faithful observation of life, and more\nparticularly of life among the common people.Moreover, he belongs\nto a newer generation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.He had written several short pieces (notably\nAhasuerus and 'n Jodenstreek?)in 1893 and 1894, but \"The Ghetto\"\n(1899) was his first important play.This three-act tragedy of the\nJewish quarter in a Dutch city has been published in an English\nadaptation which woefully misrepresents the original, and I should\nrather refer readers to a German translation (Berlin, Fleische)\nrevised by Heijermans himself.Like most early work, the play did\nnot satisfy its author, and several versions exist.Rafael, the son of an old Jewish merchant,\nhas an intrigue with the Gentile maidservant, Rose.His father,\nSachel, lives in an atmosphere of mistrust, hard dealing, thievery;\na patriarch with all the immemorial wrongs of the ghetto upon his\nshoulders, and all the racial instinct to preserve property, family\nand religion from contact with \"strange people.\"He is blind, but\nin the night he has heard the lovers' footsteps in the house.Rose\nhas lied to him; Rafael, as usual, is neglecting his business for\nGentile companions.After some bargaining over\nthe dowry, a marriage is arranged for Rafael with the daughter of\nanother merchant.The authority of the Rabbi is called in, but Rafael\nrefuses.He is a freethinker; in the ghetto, but not of it.\"Oh,\nthese little rooms of yours,--these hot, stifling chambers of despair,\nwhere no gust of wind penetrates, where the green of the leaves grows\nyellow, where the breath chokes and the soul withers!No, let me speak,\nRabbi Haeser!Now I am the priest; I, who am no Jew and no Christian,\nwho feel God in the sunlight, in the summer fragrance, in the gleam of\nthe water and the flowers upon my mother's grave... I have pity for\nyou, for your mean existence, for your ghettos and your little false\ngods--for the true God is yet to come, the God of the new community;\nthe commonwealth without gods, without baseness, without slaves!\"Sachel is blamed for allowing this open rupture to come about.It\nis better to pay the girl off quietly and have done with her,\nargue the other Jews.Every woman has her price--and especially\nevery Gentile woman.A hundred gulden--perhaps two hundred if she\nis obstinate--will settle the matter.The money is offered, but Rose\nis not to be bought.She has promised to go away with Rafael as his\nwife.He has gone out, but he will return for her.The family tell\nher that the money is offered with his consent; that he is tired of\nher and has left home for good.She has learned\nto mistrust the word of the Jews; she will only believe their sacred\noath.At last old Sachel swears by the roll of the commandments that\nhis son will not return.In despair, Rose throws herself into the\ncanal and is drowned.Rafael comes too late to save her.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.The God of\nthe Jews has taken his revenge.The play is perhaps a little na\u00efve and crudely imagined, but it\nhas all the essential characteristics of Heijermans' later work;\nthe intense humanitarian feeling, the burning rhetoric, the frankly\npartisan denunciation of society.In\ndealing with such a case of bigotry and racial intolerance, it is\nidle for a playwright to hold the scales with abstract justice.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.At\nmost he can only humanise the tragedy by humanising the villains of\nhis piece, and showing them driven into cruelty by traditional forces\nbeyond their control.That is the part of the \"Ankl\u00e4ger,\" the social\nprophet and Public Prosecutor; and it is the part which Heijermans,\nabove all others, has filled in the newer dramatic movement.In Het Pantser (\"The Coat of Mail\") his subject is the life of a Dutch\ngarrison town.\"The Coat of Mail\" is militarism; the creed of the\ngoverning caste.And the setting is peculiarly apt for the presentation\nof a social issue.In a small country such as Holland military\npatriotism may be strong, but it is tempered by the knowledge that the\ncountry only exists by the tolerance, or the diplomatic agreement, of\nmore powerful neighbours, and that in case of war it could do no more\nthan sacrifice an army to the invader.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.To the philosophic workman,\nthen, well read in revolutionary literature from Marx to Kropotkin,\nthe standing army presents itself simply as a capitalist tool, a\nbulwark of the employing class against trade unionism.The industrial\nstruggle is uncomplicated by sentimentality.Patriotic stampedes to the\nconservative side are unknown.Strikes are\nfrequent, and the protection of \"blackleg\" labourers is in the hands\nof the garrison.That is the theme of this \"romantic military play.\"Mari, a second lieutenant, refuses to serve on strike duty.He is a\nweak but sincere idealist; his head full of humanitarian enthusiasm,\nhis rooms stocked with anti-militarist pamphlets.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.He will leave the\narmy rather than order his men to fire on the factory workers.Around\nhim stand the members of the military caste, linked together by\ntradition and family relationship.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.His father is a colonel in the same\nregiment; the father of his fianc\u00e9e, Martha, is commanding officer.One\nfriend he has: an army doctor named Berens, who has infected himself\nwith cancer serum in attempting to discover a cure for the disease,\nand passes for a drunkard because he keeps the symptoms in check by\nalcohol.Here a parallel is drawn between military bravery and the\ncivilian courage of the scientist.Mari is put under arrest, but the affair is kept secret in order to\navoid a scandal.He can only be reinstated by full withdrawal and\napology.Martha comes to him and implores him to withdraw.He can plead the excitement of the moment\nin excuse, and the matter will be settled honorably.A friendly discussion of the point with his superior\nofficers is interrupted by a volley in the street outside.The troops\nhave fired upon the mob, and the son of the shoemaker over the way\nhas been shot.Mari sends in his papers; but a newspaper has published the facts of\nthe case, and he is met with the disgrace of immediate dismissal from\nthe army.She must marry a soldier; civilian\nlife with a dismissed lieutenant was not in the bond.So Mari suffers\nanother disillusionment, and the end of the play sees him setting\nout from home, while the old shoemaker is left to lament for his son.A warm heart, a weakness for rhetoric,\nand--a study in vacillation.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.In Ora et Labora Heijermans is less rhetorical; rather, one suspects,\nfor lack of a mouthpiece.His peasants bear their fate, if not in\nsilence, with almost inarticulate resignation.They are too hungry to\nwaste words.Moreover, there is no visible enemy to denounce, no Coat\nof Mail, no racial prejudice, no insatiate capitalism.Winter is the\nvillain of the piece.This is indeed naturalism, in the literal sense;\nhumanity devoured by Nature.Everything is frost-bound: the canal,\nthe soil, the very cattle.When the last cow upon the farm dies of disease, its throat\nis cut so that it can be sold to the butcher.All hopes are centred\nin the father of the family, who is to sell the carcase in the town;\nbut he spends the money and returns home drunk.As a last resort,\nhis son Eelke enlists in the army for six years' colonial service,\nleaving Sytske, the girl he was about to marry.His advance pay buys\nfuel and food, but the lovers part with a hopeless quarrel, and the\nold peasants are left wrangling over the money he has brought.Allerzielen (1906) is a later work.A village pastor finds a woman\nin a state of collapse upon his threshold.He takes her in, and she\ngives birth to a child.She is a stranger in the district, Rita by\nname.The child is sent into the village to be nursed, while the\npastor gives up his own room to the mother.She recovers slowly, and\nmeanwhile the peasants set their tongues to work upon the scandal.The\nchild is discovered to be illegitimate.A good village housewife is\nsuckling a bastard.The pastor is housing an outcast, and shows no\nsign of sending her about her business.Dimly and distantly the Bishop is said to be considering\nthe facts.... Amid alarums and excursions the affair pursues its\ncourse.The village passes from astonishment to ribaldry, from ribaldry\nto stone-throwing.The pastor speaks gently of Christian charity and\nsouls to be saved, but fails to appease his parishioners.They are\nhot upon the scent in a heresy-hunt.If they could see within the\nparsonage walls, they would yelp still louder.For Rita proves to be\nan unblushing hedonist.No prayers for her, when the birth-pangs are\nonce over; no tears, no repentance.She sings gaily in her room while\nthe pastors argue about duty and morals.She\ninvades the study to enjoy a view of sunlight, clouds and sea.She\nfinds the waves more musical than the wheezing of the church organ.If\nonly the child were with her, her happiness would be complete.But the child is neglected by its foster mother.The pastor is driven from his church by the Bishop, and leaves\nthe broken windows of the parsonage to his successor.Rita and he\nare both homeless now.And then the child's father comes,--another\nhedonist.Its body lies in\nunconsecrated ground, but the vows of love are renewed at the\ngraveside.All roads are\nopen to the spirits of the free.The pastor can only offer a hopeless\n\"Farewell\" as the two set out upon their way.But Rita calls after,\n\"No,--no!It matters nothing that this gospel of Life has often been\npreached.Heijermans has caught the spirit of it as well as the\nletter.His characters say and do nothing particularly original;\nnothing that would even pass for originality by reason of its\nmanner.He works in vivid contrasts, without a shade of paradox.He\nfigures the opposed forces of Reaction and Revolution in religion,\nin statecraft, in economics, in all human relationships, with a\nsimplicity of mind which would draw a smile from the forever up-to-date\n\"intellectual.\"Reaction is a devilish superstition; Revolution\na prophetic", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "The one\nis false, the other true.There is no disputing the point, since\ntruth and falsehood are absolute terms.Perhaps the secret is that\nHeijermans never tires of his own philosophy.He is content to see it\nfirmly planted on the ground; he does not demand that it should walk\nthe tight-rope or turn somersaults as an intellectual exercise.He\nhas accepted a view of life which some call materialistic, and others\npositivist, or scientific, or humanitarian; but for him it is simply\nhumane,--founded upon social justice and human need.A philosophy, however, does not make a dramatist.In the plays I\nhave already described Heijermans shows his power of translating\nthe world-struggle of thought into the dramatic clash of will, but\nit is upon \"The Good Hope\" (Op Hoop van Zegen) that his reputation\nchiefly depends.He chooses a great subject; not merely the conflict\nof shipowners and fishermen in the struggle for existence, but the\nsea-faring life and the ocean itself.Truly \"a sea-piece\"; tempestuous,\npowerful.From the opening\nscene, with the old men's tale of sharks, to the night of the storm\nin the third act, when the women and children huddle in Kneirtje's\ncottage for shelter, the story is always the same.It takes a father here, a brother there.It seizes\nGeert and Barend alike; the one going aboard carelessly, the other\nscreaming resistance.Sometimes it plays with its victims on shore,\nmaking no sign, leaving months of hope to end in despair.In a more\nmerciful mood it sends children running through the village to cry\n\"'n Ball op!as an overdue ship is signalled from the\ncoastguard tower.And there an echo of the sea-ballad now and again;\nwhen raps are heard upon the door at the height of the storm, or\na flapping curtain blows out the lamp, or a pallid face is seen at\nthe window....\n\nIn sheer force of theatrical construction \"The Good Hope\" is still\nmore striking.The play is\nfull of natural rather than violent coincidence.Barend has always\nfeared death by drowning, and he makes his first and last voyage in\na leaky trawler.His father sank in a wreck, and it is his mother,\nunable to maintain the household, who persuades him to go.She fears\nthe disgrace of his refusal after the papers are signed, but he is\ndragged aboard by the harbour police.His brother Geert sets out\nproudly enough, singing the Marseillaise and preaching rebellion;\nbut he sinks far away, impotent, unheard, and leaves his sweetheart\nto bear a fatherless child.Old Cobus can only reflect, \"We take\nthe fishes, and God takes us.\"That is perhaps the most dramatic\nthread of all,--the parallel of fate.The struggle for existence on\nland drives men to the fishing-boats and the Dogger Bank.From the\nminnows to leviathan, there is no escape.\"We take the fishes, and\nGod takes us.\"A gale of wind and rain whistles through the play,\nsweeping the decks of life, tossing men out into the unknown.The ship-owner, Bos, is frankly\na villain.He knows \"The Good Hope\" is unseaworthy, but he allows her\nto sail.True, the warning comes from a drunken ship's carpenter,\nbut he understands the risks.The ship is\nwell insured....\n\nIt is implied, then, that shipowners are unscrupulous scoundrels,\nand fishermen their unhappy victims.Here is a bias which makes\nthe actual tragedy no more impressive.Good ships, as well as bad,\nmay perish in a storm.Nature is cruel enough without the help of\nman.The problem of the big fish and the little fish is one of size,\nnot of morality.Even sharks may possibly rejoice in an amiable\ntemperament.It can only be said that Heijermans has here chosen the\nright motive for his own particular type of drama.He knows that, humanly speaking, in every conflict\nbetween employers and employed, the men are right and the masters\nwrong.Impossible to redress the balance by individual virtue or\nkindliness.The masters stand for the exploiting system; for capital,\nfor insurance, for power, for law and order and possession.Their\nrisks are less and their temptations greater.Even from the standpoint\nof abstract justice, a dishonest employer may fairly be set against\na drunken labourer or a gaol-bird fisherman.The one is no less\nnatural than the other.But Heijermans goes beyond all finicking\nconsiderations of this sort.He seeks to destroy and rebuild, not\nto repair or adjust.He avoids mere naturalism; the \"conscientious\ntranscription of all the visible and repetition of all the audible\"\nis not for him.And here he is undoubtedly justified, not only by\nhis own experience, but by that of other dramatists.There was no\ninspiration in the movement towards mere actuality on the stage.It\nsickened of its own surfeit of \"life.\"Its accumulated squalor became\nintolerable.It was choked by its own irrelevance, circumscribed\nby its own narrowness.For naturalism is like a prison courtyard;\nit offers only two ways of escape.One is the poet's upward flight,\nthe other the revolutionist's battering-ram.Heijermans has chosen\nhis own weapon, and used it well.He has given us \"The Good Hope,\"\nnot as a mere pitiful study in disillusionment, but as a tragic symbol\nof human effort in the conquest of despair.Kneirtje, a fisherman's widow.Geert   }\n    Barend  }  her sons.Daantje, from the Old Men's Home.Mees, Marietje's betrothed.Truus, a fisherman's wife.The Drama is laid in a North Sea fishing village.Copyright 1912 by The Dramatic Publishing Company.THE GOOD HOPE\n\n                    A Drama of the Sea in Four Acts.[Kneirtje's home, a poor living-room.At the left, two wall bedsteads\nand a door;

and the\nRoumanians are thought to have shown an enviable wisdom in giving them\nas little chance as possible.But then, the reflection occurring that\nsome of the most objectionable Jews are baptised Christians, it is\nobvious that such clauses would have been insufficient, and the doctrine\nthat you can turn a Jew into a good Christian is emphatically retracted.But clearly, these liberal gentlemen, too late enlightened by\ndisagreeable events, must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who\nargued against them long ago; and it is a striking spectacle to witness\nminds so panting for advancement in some directions that they are ready\nto force it on an unwilling society, in this instance despairingly\nrecurring to mediaeval types of thinking--insisting that the Jews are\nmade viciously cosmopolitan by holding the world's money-bag, that for\nthem all national interests are resolved into the algebra of loans, that\nthey have suffered an inward degradation stamping them as morally\ninferior, and--\"serve them right,\" since they rejected Christianity.All\nwhich is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a\nservile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been\nrepeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose\nplace in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the\nclause, \"No Irish need apply,\" parallels the sentence which for many\npolite persons sums up the question of Judaism--\"I never _did_ like the\nJews.\"It is certainly worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised\nrace, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not\ninevitably lack some conditions of nobleness.If they drop that\nseparateness which is made their reproach, they may be in danger of\nlapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of\nmissing that inward identification with the nationality immediately\naround them which might make some amends for their inherited privation.No dispassionate observer can deny this danger.Why, our own countrymen\nwho take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their\nsense of fellowship in the affairs of their own land are rarely good\nspecimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a\nnative country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind,\nexisting like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of\nbeing included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations\nand the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging\nwhich is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these\nspiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst\nconsequences of their voluntary dispersion.Unquestionably the Jews,\nhaving been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral\ninfluences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have\nsuffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have\nescaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the\nnations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened in\nthe case of a people who had neither their adhesion to a separate\nreligion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family\naffectionateness.Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the _corpus vile_ on\nwhich rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name\nflung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt,\nthey have remained proud of their origin.Does any one call this an evil\npride?Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a\ndemocratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his\nfather was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan,\nor who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman.It\nis possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that\narrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence.The pride which\nidentifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating\nhabit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or\nother selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man\nswayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject.That a Jew of\nSmyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too\nofficious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, \"I am a\nJew,\" is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of\nunderstanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history.And\nagain, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different\ncountries tends to the impression that they have a predominant\nkindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of\ntheir race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression.The concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the\ncapacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the\ncare for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their\nreligion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by\nexclusiveness.And the kindliness of the Jew overflows the line of\ndivision between him and the Gentile.On the whole, one of the most\nremarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for\nages \"a scorn and a hissing\" is, that after being subjected to this\nprocess, which might have been expected to be in every sense\ndeteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate\nwhich allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all\nEuropean countries in healthiness and beauty of _physique_, in practical\nability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of\nethical value.A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in\nthe fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany\nis a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the\nhead of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew.And here it is\nthat we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now\nstimulating the revived expression of old antipathies.\"The Jews,\" it is\nfelt, \"have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in\ncommerce but in political life.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.Their monetary hold on governments is\ntending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism\n(euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given\nthem a full share in civil and political rights.A people with oriental\nsunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised,\nthey have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best\nprizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament\nat their disposal.\"There is truth in these views of Jewish social and political relations.But it is rather too late for liberal pleaders to urge them in a merely\nvituperative sense.Do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger\nof our healthier national influences getting overridden by Jewish\npredominance, that we should repeal our emancipatory laws?<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.Not all the\nGermanic immigrants who have been settling among us for generations,\nand are still pouring in to settle, are Jews, but thoroughly Teutonic\nand more or less Christian craftsmen, mechanicians, or skilled and\nerudite functionaries; and the Semitic Christians who swarm among us are\ndangerously like their unconverted brethren in complexion, persistence,\nand wealth.Then there are the Greeks who, by the help of Phoenician\nblood or otherwise, are objectionably strong in the city.Some judges\nthink that the Scotch are more numerous and prosperous here in the South\nthan is quite for the good of us Southerners; and the early\ninconvenience felt under the Stuarts of being quartered upon by a\nhungry, hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of\nreligion, and higher cheek-bones than English taste requires, has not\nyet been quite neutralised.As for the Irish, it is felt in high\nquarters that we have always been too lenient towards them;--at least,\nif they had been harried a little more there might not have been so many\nof them on the English press, of which they divide the power with the\nScotch, thus driving many Englishmen to honest and ineloquent labour.So far shall we be carried if we go in search of devices to hinder\npeople of other blood than our own from getting the advantage of\ndwelling among us.Let it be admitted that it is a calamity to the English, as to any other\ngreat historic people, to undergo a premature fusion with immigrants of\nalien blood; that its distinctive national characteristics should be in\ndanger of obliteration by the predominating quality of foreign settlers.I not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the\nthreatened danger.To one who loves his native language, who would\ndelight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign\naccent, foreign intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal\nmeaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an\naffliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our\nstudios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices,\nwarehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English\nwith its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of\nacquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument,\ndelivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred\nbeyond recognition; that there should be a general ambition to speak\nevery language except our mother English, which persons \"of style\" are\nnot ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a\npronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them\nbetween jostling consonants.An ancient Greek might not like to be\nresuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities,\nstill he would at least find more instructive marvels in other\ndevelopments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern\nEnglishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere\ndelivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some\nnovelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on\nprepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom.it is\nour inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our\nwilling ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage,\nwhile we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile\nimitation of what is native.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.This marring of our speech, however, is a minor evil compared with what\nmust follow from the predominance of wealth--acquiring immigrants, whose\nappreciation of our political and social life must often be as\napproximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language.But take the worst issues--what can we do to hinder them?Are we to\nadopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese?Are we\nto tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the\nworld-wide blessing of the oppressed?It is not agreeable to find\nforeign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant\nexception to the general rule of discourse.But to urge on that account\nthat we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of\ninternational relations not in the long-run favourable to the interests\nof our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call\nobtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and\ncheaply idle living to be found.In meeting the national evils which are\nbrought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no\nmore immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller\nnational excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more\nexcellent individual natives.The tendency of things is towards the\nquicker or slower fusion of races.It is impossible to arrest this\ntendency: all we can do is to moderate its course so as to hinder it\nfrom degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement\nof those national traditions and customs which are the language of the\nnational genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment.Such moderating\nand guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort.And it is\nin this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities\nhas value.That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form\na state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government\nhas been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and\nin virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European\ncouncils.Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though\nfar-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination.We\nhave to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before\nwe can be sure of our ground.The only point in this connection on which Englishmen are agreed is,\nthat England itself shall not be subject to foreign rule.The fiery\nresolve to resist invasion, though with an improvised array of\npitchforks, is felt to be virtuous, and to be worthy of a historic\npeople.Because there is a national life in our veins.Because\nthere is something specifically English which we feel to be supremely\nworth striving for, worth dying for, rather than living to renounce it.Because we too have our share--perhaps a principal share--in", "question": "Where is Mary?

and if any\nreference is made to their past or future destinies some hearer is sure\nto state as a relevant fact which may assist our judgment, that she, for\nher part, is not fond of them, having known a Mr Jacobson who was very\nunpleasant, or that he, for his part, thinks meanly of them as a race,\nthough on inquiry you find that he is so little acquainted with their\ncharacteristics that he is astonished to learn how many persons whom he\nhas blindly admired and applauded are Jews to the backbone.Again, men\nwho consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing\nhistory and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their\ncontemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the\nJews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own\nagreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a\ntransformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying\n\"civilisation\" as a transformed tribal existence of which some\nlineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native\nAustralians.Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name\n\"Father\" should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their\nview of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of\nthings in which nobody knew his own father?For less theoretic men, ambitious, to be regarded as practical\npoliticians, the value of the Hebrew race has been measured by their\nunfavourable opinion of a prime minister who is a Jew by lineage.But it\nis possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of\nWalpole or of Chatham; and in any case I think Englishmen would refuse\nto accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesmen\nas the standard of value for the English people and the part they have\nto play in the fortunes of mankind.If we are to consider the future of the Jews at all, it seems\nreasonable to take as a preliminary question: Are they destined to\ncomplete fusion with the peoples among whom they are dispersed, losing\nevery remnant of a distinctive consciousness as Jews; or, are there in\nthe breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness, or\nwhat we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness,\nactually exists in the world-wide Jewish communities--the seven millions\nscattered from east to west--and again, are there in the political\nrelations of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the\nrestoration of a Jewish state planted on the old ground as a centre of\nnational feeling, a source of dignifying protection, a special channel\nfor special energies which may contribute some added form of national\ngenius, and an added voice in the councils of the world?They are among us everywhere: it is useless to say we are not fond of\nthem.Perhaps we are not fond of proletaries and their tendency to form\nUnions, but the world is not therefore to be rid of them.If we wish to\nfree ourselves from the inconveniences that we have to complain of,\nwhether in proletaries or in Jews, our best course is to encourage all\nmeans of improving these neighbours who elbow us in a thickening crowd,\nand of sending their incommodious energies into beneficent channels.Why\nare we so eager for the dignity of certain populations of whom perhaps\nwe have never seen a single specimen, and of whose history, legend, or\nliterature we have been contentedly ignorant for ages, while we sneer at\nthe notion of a renovated national dignity for the Jews, whose ways of\nthinking and whose very verbal forms are on our lips in every prayer\nwhich we end with an Amen?Some of us consider this question dismissed\nwhen they have said that the wealthiest Jews have no desire to forsake\ntheir European palaces, and go to live in Jerusalem.But in a return\nfrom exile, in the restoration of a people, the question is not whether\ncertain rich men will choose to remain behind, but whether there will be\nfound worthy men who will choose to lead the return.Plenty of\nprosperous Jews remained in Babylon when Ezra marshalled his band of\nforty thousand and began a new glorious epoch in the history of his\nrace, making the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world\nwhich has been held glorious enough to be dated from for evermore.The\nhinge of possibility is simply the existence of an adequate community of\nfeeling as well as widespread need in the Jewish race, and the hope that\namong its finer specimens there may arise some men of instruction and\nardent public spirit, some new Ezras, some modern Maccabees, who will\nknow how to use all favouring outward conditions, how to triumph by\nheroic example, over the indifference of their fellows and the scorn of\ntheir foes, and will steadfastly set their faces towards making their\npeople once more one among the nations.Formerly, evangelical orthodoxy was prone to dwell on the fulfilment of\nprophecy in the \"restoration of the Jews,\" Such interpretation of the\nprophets is less in vogue now.The dominant mode is to insist on a\nChristianity that disowns its origin, that is not a substantial growth\nhaving a genealogy, but is a vaporous reflex of modern notions.The\nChrist of Matthew had the heart of a Jew--\"Go ye first to the lost\nsheep of the house of Israel.\"The Apostle of the Gentiles had the heart\nof a Jew: \"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my\nbrethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom\npertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the\ngiving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are\nthe fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\"Modern\napostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they\nprefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase.But the\nmediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the\ndays of Augustus.Pagans in successive ages said, \"These people are\nunlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them.\"The Jews\nwere steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness\nChristianity was born.A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from\nthe freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may\nbe enriched.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy\nof a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down?There is still a\ngreat function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should\nshut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his\nnational history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance\nwhich that history has left him.Every Jew should be conscious that he\nis one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal\nachievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to\nthem a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in\nfaculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new\nbeneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the\ntraditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers.There is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought\nforth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the\nworld, is bound by their visions.Yes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy\nchild of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,\nfeels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and\nthe possible renovation of his national family.Will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his\ndoctrine a philosophy?He will teach a blinding superstition--the\nsuperstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in\ndisregard of the influences which have made us human._The portraits of Lodovic Sforza, Duke of Milan, and Maximilian his\neldest son, and on the other side Beatrix his dutchess, and Francesco\nhis other son_, all in one picture, in the same Refectory with the Last\nSupper[i166]._The portraits of two of the handsomest women at Florence_, painted by\nhim as a present to Lewis XII[i167]._The painting in the council-chamber at Florence_[i168].The subject of\nthis is the battle of Attila[i169]._A portrait of Ginevra_, daughter of Americo Benci[i170]._The portrait of Mona Lisa_, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo,\npainted for her husband[i171].Lomazzo has said, she was a Neapolitan,\nbut this is supposed a mistake, and that she was a Florentine[i172].In\na note of Mariette's, Lett.175, this picture is said\nto have been in the collection of Francis I.

notwithstanding which, it cannot\nperfectly comprehend more than one object at a time.For example, the\nreader, at one look over this page, immediately perceives it full of\ndifferent characters; but he cannot at the same moment distinguish each\nletter, much less can he comprehend their meaning.He must consider it\nword by word, and line by line, if he be desirous of forming a just\nnotion of these characters.In like manner, if we wish to ascend to\nthe top of an edifice, we must be content to advance step by step,\notherwise we shall never be able to attain it.A young man, who has a natural inclination to the study of this art,\nI would advise to act thus: In order to acquire a true notion of the\nform of things, he must begin by studying the parts which compose\nthem, and not pass to a second till he has well stored his memory, and\nsufficiently practised the first; otherwise he loses his time, and will\nmost certainly protract his studies.And let him remember to acquire\naccuracy before he attempts quickness.III./--_How to discover a young Man's Disposition for Painting._\n\n\n/Many/ are very desirous of learning to draw, and are very fond of it,\nwho are, notwithstanding, void of a proper disposition for it.This may\nbe known by their want of perseverance; like boys, who draw every thing\nin a hurry, never finishing, or shadowing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.IV./--_Of Painting, and its Divisions._\n\n\n/Painting/ is divided into two principal parts.The first is the figure,\nthat is, the lines which distinguish the forms of bodies, and their\ncomponent parts.The second is the colour contained within those limits.V./--_Division of the Figure._\n\n\n/The/ form of bodies is divided into two parts; that is, the proportion\nof the members to each other, which must correspond with the whole; and\nthe motion, expressive of what passes in the mind of the living figure.VI./--_Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/The/ proportion of members is again divided into two parts, viz.By equality is meant (besides the measure\ncorresponding with the whole), that you do not confound the members\nof a young subject with those of old age, nor plump ones with those\nthat are lean; and that, moreover, you do not blend the robust and firm\nmuscles of man with feminine softness: that the attitudes and motions\nof old age be not expressed with the quickness and alacrity of youth;\nnor those of a female figure like those of a vigorous young man.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.The\nmotions and members of a strong man should be such as to express his\nperfect state of health.VII./--_Of Dimensions in general._\n\n\n/In/ general, the dimensions of the human body are to be considered\nin the length, and not in the breadth; because in the wonderful works\nof Nature, which we endeavour to imitate, we cannot in any species\nfind any one part in one model precisely similar to the same part in\nanother.Let us be attentive, therefore, to the variation of forms,\nand avoid all monstrosities of proportion; such as long legs united\nto short bodies, and narrow chests with long arms.Observe also\nattentively the measure of joints, in which Nature is apt to vary\nconsiderably; and imitate her example by doing the same.VIII./--_Motion, Changes, and Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/The/ measures of the human body vary in each member, according as it\nis more or less bent, or seen in different views, increasing on one\nside as much as they diminish on the other.IX./--_The Difference of Proportion between Children and grown\nMen._\n\n\n/In/ men and children I find a great difference between the joints of\nthe one and the other in the length of the bones.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.A man has the length\nof two heads from the extremity of one shoulder to the other, the same\nfrom the shoulder to the elbow, and from the elbow to the fingers; but\nthe child has only one, because Nature gives the proper size first to\nthe seat of the intellect, and afterwards to the other parts.X./--_The Alterations in the Proportion of the human Body from\nInfancy to full Age._\n\n\n/A man/, in his infancy, has the breadth of his shoulders equal to the\nlength of the face, and to the length of the arm from the shoulder\nto the elbow, when the arm is bent[2].It is the same again from the\nlower belly to the knee, and from the knee to the foot.But, when a\nman is arrived at the period of his full growth, every one of these\ndimensions becomes double in length, except the face, which, with\nthe top of the head, undergoes but very little alteration in length.A well-proportioned and full-grown man, therefore, is ten times the\nlength of his face; the breadth of his shoulders will be two faces, and\nin like manner all the above lengths will be double.The rest will be\nexplained in the general measurement of the human body[3].<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.XI./--_Of the Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/All/ the parts of any animal whatever must be correspondent with\nthe whole.So that, if the body be short and thick, all the members\nbelonging to it must be the same.One that is long and thin must have\nits parts of the same kind; and so of the middle size.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Something of the\nsame may be observed in plants, when uninjured by men or tempests; for\nwhen thus injured they bud and grow again, making young shoots from old\nplants, and by those means destroying their natural symmetry.XII./--_That every Part be proportioned to its Whole._\n\n\n/If/ a man be short and thick, be careful that all his members be\nof the same nature, viz.short arms and thick, large hands, short\nfingers, with broad joints; and so of the rest.XIII./--_Of the Proportion of the Members._\n\n\n/Measure/ upon yourself the proportion of the parts, and, if you find\nany of them defective, note it down, and be very careful to avoid it in\ndrawing your own compositions.For this is reckoned a common fault in\npainters, to delight in the imitation of themselves.XIV./--_The Danger of forming an erroneous Judgment in regard to\nthe Proportion and Beauty of the Parts._\n\n\n/If/ the painter has clumsy hands, he will be apt to introduce them\ninto his works, and so of any other part of his person, which may not\nhappen to be so beautiful as it ought to be.He must, therefore, guard\nparticularly against that self-love, or too good opinion of his own\nperson, and study by every means to acquire the knowledge of what is\nmost beautiful, and of his own defects, that he may adopt the one and\navoid the other.XV./--_Another Precept._\n\n\n/The/ young painter must, in the first instance, accustom his hand to\ncopying the drawings of good masters; and when his hand is thus formed,\nand ready, he should, with the advice of his director, use himself also\nto draw from relievos; according to the rules we shall point out in the\ntreatise on drawing from relievos[4].XVI./--_The Manner of drawing from Relievos, and rendering Paper\nfit for it._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from relievos, tinge your paper of some darkish\ndemi-tint.And after you have made your outline, put in the darkest\nshadows, and, last of all, the principal lights, but sparingly,\nespecially the smaller ones; because those are easily lost to the eye\nat a very moderate distance[5].XVII./--_Of drawing from Casts or Nature._\n\n\n/In/ drawing from relievo, the draftsman must place himself in such a\nmanner, as that the eye of the figure to be drawn be level with his\nown[6].XVIII./--_To draw Figures from Nature._\n\n\n/Accustom/ yourself to hold a plummet in your hand, that you may judge\nof the bearing of the parts.XIX./--_Of drawing from Nature._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from Nature, you must be at the distance of three times\nthe height of the object; and when you begin to draw, form in your own\nmind a certain principal line (suppose a perpendicular); observe well\nthe bearing of the parts towards that line; whether they intersect, are\nparallel to it, or oblique.XX./--_Of drawing Academy Figures._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from a naked model, always sketch in the whole of the\nfigure, suiting all the members well to each other; and though you\nfinish only that part which appears the best, have a regard to the\nrest, that, whenever you make use of such studies, all the parts may\nhang together.In composing your attitudes, take care not to turn the head on the same\nside as the breast, nor let the arm go in a line with the leg[7].If\nthe head turn towards the right shoulder, the parts must be lower on\nthe left side than on the other; but if the chest come forward, and the\nhead turn towards the left, the parts on the right side are to be the\nhighest.XXI./--_Of studying in the Dark, on first waking in the Morning,\nand before going to sleep._\n\n\n/I have/ experienced no small benefit, when in the dark and in bed, by\nretracing in my mind the outlines of those forms which I had previously\nstudied, particularly such as had appeared the most difficult to\ncomprehend and retain; by this method they will be confirmed and\ntreasured up in the memory.XXII./--_Observations on drawing Portraits._\n\n\n/The/ cartilage, which raises the nose in the middle of the face,\nvaries in eight different ways.It is equally straight, equally\nconcave, or equally convex, which is the first sort.Or, secondly,\nunequally straight, concave, or convex.Or, thirdly, straight in the\nupper part, and concave in the under.Or, fourthly, straight again\nin the upper part, and convex in those below.Or, fifthly, it may be\nconcave and straight beneath.Or, sixthly, concave above, and convex\nbelow.Or, seventhly, it may be convex in the upper part, and straight\nin the lower.And in the eighth and last place, convex above, and\nconcave beneath.The uniting of the nose with the brows is in two ways, either it is\nstraight or concave.It is\nstraight, concave, or round.The first is divided into two parts, viz.it is either convex in the upper part, or in the lower, sometimes both;\nor else flat above and below.XXIII./--_The Method of retaining in the Memory the Likeness of\na Man, so as to draw his Profile, after having seen him only once._\n\n\n/You/ must observe and remember well the variations of the four\nprincipal features in the profile; the nose, mouth, chin, and forehead.And first of the nose, of which there are three different sorts[8],\nstraight, concave, and convex.Of the straight there are but four\nvariations, short or long, high at the end, or low.Of the concave\nthere are three sorts; some have the concavity above, some in the\nmiddle, and some at the end.The convex noses also vary three ways;\nsome project in the upper part, some in the middle, and others at the\nbottom.Nature, which seems to delight in infinite variety, gives again\nthree changes to those noses which have a projection in the middle; for\nsome have it straight, some concave, and some convex.XXIV./--_How to remember the Form of a Face._\n\n\n/If/ you wish to retain with facility the general look of a face, you\nmust first learn how to draw well several faces, mouths, eyes, noses,\nchins, throats, necks, and shoulders; in short, all those principal\nparts which distinguish one man from another.For instance, noses are\noften different sorts[9].<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.Straight, bunched, concave, some raised\nabove, some below the middle, aquiline, flat, round, and sharp.In the front view there are eleven different sorts.Even, thick in the middle, thin in the middle, thick at the tip, thin\nat the beginning, thin at the tip, and thick at the beginning.Broad,\nnarrow, high, and low nostrils; some with a large opening, and some\nmore shut towards the tip.The same variety will be found in the other parts of the face, which\nmust be drawn from Nature, and retained in the memory.Or else, when\nyou mean to draw a likeness from memory, take with you a pocket-book,\nin which you have marked all these variations of features, and after\nhaving given a look at the face you mean to draw, retire a little\naside, and note down in your book which of the features are similar to\nit; that you may put it all together at home.XXV./--_That a Painter should take Pleasure in the Opinion of\nevery body._\n\n\n/A painter/ ought not certainly to refuse listening to the opinion of\nany one; for we know that, although a man be not a painter, he may have\njust notions of the forms of men; whether a man has a hump on his back,\na thick leg, or a large hand; whether he be lame, or have any other\ndefect.Now, if we know that men are able to judge of the works of\nNature, should we not think them more able to detect our errors?XXVI./--_What is principally to be observed in Figures._\n\n\n/The/ principal and most important consideration required in drawing\nfigures, is to set the head well upon the shoulders, the chest upon the\nhips, the hips and shoulders upon the feet.XXVII./--_Mode of Studying._\n\n\n/Study/ the science first, and then follow the practice which results\nfrom that science.Pursue method in your study, and do not quit one\npart till it be perfectly engraven in the memory; and observe what\ndifference there is between the members of animals and their joints[10].XXVIII./--_Of being universal._\n\n\n/It/ is an easy matter for a man who is well versed in the principles\nof his art, to become universal in the practice of it, since all\nanimals have a similarity of members, that is, muscles, tendons, bones,\n&c. These only vary in length or thickness, as will be demonstrated\nin the Anatomy[11].<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.As for aquatic animals, of which there is great\nvariety, I shall not persuade the painter to take them as a rule,\nhaving no<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.", "question": "Where is Sandra?

Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.XXXI./--_Of the small Bones in several Joints of the human Body._\n\n\n/There/ are in the joints of the human body certain small bones, fixed\nin the middle of the tendons which connect several of the joints.Such\nare the patellas of the knees, and the joints of the shoulders, and\nthose of the feet.They are eight in number, one at each shoulder, one\nat each knee, and two at each foot under the first joint of the great\ntoe towards the heel.These grow extremely hard as a man advances in\nyears.XXXII./--_Memorandum to be observed by the Painter._\n\n\n/Note/ down which muscles and tendons are brought into action by the\nmotion of any member, and when they are hidden.Remember that these\nremarks are of the greatest importance to painters and sculptors, who\nprofess to study anatomy, and the science of the muscles.Do the same\nwith children, following the different gradations of age from their\nbirth even to decrepitude, describing the changes which the members,\nand particularly the joints, undergo; which of them grow fat, and which\nlean.XXXIII./--_The Shoulders._\n\n\n/The/ joints of the shoulders, and other parts which bend, shall be\nnoticed in their places in the Treatise on Anatomy, where the cause\nof the motions of all the parts which compose the human body shall be\nexplained[12].XXXIV./--_The Difference of Joints between Children and grown\nMen._\n\n\n/Young/ children have all their joints small, but they are thick and\nplump in the spaces between them; because there is nothing upon the\nbones at the joints, but some tendons to bind the bones together.The\nsoft flesh, which is full of fluids, is enclosed under the skin in the\nspace between the joints; and as the bones are bigger at the joints\nthan in the space between them, the skin throws off in the progress to\nmanhood that superfluity, and draws nearer to the bones, thinning the\nwhole part together.But upon the joints it does not lessen, as there\nis nothing but cartilages and tendons.For these reasons children are\nsmall in the joints, and plump in the space between, as may be observed\nin their fingers, arms, and narrow shoulders.Men, on the contrary, are\nlarge and full in the joints, in the arms and legs; and where children\nhave hollows, men are knotty and prominent.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.XXXV./--_Of the Joints of the Fingers._\n\n\n/The/ joints of the fingers appear larger on all sides when they\nbend; the more they bend the larger they appear.It is the same in the toes, and it will be more\nperceptible in proportion to their fleshiness.XXXVI./--_Of the Joint of the Wrist._\n\n\n/The/ wrist or joint between the hand and arm lessens on closing the\nhand, and grows larger when it opens.The contrary happens in the arm,\nin the space between the elbow and the hand, on all sides; because in\nopening the hand the muscles are extended and thinned in the arm, from\nthe elbow to the wrist; but when the hand is shut, the same muscles\nswell and shorten.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.The tendons alone start, being stretched by the\nclenching of the hand.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.XXXVII./--_Of the Joint of the Foot._\n\n\n/The/ increase and diminution in the joint of the foot is produced\non that side where the tendons are seen, as D E F, _Plate I._ which\nincreases when the angle is acute, and diminishes when it becomes\nobtuse.It must be understood of the joint in the front part of the\nfoot A B C.XXXVIII./--_Of the Knee._\n\n\n/Of/ all the members which have pliable joints, the knee is the only\none that lessens in the bending, and becomes larger by extension.XXXIX./--_Of the Joints._\n\n\n/All/ the joints of the human body become larger by bending, except\nthat of the leg.XL./--_Of the Naked._\n\n\n/When/ a figure is to appear nimble and delicate, its muscles must\nnever be too much marked, nor are any of them to be much swelled.Because such figures are expressive of activity and swiftness, and are\nnever loaded with much flesh upon the bones.They are made light by the\nwant of flesh, and where there is but little flesh there cannot be any\nthickness of muscles.XLI./--_Of the Thickness of the Muscles._\n\n\n/Muscular/ men have large bones, and are in general thick and short,\nwith very little fat; because the fleshy muscles in their growth\ncontract closer together, and the fat, which in other instances lodges\nbetween them, has no room.The muscles in such thin subjects, not being\nable to extend, grow in thickness, particularly towards their middle,\nin the parts most removed from the extremities.XLII./--_Fat Subjects have small Muscles._\n\n\n/Though/ fat people have this in common with muscular men, that they\nare frequently short and thick, they have thin muscles; but their skin\ncontains a great deal of spongy and soft flesh full of air; for that\nreason they are lighter upon the water, and swim better than muscular\npeople.XLIII./--_Which of the Muscles disappear in the different\nMotions of the Body._\n\n\n/In/ raising or lowering the arm, the pectoral muscles disappear, or\nacquire a greater relievo.A similar effect is produced by the hips,\nwhen they bend either inwards or outwards.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.It is to be observed, that\nthere is more variety of appearances in the shoulders, hips, and neck,\nthan in any other joint, because they are susceptible of the greatest\nvariety of motions.But of this subject I shall make a separate\ntreatise[13].XLIV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles are not to be scrupulously marked all the way, because it\nwould be disagreeable to the sight, and of very difficult execution.But on that side only where the members are in action, they should\nbe pronounced more strongly; for muscles that are at work naturally\ncollect all their parts together, to gain increase of strength, so\nthat some small parts of those muscles will appear, that were not seen\nbefore.XLV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles of young men are not to be marked strongly, nor too much\nswelled, because that would indicate full strength and vigour of age,\nwhich they have not yet attained.Nevertheless they must be more or\nless expressed, as they are more or less employed.For those which are\nin motion are always more swelled and thicker than those which remain\nat rest.The intrinsic and central line of the members which are bent,\nnever retains its natural length.XLVI./--_The Extension and Contraction of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscle at the back part of the thigh shows more variety in\nits extension and contraction, than any other in the human body; the\nsecond, in that respect, are those which compose the buttocks; the\nthird, those of the back; the fourth, those of the neck; the fifth,\nthose of the shoulders; and the sixth, those of the Abdomen, which,\ntaking their rise under the breast, terminate under the lower belly; as\nI shall explain when I speak of each.XLVII./--_Of the Muscle between the Chest and the lower Belly._\n\n\n/There/ is a muscle which begins under the breast at the Sternum, and\nis inserted into, or terminates at the Os pubis, under the lower belly.It is called the Rectus of the Abdomen; it is divided, lengthways,\ninto three principal portions, by transverse tendinous intersections\nor ligaments, viz.the superior part, and a ligament; the second part,\nwith its ligaments; and the third part, with the third ligament;\nwhich last unites by tendons to the Os pubis.These divisions and\nintersections of the same muscle are intended by nature to facilitate\nthe motion when the body is bent or distended.If it were made of one\npiece, it would produce too much variety when extended, or contracted,\nand also would be considerably weaker.When this muscle has but little\nvariety in the motion of the body, it is more beautiful[14].XLVIII./--_Of a Man's complex Strength, but first of the Arm._\n\n\n/The/ muscles which serve either to straighten or bend the arm, arise\nfrom the different processes of the Scapula; some of them from the\nprotuberances of the Humerus, and others about the middle of the Os\nhumeri.The extensors of the arm arise from behind, and the flexors\nfrom before.That a man has more power in pulling than in pushing, has been proved\nby the ninth proposition De Ponderibus[15], where it is said, that of\ntwo equal weights, that will have the greatest power which is farthest\nremoved from the pole or centre of its balance.It follows then of\ncourse, that the muscle N B, _Plate II._ and the muscle N C, being of\nequal power, the inner muscle N C, will nevertheless be stronger than\nthe outward one N B, because it is inserted into the arm at C, a point\nfarther removed from the centre of the elbow A, than B, which is on\nthe other side of such centre, so that that question is determined.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.But this is a simple power, and I thought it best to explain it before\nI mentioned the complex power of the muscles, of which I must now\ntake notice.The complex power, or strength, is, for instance, this,\nwhen the arm is going to act, a second power is added to it (such as\nthe weight of the body and the strength of the legs, in pulling or\npushing), consisting in the extension of the parts, as when two men\nattempt to throw down a column; the one by pushing, and the other by\npulling[16].XLIX./--_In which of the two Actions, Pulling or Pushing, a Man\nhas the greatest Power_, Plate II./A man/ has the greatest power in pulling, for in that action he has\nthe united exertion of all the muscles of the arm, while some of them\nmust be inactive when he is pushing; because when the arm is extended\nfor that purpose, the muscles which move the elbow cannot act, any\nmore than if he pushed with his shoulders against the column he means\nto throw down; in which case only the muscles that extend the back,\nthe legs under the thigh, and the calves of the legs, would be active.From which we conclude, that in pulling there is added to the power\nof extension the strength of the arms, of the legs, of the back, and\neven of the chest, if the oblique motion of the body require it.But\nin pushing, though all the parts were employed, yet the strength of\nthe muscles of the arms is wanting; for to push with an extended arm\nwithout motion does not help more than if a piece of wood were placed\nfrom the shoulder to the column meant to be pushed down._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.L./--_Of the bending of Members, and of the Flesh round the\nbending Joint._\n\n\n/The/ flesh which covers the bones near and at the joints, swells or\ndiminishes in thickness according to their bending or extension; that\nis, it increases at the inside of the angle formed by the bending, and\ngrows narrow and lengthened on the outward side of the exterior angle.The middle between the convex and concave angle participates of this\nincrease or diminution, but in a greater or less degree as the parts\nare nearer to, or farther from, the angles of the bending joints.LI./--_Of the naked Body._\n\n\n/The/ members of naked men who work hard in different attitudes, will\nshew the muscles more strongly on that side where they act forcibly to\nbring the part into action; and the other muscles will be more or less\nmarked, in proportion as they co-operate in the same motion.LII./--_Of a Ligament without Muscles._\n\n\n/Where/ the arm joins with the hand, there is a ligament, the largest\nin the human body, which is without muscles, and is called the strong\nligament of the Carpus; it has a square shape, and serves to bind\nand keep close together the bones of the arm, and the tendons of the\nfingers, and prevent their dilating, or starting out.LIII./--_Of Creases._\n\n\n/In/ bending the joints the flesh will always form a crease on the\nopposite side to that where it is tight.LIV./--_How near behind the Back one Arm can be brought to the\nother_, Plate III./When/ the arms are carried behind the back, the elbows can never be\nbrought nearer than the length from the elbow to the end of the longest\nfinger; so that the fingers will not be seen beyond the elbows, and\nin that situation, the arms with the shoulders form a perfect square.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.The greatest extension of the arm across the chest is, when the elbow\ncomes over the pit of the stomach; the elbow and the shoulder in this\nposition, will form an equilateral triangle.LV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/A naked/ figure being strongly marked, so as to give a distinct view\nof all the muscles, will not express any motion; because it cannot\nmove, if some of its muscles do not relax while the others are pulling.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Those which relax cease to appear in proportion as the others pull\nstrongly and become apparent._London, Published by J.

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "There can be no question of the ineffable superiority of these\nGothic bases, in grace of profile, to any ever invented by the ancients.But they have all two great faults: They seem, in the first place, to\nhave been designed without sufficient reference to the necessity of\ntheir being usually seen from above; their grace of profile cannot be\nestimated when so seen, and their excessive expansion gives them an\nappearance of flatness and separation from the shaft, as if they had\nsplashed out under its pressure: in the second place their cavetto is so\ndeeply cut that it has the appearance of a black fissure between the\nmembers of the base; and in the Lyons and Bourges shafts, 24 and 26, it\nis impossible to conquer the idea suggested by it, that the two stones\nabove and below have been intended to join close, but that some pebbles\nhave got in and kept them from fitting; one is always expecting the\npebbles to be crushed, and the shaft to settle into its place with a\nthunder-clap.For these reasons, I said that the profile of the pure classic\nbase had hardly been materially improved; but the various conditions of\nit are beautiful or commonplace, in proportion to the variety of\nproportion among their lines and the delicacy of their curvatures; that\nis to say, the expression of characters like those of the abstract lines\nin Plate VII.The five best profiles in Plate X. are 10, 17, 19, 20, 21; 10 is\npeculiarly beautiful in the opposition between the bold projection of\nits upper roll, and the delicate leafy curvature of its lower; and this\nand 21 may be taken as nearly perfect types, the one of the steep, the\nother of the expansive basic profiles.The characters of all, however,\nare so dependent upon their place and expression, that it is unfair to\njudge them thus separately; and the precision of curvature is a matter\nof so small consequence in general effect, that we need not here pursue\nthe subject farther.X. We have thus far, however, considered only the lines of moulding\nin the member X b, whether of wall or shaft base.But the reader will\nremember that in our best shaft base, in Fig.78), certain\nprops or spurs were applied to the <DW72> of X b; but now that X b is\ndivided into these delicate mouldings, we cannot conveniently apply the\nspur to its irregular profile; we must be content to set it against the\nlower roll.Let the upper edge of this lower roll be the curved line\nhere, _a_, _d_, _e_, _b_, Fig.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.LIX., and _c_ the angle of the square\nplinth projecting beneath it.Then the spur, applied as we saw in Chap.VII., will be of some such form as the triangle _c e d_, Fig.Now it has just been stated that it is of small importance\nwhether the abstract lines of the profile of a base moulding be fine or\nnot, because we rarely stoop down to look at them.But this triangular\nspur is nearly always seen from above, and the eye is drawn to it as one\nof the most important features of the whole base; therefore it is a point\nof immediate necessity to substitute for its harsh right lines (_c d_,\n_c e_) some curve of noble abstract character.I mentioned, in speaking of the line of the salvia leaf at p.224, that I had marked off the portion of it, _x y_, because I thought\nit likely to be generally useful to us afterwards; and I promised the\nreader that as he had built, so he should decorate his edifice at his\nown free will.If, therefore, he likes the above triangular spur, _c d\ne_, by all means let him keep it; but if he be on the whole dissatisfied\nwith it, I may be permitted, perhaps, to advise him to set to work like\na tapestry bee, to cut off the little bit of line of salvia leaf _x y_,\nand try how he can best substitute it for the awkward lines _c d c e_.He may try it any way that he likes; but if he puts the salvia curvature\ninside the present lines, he will find the spur looks weak, and I think\nhe will determine at last on placing it as I have done at _c d_, _c e_,\nFig.(If the reader will be at the pains to transfer the salvia leaf\nline with tracing paper, he will find it accurately used in this\nfigure.)Then I merely add an outer circular line to represent the outer\nswell of the roll against which the spur is set, and I put another such\nspur to the opposite corner of the square, and we have the half base,\nFig.LX., which is a general type of the best Gothic bases in existence,\nbeing very nearly that of the upper shafts of the Ducal Palace of\nVenice.In those shafts the quadrant _a b_, or the upper edge of the\nlower roll, is 2 feet 1-3/8 inches round, and the base of the spur _d\ne_, is 10 inches; the line _d e_ being therefore to _a b_ as 10 to\n25-3/8.it is as 10 to 24, the measurement being easier and\nthe type somewhat more generally representative of the best, _i.e._\nbroadest, spurs of Italian Gothic.Now, the reader is to remember, there is nothing magical in\nsalvia leaves: the line I take from them happened merely to fall\nconveniently on the page, and might as well have been taken from\nanything else; it is simply its character of gradated curvature which\nfits it for our use.On Plate XI., opposite, I have given plans of the\nspurs and quadrants of twelve Italian and three Northern bases; these\nlatter (13), from Bourges, (14) from Lyons, (15) from Rouen, are given\nmerely to show the Northern disposition to break up bounding lines, and\nlose breadth in picturesqueness.These Northern bases look the prettiest\nin this plate, because this variation of the outline is nearly all the\nornament they have, being cut very rudely; but the Italian bases above\nthem are merely prepared by their simple outlines for far richer\ndecoration at the next step, as we shall see presently.The Northern\nbases are to be noted also for another grand error: the projection of\nthe roll beyond the square plinth, of which the corner is seen, in\nvarious degrees of advancement, in the three examples.13 is the base\nwhose profile is No.26 in Plate X.; 14 is 24 in the same plate; and 15\nis 28.The Italian bases are the following; all, except 7 and 10, being\nVenetian: 1 and 2, upper colonnade, St.Mark's; 3, Ca' Falier; 4, lower\ncolonnade, and 5, transept, St.Mark's; 6, from the Church of St.John\nand Paul; 7, from the tomb near St.Anastasia, Verona, described above\n(p.142); 8 and 9, Fon daco de' Turchi, Venice; 10, tomb of Can Mastino\ndella Scala, Verona; 11, San Stefano, Venice; 12, Ducal Palace, Venice,\nupper colonnade.3, 8, 9, 11 are the bases whose profiles are\nrespectively Nos.18, 11, 13, and 20 in Plate X. The flat surfaces of\nthe basic plinths are here shaded; and in the lower corner of the square\noccupied by each quadrant is put, also shaded, the central profile of\neach spur, from its root at the roll of the base to its point; those of\nNos.1 and 2 being conjectural, for their spurs were so rude and ugly,\nthat I took no note of their profiles; but they would probably be as\nhere given.As these bases, though here, for the sake of comparison,\nreduced within squares of equal size, in reality belong to shafts of\nvery different size, 9 being some six or seven inches in diameter,\nand 6, three or four feet, the proportionate size of the roll varies\naccordingly, being largest, as in 9, where the base is smallest, and in\n6 and 12 the leaf profile is given on a larger scale than the plan, or\nits character could not have been exhibited.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.Now, in all these spurs, the reader will observe that the\nnarrowest are for the most part the earliest.2, from the upper\ncolonnade of St.Mark's, is the only instance I ever saw of the double\nspur, as transitive between the square and octagon plinth; the truncated\nform, 1, is also rare and very ugly.3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 are the\ngeneral conditions of the Byzantine spur; 8 is a very rare form of plan\nin Byzantine work, but proved to be so by its rude level profile; while\n7, on the contrary, Byzantine in plan, is eminently Gothic in the\nprofile.9 to 12 are from formed Gothic buildings, equally refined in\ntheir profile and plan.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.The character of the profile is indeed much altered by the\naccidental nature of the surface decoration; but the importance of the\nbroad difference between the raised and flat profile will be felt on\nglancing at the examples 1 to 6 in Plate XII.The three upper examples\nare the Romanesque types, which occur as parallels with the Byzantine\ntypes, 1 to 3 of Plate XI.Their plans would be nearly the same; but\ninstead of resembling flat leaves, they are literally spurs, or claws,\nas high as they are broad; and the third, from St.Michele of Pavia,\nappears to be intended to have its resemblance to a claw enforced by the\ntransverse fillet.Ambrogio, Milan; 2 from Vienne, France.The 4th type, Plate XII., almost like the extremity of a man's foot, is\na Byzantine form (perhaps worn on the edges), from the nave of St.Mark's; and the two next show the unity of the two principles, forming\nthe perfect Italian Gothic types,--5, from tomb of Can Signorio della\nScala, Verona; 6, from San Stefano, Venice (the base 11 of Plate XI., in\nperspective).The two other bases, 10 and 12 of Plate XI., are\nconditions of the same kind, showing the varieties of rise and fall in\nexquisite modulation; the 10th, a type more frequent at Verona than\nVenice, in which the spur profile overlaps the roll, instead of rising\nout of it, and seems to hold it down, as if it were a ring held by\nsockets.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.This is a character found both in early and late work; a kind\nof band, or fillet, appears to hold, and even compress, the _centre_ of\nthe roll in the base of one of the crypt shafts of St.Peter's, Oxford,\nwhich has also spurs at its angles; and long bands flow over the base of\nthe angle shaft of the Ducal Palace of Venice, next the Porta della\nCarta.When the main contours of the base are once determined, its\ndecoration is as easy as it is infinite.I have merely given, in Plate\nXII., three examples to which I shall need to refer, hereafter.9 is\na very early and curious one; the decoration of the base 6 in Plate XI.,\nrepresenting a leaf turned over and flattened down; or, rather, the idea\nof the turned leaf, worked as well as could be imagined on the flat\ncontour of the spur.Then 10 is the perfect, but simplest possible\ndevelopment of the same idea, from the earliest bases of the upper\ncolonnade of the Ducal Palace, that is to say, the bases of the sea\nfacade; and 7 and 8 are its lateral profile and transverse section.Finally, 11 and 12 are two of the spurs of the later shafts of the same\ncolonnade on the Piazzetta side (No.11 occurs on\none of these shafts only, and is singularly beautiful.I suspect it to\nbe earlier than the other, which is the characteristic base of the rest\nof the series, and already shows the loose, sensual, ungoverned\ncharacter of fifteenth century ornament in the dissoluteness of its\nrolling.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.I merely give these as examples ready to my hand, and\nnecessary for future reference; not as in anywise representative of the\nvariety of the Italian treatment of the general contour, far less of the\nendless caprices of the North.The most beautiful base I ever saw, on the\nwhole, is a Byzantine one in the Baptistery of St.Mark's, in which the\nspur profile approximates to that of No.; but it is formed\nby a cherub, who sweeps downwards on the wing.His two wings, as they half\nclose, form the upper part of the spur, and the rise of it in the front\nis formed by exactly the action of Alichino, swooping on the pitch lake:\n\"quei drizzo, volando, suso il petto.\"But it requires noble management\nto confine such a fancy within such limits.The greater number of the\nbest bases are formed of leaves; and the reader may amuse himself as he\nwill by endless inventions of them, from types which he may gather among\nthe weeds at the nearest roadside.The value of the vegetable form is\nespecially here, as above noted, Chap.XXXII., its capability\nof unity with the mass of the base, and of being suggested by few lines;\nnone but the Northern Gothic architects are able to introduce entire\nanimal forms in this position with perfect success.There is a beautiful\ninstance at the north door of the west front of Rouen; a lizard pausing\nand curling himself round a little in the angle; one expects him the\nnext instant to lash round the shaft and vanish: and we may with\nadvantage compare this base with those of Renaissance Scuola di San\nRocca[79] at Venice, in which the architect, imitating the mediaeval\nbases, which he did not understand, has put an elephant, four inches\nhigher, in the same position.I have not in this chapter spoken at all of the profiles which\nare given in Northern architecture to the projections of the lower\nmembers of the base, _b_ and _c_ in Fig.II., nor of the methods in\nwhich both these, and the rolls of the mouldings in Plate X., are\ndecorated, especially in Roman architecture, with superadded chain work\nor chasing of various patterns.Of the first I have not spoken, because\nI shall have no occasion to allude to them in the following essay; nor\nof the second, because I consider them barbarisms.Decorated rolls and\ndecorated ogee profiles, such, for instance, as the base of the Arc de\nl'Etoile at Paris, are among the richest and farthest refinements of\ndecorative appliances; and they ought always to be reserved for jambs,\ncornices, and archivolts: if you begin with them in the base, you have\nno power of refining your decorations as you ascend, and, which is still\nworse, you put your most delicate work on the jutting portions of the\nfoundation,--the very portions which are most exposed to abrasion.The\nbest expression of a base is that of stern endurance,--the look of being\nable to bear roughing; or, if the whole building is so delicate that no\none can be expected to treat even its base with unkindness,[80] then at\nleast the expression of quiet, prefatory simplicity.The angle spur may\nreceive such decoration as we have seen, because it is one of the most\nimportant features in the whole building; and the eye is always so\nattracted to it that it cannot be in rich architecture left altogether\nblank; the eye is stayed upon it by its position, but glides, and ought\nto glide, along the basic rolls to take measurement of their length: and\neven with all this added fitness, the ornament of the basic spur is\nbest, in the long run, when it is boldest and simplest.XVIII., as the most beautiful I ever saw, was not for that\nreason the best I ever saw: beautiful in its place, in a quiet corner of\na Baptistery sheeted with jasper and alabaster, it would have<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.", "question": "Where is Mary?

No subject has been more open ground of dispute among architects\nthan the decoration of the wall veil, because no decoration appeared\nnaturally to grow out of its construction; nor could any curvatures be\ngiven to its surface large enough to produce much impression on the eye.It has become, therefore, a kind of general field for experiments of\nvarious effects of surface ornament, or has been altogether abandoned to\nthe mosaicist and fresco painter.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.But we may perhaps conclude, from what\nwas advanced in the Fifth Chapter, that there is one kind of decoration\nwhich will, indeed, naturally follow on its construction.For it is\nperfectly natural that the different kinds of stone used in its\nsuccessive courses should be of different colors; and there are many\nassociations and analogies which metaphysically justify the introduction\nof horizontal bands of color, or of light and shade.They are, in the\nfirst place, a kind of expression of the growth or age of the wall, like\nthe rings in the wood of a tree; then they are a farther symbol of the\nalternation of light and darkness, which was above noted as the source\nof the charm of many inferior mouldings: again, they are valuable as an\nexpression of horizontal space to the imagination, space of which the\nconception is opposed, and gives more effect by its opposition, to the\nenclosing power of the wall itself (this I spoke of as probably the\ngreat charm of these horizontal bars to the Arabian mind): and again\nthey are valuable in their suggestion of the natural courses of rocks,\nand beds of the earth itself.And to all these powerful imaginative\nreasons we have to add the merely ocular charm of interlineal opposition\nof color; a charm so great, that all the best colorists, without a\nsingle exception, depend upon it for the most piquant of their pictorial\neffects, some vigorous mass of alternate stripes or bars of color being\nmade central in all their richest arrangements.The whole system of\nTintoret's great picture of the Miracle of St.Mark is poised on the\nbars of blue, which cross the white turban of the executioner.There are, therefore, no ornaments more deeply suggestive in\ntheir simplicity than these alternate bars of horizontal colors; nor do\nI know any buildings more noble than those of the Pisan Romanesque, in\nwhich they are habitually employed; and certainly none so graceful, so\nattractive, so enduringly delightful in their nobleness.Yet, of this\npure and graceful ornamentation, Professor Willis says, \"a practice more\ndestructive of architectural grandeur can hardly be conceived:\" and\nmodern architects have substituted for it the ingenious ornament of\nwhich the reader has had one specimen above, Fig.61, and with\nwhich half the large buildings in London are disfigured, or else\ntraversed by mere straight lines, as, for instance, the back of the\nBank.The lines on the Bank may, perhaps, be considered typical of\naccounts; but in general the walls, if left destitute of them, would\nhave been as much fairer than the walls charged with them, as a sheet of\nwhite paper is than the leaf of a ledger.But that the reader may have\nfree liberty of judgment in this matter, I place two examples of the old\nand the Renaissance ornament side by side on the opposite page.That on\nthe right is Romanesque, from St.Pietro of Pistoja; that on the left,\nmodern English, from the Arthur Club-house, St.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.But why, it will be asked, should the lines which mark the\ndivision of the stones be wrong when they are chiselled, and right when\nthey are marked by color?First, because the color separation is a\nnatural one.You build with different kinds of stone, of which,\nprobably, one is more costly than another; which latter, as you cannot\nconstruct your building of it entirely, you arrange in conspicuous bars.But the chiselling of the stones is a wilful throwing away of time and\nlabor in defacing the building: it costs much to hew one of those\nmonstrous blocks into shape; and, when it is done, the building is\n_weaker_ than it was before, by just as much stone as has been cut away\nfrom its joints.And, secondly, because, as I have repeatedly urged,\nstraight lines are ugly things as _lines_, but admirable as limits of\n spaces; and the joints of the stones, which are painful in\nproportion to their regularity, if drawn as lines, are perfectly\nagreeable when marked by variations of hue.What is true of the divisions of stone by chiselling, is equally\ntrue of divisions of bricks by pointing.Nor, of course, is the mere\nhorizontal bar the only arrangement in which the colors of brickwork or\nmasonry can be gracefully disposed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.It is rather one which can only be\nemployed with advantage when the courses of stone are deep and bold.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.When the masonry is small, it is better to throw its colors into\nchequered patterns.We shall have several interesting examples to study\nin Venice besides the well-known one of the Ducal Palace.The town of\nMoulins, in France, is one of the most remarkable on this side the Alps\nfor its chequered patterns in bricks.The church of Christchurch,\nStreatham, lately built, though spoiled by many grievous errors (the\niron work in the campanile being the grossest), yet affords the\ninhabitants of the district a means of obtaining some idea of the\nvariety of effects which are possible with no other material than brick.V. We have yet to notice another effort of the Renaissance architects\nto adorn the blank spaces of their walls by what is called Rustication.There is sometimes an obscure trace of the remains of the imitation of\nsomething organic in this kind of work.In some of the better French\neighteenth century buildings it has a distinctly floral character, like\na final degradation of Flamboyant leafage; and some of our modern\nEnglish architects appear to have taken the decayed teeth of elephants\nfor their type; but, for the most part, it resembles nothing so much as\nworm casts; nor these with any precision.If it did, it would not bring\nit within the sphere of our properly imitative ornamentation.I thought\nit unnecessary to warn the reader that he was not to copy forms of\nrefuse or corruption; and that, while he might legitimately take the\nworm or the reptile for a subject of imitation, he was not to study the\nworm cast or coprolite.It is, however, I believe, sometimes supposed that rustication\ngives an appearance of solidity to foundation stones.Not so; at least\nto any one who knows the look of a hard stone.You may, by rustication,\nmake your good marble or granite look like wet slime, honeycombed by\nsand-eels, or like half-baked tufo covered with slow exudation of\nstalactite, or like rotten claystone coated with concretions of its own\nmud; but not like the stones of which the hard world is built.Do not\nthink that nature rusticates her foundations.Smooth sheets of rock,\nglistening like sea waves, and that ring under the hammer like a brazen\nbell,--that is her preparation for first stories.She does rusticate\nsometimes: crumbly sand-stones, with their ripple-marks filled with red\nmud; dusty lime-stones, which the rains wash into labyrinthine cavities;\nspongy lavas, which the volcano blast drags hither and thither into ropy\ncoils and bubbling hollows;--these she rusticates, indeed, when she\nwants to make oyster-shells and magnesia of them; but not when she needs\nto lay foundations with them.Then she seeks the polished surface and\niron heart, not rough looks and incoherent substance.Of the richer modes of wall decoration it is impossible to\ninstitute any general comparison; they are quite infinite, from mere\ninlaid geometrical figures up to incrustations of elaborate bas-relief.The architect has perhaps more license in them, and more power of\nproducing good effect with rude design than in any other features of the\nbuilding; the chequer and hatchet work of the Normans and the rude\nbas-reliefs of the Lombards being almost as satisfactory as the delicate\npanelling and mosaic of the Duomo of Florence.But this is to be noted\nof all good wall ornament, that it retains the expression of firm and\nmassive substance, and of broad surface, and that architecture instantly\ndeclined when linear design was substituted for massive, and the sense\nof weight of wall was lost in a wilderness of upright or undulating\nrods.Of the richest and most delicate wall veil decoration by inlaid\nwork, as practised in Italy from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, I\nhave given the reader two characteristic examples in Plates XX.There are, however, three spaces in which the wall veil,\npeculiarly limited in shape, was always felt to be fitted for surface\ndecoration of the most elaborate kind; and in these spaces are found the\nmost majestic instances of its treatment, even to late periods.One of\nthese is the spandril space, or the filling between any two arches,\ncommonly of the shape _a_, Fig.; the half of which, or the flank\nfilling of any arch, is called a spandril.In Chapter XVII., on Filling\nof Apertures, the reader will find another of these spaces noted, called\nthe tympanum, and commonly of the form _b_, Fig.: and finally, in\nChapter XVIII., he will find the third space described, that between an\narch and its protecting gable, approximating generally to the form _c_,\nFig.The methods of treating these spaces might alone furnish subject\nfor three very interesting essays; but I shall only note the most\nessential points respecting them.It was observed in Chapter XII., that this portion of\nthe arch load might frequently be lightened with great advantage by\npiercing it with a circle, or with a group of circles; and the roof of\nthe Euston Square railroad station was adduced as an example.One of the\nspandril decorations of Bayeux Cathedral is given in the \"Seven Lamps,\"\nPlate VII.It is little more than one of these Euston Square\nspandrils, with its circles foliated.SPANDRIL DECORATION\n               THE DUCAL PALACE.]Sometimes the circle is entirely pierced; at other times it is merely\nsuggested by a mosaic or light tracery on the wall surface, as in the\nplate opposite, which is one of the spandrils of the Ducal Palace at\nVenice.It was evidently intended that all the spandrils of this\nbuilding should be decorated in this manner, but only two of them seem\nto have been completed.X. The other modes of spandril filling may be broadly reduced to four\nheads.Free figure sculpture, as in the Chapter-house of Salisbury,\nand very superbly along the west front of Bourges, the best Gothic\nspandrils I know.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.Radiated foliage, more or less referred to the\ncentre, or to the bottom of the spandril for its origin; single figures\nwith expanded wings often answering the same purpose.Trefoils; and\n4, ordinary wall decoration continued into the spandril space, as in\nPlate XIII., above, from St.Pietro at Pistoja, and in Westminster\nAbbey.The Renaissance architects introduced spandril fillings composed\nof colossal human figures reclining on the sides of the arch, in\nprecarious lassitude; but these cannot come under the head of wall veil\ndecoration.It was noted that, in Gothic architecture,\nthis is for the most part a detached slab of stone, having no\nconstructional relation to the rest of the building.The plan of its\nsculpture is therefore quite arbitrary; and, as it is generally in a\nconspicuous position, near the eye, and above the entrance, it is almost\nalways charged with a series of rich figure sculptures, solemn in feeling\nand consecutive in subject.It occupies in Christian sacred edifices very\nnearly the position of the pediment in Greek sculpture.This latter is\nitself a kind of tympanum, and charged with sculpture in the same\nmanner.The same principles apply to it which have been\nnoted respecting the spandril, with one more of some importance.The\nchief difficulty in treating a gable lies in the excessive sharpness of\nits upper point.It may, indeed, on its outside apex, receive a finial;\nbut the meeting of the inside lines of its terminal mouldings is\nnecessarily both harsh and conspicuous, unless artificially concealed.The most beautiful victory I have ever seen obtained over this\ndifficulty was by placing a sharp shield, its point, as usual,\ndownwards, at the apex of the gable, which exactly reversed the\noffensive lines, yet without actually breaking them; the gable being\ncompleted behind the shield.The same thing is done in the Northern and\nSouthern Gothic: in the porches of Abbeville and the tombs of Verona.I believe there is little else to be noted of general laws\nof ornament respecting the wall veil.We have next to consider its\ncon", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Now the principal beauty of a shaft is its perfect proportion to its\nwork,--its exact expression of necessary strength.If this has been\ntruly attained, it will hardly need, in some cases hardly bear, more\ndecoration than is given to it by its own rounding and taper curvatures;\nfor, if we cut ornaments in intaglio on its surface, we weaken it; if we\nleave them in relief, we overcharge it, and the sweep of the line from\nits base to its summit, though deduced in Chapter VIII., from\nnecessities of construction, is already one of gradated curvature, and\nof high decorative value.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.It is, however, carefully to be noted, that decorations are\nadmissible on colossal and on diminutive shafts, which are wrong upon\nthose of middle size.For, when the shaft is enormous, incisions or\nsculpture on its sides (unless colossal also), do not materially\ninterfere with the sweep of its curve, nor diminish the efficiency of\nits sustaining mass.And if it be diminutive, its sustaining function is\ncomparatively of so small importance, the injurious results of failure\nso much less, and the relative strength and cohesion of its mass so much\ngreater, that it may be suffered in the extravagance of ornament or\noutline which would be unendurable in a shaft of middle size, and\nimpossible in one of colossal.Thus, the shafts drawn in Plate XIII., of\nthe \"Seven Lamps,\" though given as examples of extravagance, are yet\npleasing in the general effect of the arcade they support; being each\nsome six or seven feet high.But they would have been monstrous, as\nwell as unsafe, if they had been sixty or seventy.Therefore, to determine the general rule for shaft decoration,\nwe must ascertain the proportions representative of the mean bulk of\nshafts: they might easily be calculated from a sufficient number of\nexamples, but it may perhaps be assumed, for our present general\npurpose, that the mean standard would be of some twenty feet in height,\nby eight or nine in circumference: then this will be the size on which\ndecoration is most difficult and dangerous: and shafts become more and\nmore fit subjects for decoration, as they rise farther above, or fall\nfarther beneath it, until very small and very vast shafts will both be\nfound to look blank unless they receive some chasing or imagery; blank,\nwhether they support a chair or table on the one side, or sustain a\nvillage on the ridge of an Egyptian architrave on the other.Of the various ornamentation of colossal shafts, there are no\nexamples so noble as the Egyptian; these the reader can study in Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.Roberts' work on Egypt nearly as well, I imagine, as if he were beneath\ntheir shadow, one of their chief merits, as examples of method, being\nthe perfect decision and visibility of their designs at the necessary\ndistance: contrast with these the incrustations of bas-relief on the\nTrajan pillar, much interfering with the smooth lines of the shaft, and\nyet themselves untraceable, if not invisible.On shafts of middle size, the only ornament which has ever been\naccepted as right, is the Doric fluting, which, indeed, gave the effect\nof a succession of unequal lines of shade, but lost much of the repose\nof the cylindrical gradation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.The Corinthian fluting, which is a mean\nmultiplication and deepening of the Doric, with a square instead of a\nsharp ridge between each hollow, destroyed the serenity of the shaft\naltogether, and is always rigid and meagre.Both are, in fact, wrong in\nprinciple; they are an elaborate weakening[83] of the shaft, exactly\nopposed (as above shown) to the ribbed form, which is the result of a\ngroup of shafts bound together, and which is especially beautiful when\nspecial service is given to each member.On shafts of inferior size, every species of decoration may be\nwisely lavished, and in any quantity, so only that the form of the shaft\nbe clearly visible.But the\ngrandmother had strictly forbidden the very mention of his name; her\nmind was set only upon extending Kampen and making it their own\nproperty, so that Margit and the boy might be independent.Taking\nadvantage of the landowner's poverty, she bought the place, paid off\npart of the purchase-money every year, and managed her farm like a\nman; for she had been a widow fourteen years.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Under her care, Kampen\nhad been extended till it could now feed four cows, sixteen sheep,\nand a horse of which she was joint owner.Meantime, Nils, the tailor, continued to go about working in the\nparish; but he had less to do than formerly, partly because he was\nless attentive to his trade, and partly because he was not so well\nliked.Then he took to going out oftener to play the fiddle at\nparties; this gave him more opportunities for drinking, and thus came\nmore fighting and miserable days.One winter day, when Arne was about six years old, he was playing on\nthe bed, where he had set up the coverlet for a boat-sail, while he\nsat steering with a ladle.The grandmother sat in the room spinning,\nbusy with her own thoughts, and every now and then nodding, as though\nin affirmation of her own conclusions.Then the boy knew she was\ntaking no notice of him; and so he sang, just as he had learned it, a\nwild, rough song about Nils, the tailor:--\n\n   \"Unless 'twas only yesterday, hither first you came,\n    You've surely heard already of Nils, the tailor's fame.Unless 'twas but this morning, you came among us first,\n    You've heard how he knocked over tall Johan Knutson Kirst;\n\n    How in his famous barn-fight with Ola Stor-Johann,\n    He said, 'Bring down your porridge when we two fight again.'That fighting fellow, Bugge, a famous man was he:\n    His name was known all over fiord and fell and sea.'Now, choose the place, you tailor, where I shall knock you down;\n    And then I'll spit upon it, and there I'll lay your crown.''Ah, only come so near, I may catch your scent, my man:\n    Your bragging hurts nobody; don't dream it ever can.'The first round was a poor one, and neither man could beat;\n    But both kept in their places, and steady on their feet.The second round, poor Bugge was beaten black and blue.The third round, Bugge tumbled, and bleeding there he lay.'Now, Bugge, where's your bragging?'This was all the boy sang; but there were two verses more which the\nmother had never taught him.The grandmother knew these last verses\nonly too well; and she remembered them all the better because the boy\ndid not sing them.She said nothing to him, however, but to the\nmother, she said, \"If you think it well to teach him the first\nverses, don't forget to teach him the last ones, too.\"Nils, the tailor, was so broken down by his drinking, that he was not\nlike the same man; and people began to say he would soon be utterly\nruined.About this time a wedding was celebrated in the neighborhood, and two\nAmerican gentlemen, who were visiting near, came to witness it, as\nthey wished to see the customs of the country.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Nils played; and the\ntwo gentlemen each gave a dollar for him, and then asked for the\n_halling_.But no one came forward to dance it; and several begged\nNils himself to come: \"After all, he was still the best dancer,\" they\nsaid.He refused; but their request became still more urgent, and at\nlast all in the room joined in it.This was just what he wanted; and\nat once he handed his fiddle to another man, took off his jacket and\ncap, and stepped smilingly into the middle of the room.They all came\nround to look at him, just as they used to do in his better days, and\nthis gave him back his old strength.They crowded closely together,\nthose farthest back standing on tables and benches.Several of the\ngirls stood higher than all the rest; and the foremost of them--a\ntall girl, with bright auburn hair, blue eyes, deeply set under a\nhigh forehead, and thin lips, which often smiled and then drew a\nlittle to one side--was Birgit Boeen: Nils caught her eye as he\nglanced upwards at the beam.The music struck up; a deep silence\nensued; and he began.He squatted on the floor, and hopped sidewards\nin time with the music; swung from one side to another, crossed, and\nuncrossed his legs under him several times; sprang up again, and\nstood as though he were going to take a leap; but then shirked it,\nand went on hopping sidewards as before.The fiddle was skilfully\nplayed, and the tune became more and more exciting.Nils gradually\nthrew his head backwarder, and then suddenly kicked the beam,\nscattering the dust from the ceiling down upon the people below.They\nlaughed and shouted round him, and the girls stood almost breathless.The sound of the violin rose high above the noise, stimulating him by\nstill wilder notes, and he did not resist their influence.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.He bent\nforward; hopped in time with the music; stood up as though he were\ngoing to take a leap, but shirked it, swung from one side to the\nother as before; and just when he looked as if he had not the least\nthought of leaping, leaped up and kicked the beam again and again.Next he turned somersaults forwards and backwards, coming upon his\nfeet firmly, and standing up quite straight each time.Then he\nsuddenly left off; and the tune, after running through some wild\nvariations, died away in one long, deep note on the bass.The crowd\ndispersed, and an animated conversation in loud tones followed the\nsilence.Nils leaned against the wall; and the American gentlemen,\nwith their interpreter, went over to him, each giving him five\ndollars.The Americans said a few words aside to their interpreter, who then\nasked Nils whether he would go with them as their servant.Nils asked, while the people crowded round as closely as possible.\"Out into the world,\" was the answer.Nils asked, as he\nlooked round him with a bright face; his eyes fell on Birgit Boeen,\nand he did not take them off again.\"In a week's time when they come\nback here,\" answered the interpreter.\"Well, perhaps I may then be\nready,\" said Nils, weighing his ten dollars, and trembling so\nviolently, that a man on whose shoulder he was resting one arm, asked\nhim to sit down.\"Oh, it's nothing,\" he answered, and he took a few faltering steps\nacross the floor, then, some firmer ones, turned round, and asked for\na springing-dance.He looked slowly round, and\nthen went straight over to one in a dark  skirt: it was Birgit\nBoeen.He stretched forth his hand, and she gave both hers; but he\ndrew back with a laugh, took out a girl who stood next, and danced\noff gaily.Birgit's face and neck flushed crimson; and in a moment a\ntall, mild-looking man, who was standing behind her, took her hand\nand danced away with her just after Nils.He saw them, and whether\npurposely or not, pushed against them so violently that they both\nfell heavily to the floor.Loud cries and laughter were heard all\nround.Birgit rose, went aside, and cried bitterly.Her partner rose more slowly, and went straight over to Nils, who was\nstill dancing: \"You must stop a little,\" he said.Nils did not hear;\nso the other man laid hold on his arm.He tore himself away, looked\nat the man, and said with a smile, \"I don't know you.\"\"P'r'aps not; but now I'll let you know who I am,\" said the man,\ngiving him a blow just over one eye.Nils was quite unprepared for\nthis, and fell heavily on the sharp edge of the fireplace.He tried\nto rise, but he could not: his spine was broken.At Kampen, a change had taken place.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.Of late the grandmother had\nbecome more infirm, and as she felt her strength failing, she took\ngreater pains than ever to save money to pay off the remaining debt\nupon the farm.\"Then you and the boy,\" she used to say to Margit,\n\"will be comfortably off.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.And mind, if ever you bring anybody into\nthe place to ruin it for you, I shall turn in my grave.\"In\nharvest-time, she had the great satisfaction of going up to the late\nlandowner's house with the last of the money due to him; and happy\nshe felt when, seated once more in the porch at home, she could at\nlast say, \"Now it's done.\"But in that same hour she was seized with\nher last illness; she went to bed at once, and rose no more.Margit\nhad her buried in the churchyard, and a nice headstone was set over\nher, inscribed with her name and age, and a verse from one of\nKingo's hymns.A fortnight after her burial, her black Sunday gown\nwas made into a suit of clothes for the boy; and when he was dressed\nin them he became as grave as even the grandmother herself.He went\nof his own accord and took up the book with clasps and large print\nfrom which she used to read and sing every Sunday; he opened it, and\nthere he found her spectacles.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.These he had never been allowed to\ntouch while she was living; now he took them out half fearfully,\nplaced them over his nose, and looked down through them into the\nbook.\"How strange this is,\" he thought; \"it was\nthrough them grandmother could read God's word!\"He held them high up\nagainst the light to see what was the matter, and--the spectacles\ndropped on the floor, broken in twenty pieces.He was much frightened, and when at the same moment the door opened,\nhe felt as if it must be the grandmother herself who was coming in.But it was the mother, and behind her came six men, who, with much\nstamping and noise, brought in a litter which they placed in the\nmiddle of the room.The door was left open so long after them, that\nthe room grew quite cold.On the litter lay a man with a pale face and dark hair.The mother\nwalked to and fro and wept.\"Be careful how you lay him on the bed,\"\nshe said imploringly, helping them herself.But all the while the men\nwere moving him, something grated beneath their feet.\"Ah, that's\nonly grandmother's spectacles,\" the boy thought; but he said\nnothing.It was, as we have said before, just harvest-time.A week after the\nday when Nils had been carried into Margit Kampen's house, the\nAmerican gentlemen sent him word to get ready to go with them.He was\njust then lying writhing under a violent attack of pain; and,\nclenching his teeth, he cried, \"Let them go to the devil!\"Margit\nremained waiting, as if she had not received any answer; he noticed\nthis, and after a while he repeated, faintly and slowly, \"Let\nthem--go.\"As the winter advanced, he recovered so far as to be able to get up,\nthough his health was broken for life.The first day he could get up\nhe took his fiddle and tuned it; but it excited him so much that he\nhad to go to bed again.He talked very little, but was gentle and\nkind, and soon he began to read with Arne, and to take in work.Still\nhe never went out; and he did not talk to those who came to see him.At first Margit used to tell him the news of the parish, but it made\nhim gloomy, and so she soon left off.When spring came he and Margit often sat longer than usual talking\ntogether after supper, when Arne had been sent to bed.Later in the\nseason the banns of marriage were published for them, and then they\nwere quietly married.He worked on the farm, and managed wisely and steadily; and Margit\nsaid", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Margit had even in the midst of her trouble remained tolerably stout.She had rosy cheeks, large eyes, surrounded by dark circles which\nmade them seem still larger, full lips, and a round face; and she\nlooked healthy and strong, although she really had not much strength.Now, she looked better than ever; and she always sang at her work,\njust as she used to do.Then one Sunday afternoon, the father and son went out to see how\nthings were getting on in the fields.Arne ran about, shooting with a\nbow and arrows, which the father had himself made for him.Thus, they\nwent on straight towards the road which led past the church, and down\nto the place which was called the broad valley.When they came there,\nNils sat down on a stone and fell into a reverie, while Arne went on\nshooting, and running for his arrows along the road in the direction\nof the church.\"Only not too far away,\" Nils said.Just as Arne was\nat the height of his play, he stopped, listening, and called out,\n\"Father, I hear music.\"Nils, too, listened; and they heard the sound\nof violins, sometimes drowned by loud, wild shouts, while above all\nrose the rattling of wheels, and the trampling of horses' hoofs: it\nwas a bridal train coming home from the church.\"Come here, lad,\" the\nfather said, in a tone which made Arne feel he must come quickly.The\nfather had risen hastily, and now stood hidden behind a large tree.Arne followed till the father called out, \"Not here, but go yonder!\"Then the boy ran behind an elm-copse.The train of carriages had\nalready turned the corner of the birch-wood; the horses, white with\nfoam, galloping at a furious rate, while drunken people shouted and\nhallooed.The father and Arne counted the carriages one after\nanother: there were fourteen.In the first, two fiddlers were\nsitting; and the wedding tune sounded merrily through the clear air:\na lad stood behind driving.In the next carriage sat the bride, with\nher crown and ornaments glittering in the sunshine.She was tall, and\nwhen she smiled her mouth drew a little to one side; with her sat a\nmild-looking man, dressed in blue.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.Then came the rest of the\ncarriages, the men sitting on the women's laps, and little boys\nbehind; drunken men riding six together in a one-horse carriage;\nwhile in the last sat the purveyor of the feast, with a cask of\nbrandy in his arms.They drove rapidly past Nils and Arne, shouting\nand singing down the hill; while behind them the breeze bore upwards,\nthrough a cloud of dust, the sound of the violins, the cries, and the\nrattling of the wheels, at first loud, then fainter and fainter, till\nat last it died away in the distance.Nils remained standing\nmotionless till he heard a little rustling behind him; then he turned\nround: it was Arne stealing forth from his hiding-place.he asked; but then he started back a little,\nfor Nils' face had an evil look.The boy stood silently, waiting for\nan answer; but he got none; and at last, becoming impatient, he\nventured to ask, \"Are we going now?\"Nils was still standing\nmotionless, looking dreamily in the direction where the bridal train\nhad gone; then he collected himself, and walked homewards.Arne\nfollowed, and once more began to shoot and to run after his arrows.\"Don't trample down the meadow,\" said Nils abruptly.The boy let the\narrow lie and came back; but soon he forgot the warning, and, while\nthe father once more stood still, he lay down to make somersaults.\"Don't trample down the meadow, I say,\" repeated Nils, seizing his\narm and snatching him up by it almost violently enough to sprain it.At the door Margit stood waiting for them.She had just come from the\ncow-house, where it seemed she had been working hard, for her hair\nwas rough, her linen soiled, and her dress untidy; but she stood in\nthe doorway smiling.\"Red-side has calved,\" she said; \"and never in\nall my life did I see such a great calf.\"\"I think you might make yourself a little tidy of a Sunday,\" said\nNils as he went past her into the room.\"Yes, now the work's done, there'll be time for dressing,\" answered\nMargit, following him: and she began to dress, singing meanwhile.Margit now sang very well, though sometimes her voice was a little\nhoarse.\"Leave off that screaming,\" said Nils, throwing himself upon the bed.Then the boy came bustling in, all out of breath.\"The calf, the calf's got red marks on each side and a spot on the\nforehead, just like his mother.\"cried Nils, putting down one of his feet\nfrom the bed, and stamping on the floor.\"The deuce is in that\nbustling boy,\" he growled out, drawing up his foot again.\"You can see very well father's out of spirits to-day,\" the mother\nsaid to Arne, by way of warning.\"Shouldn't you like some strong\ncoffee with treacle?\"she then said, turning to Nils, trying to drive\naway his ill-temper.Coffee with treacle had been a favorite drink\nwith the grandmother and Margit, and Arne liked it too.But Nils\nnever liked it, though he used to take it with the others.\"Shouldn't\nyou like some strong coffee with treacle?\"Margit asked again, for he\ndid not answer the first time.Now, he raised himself on his elbows,\nand cried in a loud, harsh voice, \"Do you think I'll guzzle that\nfilthy stuff?\"Margit was thunder-struck; and she went out, taking the boy with her.They had several things to do out-doors, and they did not come in\ntill supper-time; then Nils had gone.Arne was sent out into the\nfield to call him, but could not find him anywhere.They waited till\nthe supper was nearly cold; but Nils had not come even when it was\nfinished.Then Margit grew fidgety, sent Arne to bed, and sat down,\nwaiting.\"That's no business of yours,\" he answered, seating himself slowly on\nthe bench.From that time he often went out into the parish; and he was always\ndrunk when he came back.\"I can't bear stopping at home with you,\" he\nonce said when he came in.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.She gently tried to plead her cause; but\nhe stamped on the floor, and bade her be silent.Was he drunk, then\nit was her fault; was he wicked, that was her fault, too; had he\nbecome a <DW36> and an unlucky man for all his life, then, again,\nshe and that cursed boy of hers were the cause of it.Margit answered, \"was it I that ran after\nyou?\"\"Yes, that you did,\" he cried, raising himself; and, still\nblubbering, he continued, \"Now, at last, it has turned out just as\nyou would have it: I drag along here day after day--every day looking\non my own grave.But I might have lived in splendor with the first\ngirl in the parish; I might have travelled as far as the sun; if you\nand that cursed boy of yours hadn't put yourselves in my way.\"Again she tried to defend herself: \"It isn't the boy's fault, at any\nrate.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.\"Hold your tongue, or I'll strike you!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.The next day, when he had slept himself sober, he felt ashamed, and\nwould especially be kind to the boy.But he was soon drunk again; and\nthen he beat Margit.At last he beat her almost every time he was\ndrunk; Arne then cried and fretted, and so he beat him, too; but\noften he was so miserable afterwards that he felt obliged to go out\nagain and take some more spirits.At this time, too, he began once\nmore to set his mind on going to dancing-parties.He played at them\njust as he used to do before his illness; and he took Arne with him\nto carry the fiddle-case.At these parties the child saw and heard\nmuch which was not good for him; and the mother often wept because he\nwas taken there: still she dared not say anything to the father about\nit.But to the child she often imploringly said, with many caresses,\n\"Keep close to God, and don't learn anything wicked.\"But at the\ndancing-parties there was very much to amuse him, while at home with\nthe mother there was very little; and so he turned more and more away\nfrom her to the father: she saw it, but was silent.He learned many\nsongs at these parties, and he used to sing them to the father, who\nfelt amused, and laughed now and then at them.This flattered the boy\nso much that he set himself to learn as many songs as he could; and\nsoon he found out what it was that the father liked, and that made\nhim laugh.When there was nothing of this kind in the songs, the boy\nwould himself put something in as well as he could; and thus he early\nacquired facility in setting words to music.But lampoons and\ndisgusting stories about people who had risen to wealth and\ninfluence, were the things which the father liked best, and which the\nboy sang.The mother always wished him to go with her in the cow-house to tend\nthe cattle in the evening.He used to find all sorts of excuses to\navoid going; but it was of no use; she was resolved he should go.There she talked to him about God and good things, and generally\nended by pressing him to her heart, imploring him, with many tears,\nnot to become a bad man.She helped him, too, in his reading-lessons.He was extremely\nquick in learning; and the father felt proud of him, and told\nhim--especially when he was drunk--that he had _his_ cleverness.At dancing-parties, when the father was drunk, he used often to ask\nArne to sing to the people; and then he would sing song after song,\namidst their loud laughter and applause.This pleased him even more\nthan it pleased his father; and at last he used to sing songs without\nnumber.Some anxious mothers who heard this, came to Margit and told\nher about it, because the subjects of the songs were not such as they\nought to have been.Then she called the boy to her side, and forbade\nhim, in the name of God and all that was good, to sing such songs any\nmore.And now it seemed to him that she was always opposed to what\ngave him pleasure; and, for the first time in his life, he told the\nfather what she had said; and when he was again drunk she had to\nsuffer for it severely: till then he had not spoken of it.Then Arne\nsaw clearly how wrong a thing he had done, and in the depths of his\nsoul he asked God and her to forgive him; but he could not ask it in\nwords.She continued to show him the same kindness as before, and it\npierced his heart.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.Once, however, in spite of all, he again wronged\nher.He had a talent for mimicking people, especially in their\nspeaking and singing; and one evening, while he was amusing the\nfather in this way, the mother entered, and, when she was going away,\nthe father took it into his head to ask him to mimic her.At first he\nrefused; but the father, who lay on the bed laughing till he shook,\ninsisted upon his doing it.\"She's gone,\" the boy thought, \"and can't\nhear me;\" and he mimicked her singing, just as it was when her voice\nwas hoarse and obstructed by tears.The father laughed till the boy\ngrew quite frightened and at once left off.Then the mother came in\nfrom the kitchen, looked at Arne long and mournfully, went over to\nthe shelf, took down a milk-dish and carried it away.He felt burning hot all over: she had heard it all.He jumped down\nfrom the table where he had been sitting, went out, threw himself on\nthe ground, and wished to hide himself for ever in the earth.He\ncould not rest, and he rose and went farther from the house.Passing\nby the barn, he there saw his mother sitting, making a new fine shirt\nfor him.It was her usual habit to sing a hymn while sewing: now,\nhowever, she was silent.Then Arne could bear it no longer; he threw\nhimself on the grass at her feet, looked up in her face, and wept and\nsobbed bitterly.Margit let fall her work, and took his head between\nher hands.she said, putting her face down to his.He did not try\nto say a word, but wept as he had never wept before.\"I knew you were\ngood at heart,\" she said, stroking his head.\"Mother, you mustn't refuse what I am now going to ask,\" were the\nfirst words he was able to utter.\"You know I never do refuse you,\" answered she.He tried to stop his tears, and then, with his face still in her\nlap, he stammered out, \"Do sing a little for me, mother.\"\"You know I can't do it,\" she said, in a low voice.\"Sing something for me, mother,\" implored the boy; \"or I shall never\nhave courage to look you in the face again.\"She went on stroking his\nhair, but was silent.\"Do sing, mother dear,\" he implored again; \"or\nI shall go far away, and never come back any more.\"Though he was now\nalmost fifteen years old, he lay there with his head in his mother's\nlap, and she began to sing:\n\n   \"Merciful Father, take in thy care\n      The child as he plays by the shore;\n    Send him Thy Holy Spirit there,\n      And leave him alone no more.Slipp'ry's the way, and high is the tide;\n    Still if Thou keepest close by his side\n    He never will drown, but live for Thee,\n    And then at the last Thy heaven will see.Wondering where her child is astray,\n      The mother stands at the cottage door,\n    Calls him a hundred times i' the day,\n      And fears he will come no more.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.But then she thinks, whatever betide,\n    The Spirit of God will be his Guide,\n    And Christ the blessed, his little Brother,\n    Will carry him back to his longing mother.\"Arne lay still; a blessed peace came over\nhim, and under its soothing influence he slept.The last word he\nheard distinctly was, \"Christ;\" it transported him into regions of\nlight; and he fancied that he listened to a chorus of voices, but his\nmother's voice was clearer than all.Sweeter tones he had never\nheard, and he prayed to be allowed to sing in like manner; and then\nat once he began, gently and softly, and still more softly, until\nhis bliss became rapture, and then suddenly all disappeared.He\nawoke, looked about him, listened attentively, but heard nothing save\nthe little rivulet which flowed past the barn with a low and constant\nmurmur.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.The mother was gone; but she had placed the half-made shirt\nand his jacket under his head.When now the time of year came for the cattle to be sent into the\nwood, Arne wished to go to tend them.But the father opposed him:\nindeed, he had never gone before, though he was now in his fifteenth\nyear.But he pleaded so well, that his wish was at last complied\nwith; and so during the spring, summer, and autumn, he passed the\nwhole day alone in the wood, and only came home to sleep.He took his books up there, and read, carved letters in the bark of\nthe trees, thought, longed, and sang.But when in the evening he came\nhome and found the father often drunk and beating the mother, cursing\nher and the whole parish, and saying how once he might have gone far\naway, then a longing for travelling arose in the lad's mind.There\nwas no comfort for him at home", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Then, about midsummer, he met with Christian, the Captain's eldest\nson, who one day came to the wood with the servant boy, to catch the\nhorses, and to ride them home.He was a few years older than Arne,\nlight-hearted and jolly, restless in mind, but nevertheless strong in\npurpose; he spoke fast and abruptly, and generally about two things\nat once; shot birds in their flight; rode bare-backed horses;\nwent fly-fishing; and altogether seemed to Arne the paragon of\nperfection.He, too, had set his mind upon travelling, and he talked\nto Arne about foreign countries till they shone like fairy-lands.He\nfound out Arne's love for reading, and he carried up to him all the\nbooks he had read himself; on Sundays he taught him geography from\nmaps: and during the whole of that summer Arne read till he became\npale and thin.Even when the winter came, he was permitted to read at home; partly\nbecause he was going to be confirmed the next year, and partly\nbecause he always knew how to manage with his father.He also began\nto go to school; but while there it seemed to him he never got on so\nwell as when he shut his eyes and thought over the things in his\nbooks at home: and he no longer had any companions among the boys of\nthe parish.The father's bodily infirmity, as well as his passion for drinking,\nincreased with his years; and he treated his wife worse and worse.And while Arne sat at home trying to amuse him, and often, merely to\nkeep peace for the mother, telling things which he now despised, a\nhatred of his father grew up in his heart.But there he kept it\nsecretly, just as he kept his love for his mother.Even when he\nhappened to meet Christian, he said nothing to him about home\naffairs; but all their talk ran upon their books and their intended\ntravels.But often when, after those wide roaming conversations, he\nwas returning home alone, thinking of what he perhaps would have to\nsee when he arrived there, he wept and prayed that God would take\ncare he might soon be allowed to go away.In the summer he and Christian were confirmed: and soon afterwards\nthe latter carried out his purpose of travelling.At last, he\nprevailed upon his father to let him be a sailor; and he went far\naway; first giving Arne his books, and promising to write often to\nhim.About this time a wish to make songs awoke again in his mind; and now\nhe no longer patched old songs, but made new ones for himself, and\nsaid in them whatever most pained him.But soon his heart became too heavy to let him make songs any more.He lay sleepless whole nights, feeling that he could not bear to stay\nat home any longer, and that he must go far away, find out Christian,\nand--not say a word about it to any one.But when he thought of the\nmother, and what would become of her, he could scarcely look her in\nthe face; and his love made him linger still.One evening when it was growing late, Arne sat reading: indeed, when\nhe felt more sad than usual he always took refuge in his books;\nlittle understanding that they only increased his burden.The father\nhad gone to a wedding party, but was expected home that evening; the\nmother, weary and afraid of him, had gone to bed.Then Arne was\nstartled by the sound of a heavy fall in the passage, and of\nsomething hard pushing against the door.It was the father, just\ncoming home.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.he muttered; \"come and help your father\nto get up.\"Arne helped him up, and brought him to the bench; then\ncarried in the violin-case after him, and shut the door.\"Well, look\nat me, you clever boy; I don't look very handsome now; Nils, the\ntailor's no longer the man he used to be.One thing I--tell--you--you\nshall never drink spirits; they're--the devil, the world, and the\nflesh.... 'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.'He sat silent for a while, and then sang in a tearful voice,\n\n   \"Merciful Lord, I come to Thee;\n    Help, if there can be help for me;\n    Though by the mire of sin defiled,\n    I'm still Thine own dear ransomed child.\"\"'Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof; but\nspeak the word only....'\" He threw himself forward, hid his face in\nhis hands, and sobbed violently.Then, after lying thus a long while,\nhe said, word for word out of the Scriptures, just as he had learned\nit more than twenty years ago, \"'But he answered and said, I am not\nsent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.Then came she\nand worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.But he answered and said,\nIt is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall\nfrom their master's table.'\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Then he was silent, and his weeping became subdued and calm.The mother had been long awake, without looking up; but now when she\nheard him weeping thus like one who is saved, she raised herself on\nher elbows, and gazed earnestly at him.But scarcely did Nils perceive her before he called out, \"Are you\nlooking up, you ugly vixen!I suppose you would like to see what a\nstate you have brought me to.... He rose;\nand she hid herself under the fur coverlet.\"Nay, don't hide, I'm\nsure to find you,\" he said, stretching out his right hand and\nfumbling with his forefinger on the bed-clothes, \"Tickle, tickle,\" he\nsaid, turning aside the fur coverlet, and putting his forefinger on\nher throat.\"How shrivelled and thin you've become already, there's no depth of\nflesh here!\"She writhed beneath his touch, and seized his hand with\nboth hers, but could not free herself.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.How she wriggles, the ugly thing!Can't\nyou scream to make believe I am beating you?I only\nwant to take away your breath.\"Arne said once more, running to the corner of the room, and\nsnatching up an axe which stood there.\"Is it only out of perverseness, you don't scream?you had better\nbeware; for I've taken such a strange fancy into my head.Now I think I shall soon get rid of that screaming of yours.\"Arne shouted, rushing towards him with the axe uplifted.But before Arne could reach him, he started up with a piercing cry,\nlaid his hand upon his heart, and fell heavily down.Arne stood as if rooted in the ground, and gradually lowered the axe.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.He grew dizzy and bewildered, and scarcely knew where he was.Then\nthe mother began to move to and fro in the bed, and to breathe\nheavily, as if oppressed by some great weight lying upon her.Arne\nsaw that she needed help; but yet he felt unable to render it.At\nlast she raised herself a little, and saw the father lying stretched\non the floor, and Arne standing beside him with the axe.\"Merciful Lord, what have you done?\"she cried, springing out of the\nbed, putting on her skirt and coming nearer.\"He fell down himself,\" said Arne, at last regaining power to speak.\"Arne, Arne, I don't believe you,\" said the mother in a stern\nreproachful voice: \"now Jesus help you!\"And she threw herself upon\nthe dead man with loud wailing.But the boy awoke from his stupor, dropped the axe and fell down on\nhis knees: \"As true as I hope for mercy from God, I've not done it.I\nalmost thought of doing it; I was so bewildered; but then he fell\ndown himself; and here I've been standing ever since.\"The mother looked at him, and believed him.\"Then our Lord has been\nhere Himself,\" she said quietly, sitting down on the floor and gazing\nbefore her.Nils lay quite stiff, with open eyes and mouth, and hands drawn near\ntogether, as though he had at the last moment tried to fold them, but\nhad been unable to do so.The first thing the mother now did was to\nfold them.\"Let us look closer at him,\" she said then, going over to\nthe fireplace, where the fire was almost out.Arne followed her, for\nhe felt afraid of standing alone.She gave him a lighted fir-splinter\nto hold; then she once more went over to the dead body and stood by\none side of it, while the son stood at the other, letting the light\nfall upon it.\"Yes, he's quite gone,\" she said; and then, after a little while, she\ncontinued, \"and gone in an evil hour, I'm afraid.\"Arne's hands trembled so much that the burning ashes of the splinter\nfell upon the father's clothes and set them on fire; but the boy did\nnot perceive it, neither did the mother at first, for she was\nweeping.But soon she became aware of it through the bad smell, and\nshe cried out in fear.When now the boy looked, it seemed to him as\nthough the father himself was burning, and he dropped the splinter\nupon him, sinking down in a swoon.Up and down, and round and round,\nthe room moved with him; the table moved, the bed moved; the axe\nhewed; the father rose and came to him; and then all of them came\nrolling upon him.Then he felt as if a soft cooling breeze passed\nover his face; and he cried out and awoke.The first thing he did was\nto look at the father, to assure himself that he still lay quietly.And a feeling of inexpressible happiness came over the boy's mind\nwhen he saw that the father was dead--really dead; and he rose as\nthough he were entering upon a new life.The mother had extinguished the burning clothes, and began to lay out\nthe body.She made the bed, and then said to Arne, \"Take hold of your\nfather, you're so strong, and help me to lay him nicely.\"They laid\nhim on the bed, and Margit shut his eyes and mouth, stretched his\nlimbs, and folded his hands once more.It was only a little past\nmidnight, and they had to stay there with him till morning.She had been a diligent\nstudent of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal\nfrom her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation\nwould work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else.\"Oh, well,\" she thought finally, \"he is not going to leave me right\naway--that is something.She sighed\nas she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her\nLester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nThere was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie\nwent the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the\nreunion between mother and child made up for many other worries.\"Now\nI can do by her as I ought,\" she thought; and three or four times\nduring the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make\nhimself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his\nlife--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had\nsuggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this\napartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way\nthrough a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to\nthe apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a\nplace of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for\nJennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost\nuncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,\ncommercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first\nnight Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a\nvery bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't\ngo near him.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the\nfull significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array\nVesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give\nher own toilet a last touch.As a\nmatter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the\nsitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his\nhat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child\nlooked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed\nin a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and\ncuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her\ncorn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,\nrosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to\nsay something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had\narrived.\"Do you have much\ntrouble in making her mind?\"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of\ntheir conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't\ntalk?\"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,\npeevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been\nless tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a\ndisagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,\ncombined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the\nbackground, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and\nyouth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had\nbeen the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated\nfrom it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its\nexistence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when\nhe thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to\nsee a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring\ndoor--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the\nordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have\nbeen immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate\nboldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with\nthe saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially\nresponsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude\nof aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by\nthe mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a\ndesire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by\nhis paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The\nyoung wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon\nhim.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,\ncalmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused\nby another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had\ngiven Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until\nLester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring\nout the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in\nmanner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie\ncolored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a\nlittle broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her\nface.\"I want my little broom,\" she exclaimed and marched sedately past,\nat which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,\nthis time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across\nhis mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down\nthe feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in\nits place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a\nhuman being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further\nrelax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in\nwhich he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "It was too much like a bed of\ndown.The condition of unquestioned\nliberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,\ncoupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the\nhome was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps\nit would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta\ninsensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of\nhumor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie\nwatched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,\nnevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and\ncame straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing\naway at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,\nwhen Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a\nlittle breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,\nreached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained\na desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the\nlumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, \"I want two\nlumps in mine, mamma.\"\"No, dearest,\" replied Jennie, \"you don't need any in yours.\"Uncle Lester has two,\" she protested.\"Yes,\" returned Jennie; \"but you're only a little girl.Besides you\nmustn't say anything like that at the table.\"Uncle Lester eats too much sugar,\" was her immediate rejoinder, at\nwhich that fine gourmet smiled broadly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.\"I don't know about that,\" he put in, for the first time deigning\nto answer her directly.\"That sounds like the fox and grapes to me.\"Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she\nchattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last\nLester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he\nwas willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his\nposition and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,\nthat he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement\nwhich would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which\nwas back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,\nand Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had\nbeen transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the\nclub.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in\nChicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of\ndetails were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable\noffice force, and the handling of various important transactions.It\ntook away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's\nhusband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best\nto push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was\nbringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of\nthe factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in\ndanger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane\nsenior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take\ncharge.Apparently he and Robert were on\nbetter terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact\nthat Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be\npermanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by\npeople who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for\nbrazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at\nliberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any\nyoung woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not\npropose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always\nmade it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others\nmight not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has\nbeen said, she was simply \"Miss Gerhardt.\"The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers\nof life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he\nhad been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came\nto Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do\nthis sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when\nthere would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester\nand Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened\nthat, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was\nseized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he\nthought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,\nand tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of\nquinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning\nhe was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting\nheadache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel\nand endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad\nto be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that\nhe was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he\nyielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or\nwell.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She\nbrought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in\ncold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him\nappetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps\noccurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on\nher way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally\nplanned.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in\nChicago.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and\nwould not be down for several days, she asked where he could be\nreached.\"I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific,\" said an\nincautious secretary.Louise, a little\ndisturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Kane\nhad not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of\nfact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by\nthis, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had\ncalled up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had\nnot been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,\nit had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that\nshe was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,\n\"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.\"\"Whose address is that you're giving?\"The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was\ngone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her\nbrother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the\nsteps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of\nKane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she\nwas opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably\nattired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe,\" began Louise,\ncondescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She\nwas a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were\nas yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried\nto make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and\nstation, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise\nlooked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,\nwhich gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to\nbe playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the\nnew-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,\na window to the left of him, his eyes closed.Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized\nin an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but\nwords failed him.\"Why, hello, Louise,\" he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought,\" she answered lamely,\na sense of something wrong irritating her.\"I had a hard time finding\nyou, too.Who's your--\" she was about to say \"pretty\nhousekeeper,\" but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain\narticles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the\nhome atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a\ndress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which\ncaused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,\nwho had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed\nslightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant.\"You shouldn't have come out here,\" said Lester finally, before\nLouise could give vent to the rising question in her mind.she exclaimed, angered at the brazen confession.Why should you have any place that I\ncouldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.\"\"Listen, Louise,\" went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one\nelbow.\"You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our\ngetting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would\nhave made other arrangements.\"\"Other arrangements, indeed,\" she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this\ntrap; it was really disgraceful of Lester.\"I wouldn't be so haughty about it,\" he declared, his color rising.\"I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have\nmade other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging\nyour pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.\"\"I thought\nbetter of you, honestly I did.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.I should think you would be ashamed of\nyourself living here in open--\" she paused without using the\nword--\"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and\nconsideration.\"\"I tell you I'm not apologizing to\nyou.If you don't like this you know what you can do.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.she demanded, savagely and yet\ncuriously.If it were it wouldn't make any\ndifference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs.\"Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the\nsitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more,\" retorted Louise.\"I\nshould think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything\nlike this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I\nthought she was--\" she was again going to add \"your housekeeper,\"\nbut she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of\nbrutality.\"Never mind what you thought she was,\" he growled.\"She's better\nthan some who do the so-called superior thinking.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I\ndon't care what you think.\"Well, I won't, I assure you,\" she flung back.\"It's quite plain\nthat your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of\ndecency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into\ncoming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will\nthe others be when they hear of it.\"She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look\nbeing reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door\nof the dining-room.Jennie came in a little\nwhile later and closed the door.Lester,\nhis thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily\non his pillow.\"What a devilish trick of fortune,\" he thought.Now she\nwould go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and\nhis mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no\nexplanation to make--she had seen.He stared at the wall\nmeditatively.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for\nreflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now\nshe could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from\nher as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his\nfather and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him\nsocially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the\nstreets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes\nof the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought\ntore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low\nand vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,\nbasically so in Lester's eyes.She went\nabout numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it\nall.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the\nworld, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be\nbrought about?CHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nOutraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to\nCincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished\nwith many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a\n\"silly-looking, white-faced woman,\" who did not even offer to invite\nher in when she announced her name, but stood there \"looking just as\nguilty as a person possibly could.\"Lester also had acted shamefully,\nhaving outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to\nknow whose the child was he had refused to tell her.\"It isn't mine,\"\nwas all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear\nthe story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the\nwords needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality.\"I went there solely because I thought I could help him,\" continued\nLouise.\"I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be\nseriously ill.\"To think he would come to\nanything like that!\"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having\nno previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old\nArchibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the\ndiscussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with\na woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant\nand indifferent as his nature was strong.Lester was a centralized authority in\nhimself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,\nthey would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but\ndetermined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation\nwith Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from\ntime to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested\nthat Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester.\"He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him\nirreparable damage,\" said Mr.\"He cannot hope to carry it off\nsuccessfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.I\nwant you to tell him that for me.\"\"All well and good,\" said Robert, \"but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.\"\"I hope to,\" said old Archibald, \"eventually; but you'd better go\nup and try, anyhow.You see\nhow much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve\nyour feelings", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "\"Yes, yes,\" said his father distractedly, \"better go.\"Without allowing himself to anticipate any\nparticular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly\ninto Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of\nmorality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,\nhe called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then\ntelephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was\nstill indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he\ndid.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they\ntalked business for a time.\"Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here,\" began Robert\ntentatively.\"I think I could make a guess at it,\" Lester replied.\"They were all very much worried over the fact that you were\nsick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a\nrelapse, are you?\"\"Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage\nshe ran into up here.\"The young woman Louise saw is just--\" Robert waved his hand\nexpressively.\"I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother\nwas so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for\nher sake\"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and\nrespect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some\nexplanation due.\"I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much,\" he\nreplied thoughtfully.I have the\nwoman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about\nthe thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out.\"He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly\nreasoning in his mind.He seemed, as\nusual, to be most convincingly sane.\"You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?\"\"I hadn't come to that,\" answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert\nturned his glance to the distant scene of the city.\"It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I\nsuppose,\" ventured Robert.\"I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus\nwith you or not,\" returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor.All I know is that the lady is\nvery pleasing to me.\"\"Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,\nLester,\" went on Robert, after another pause.\"Morality doesn't seem\nto figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that\ntogether.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be\nsubstantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and\npride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets\nmore store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as\nwell as I do, of course.\"\"I know how father feels about it,\" returned Lester.\"The whole\nbusiness is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I\ndon't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always\nof a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm\nnot willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs\nthan appears on the court calendar.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,\"\nreturned Robert, \"and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a\nbit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend\nto marry her?\"This last was put forth as a feeler.\"I might be willing to agree to that, too,\" was Lester's baffling\nreply, \"if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman\nis here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is\nanything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can\nact for me in this matter.\"Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,\ncoming back after a time to say: \"You say you haven't any idea of\nmarrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,\nfrom every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your\nposition has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from\nfamily considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply\nthrowing your life away--\"\n\nHe paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was\ncustomary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor\nand simplicity of this appeal.He\nwas making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began\non a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester\nand the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some\nwell-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at\nleast worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely\nLester must realize that.\"I know just how all of them feel about it,\" Lester interrupted at\nlast, \"but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.\"You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give\nher up just at present?\"\"I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm\nmorally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may\nbe, I can't tell.\"\"Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been\naccustomed to live with me,\" replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal\nfutile.\"Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable\narrangements with her and let her go?\"\"Not without due consideration of the matter; no.\"\"You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will\nend quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for\nsoftening down the pain of it to the family?\"\"I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away\nthe edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and\nI can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said\nbefore, these relationships are involved with things which make it\nimpossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No\none can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in\nthem, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up\nhere and give you my word to do anything except the best I can.\"Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only\nto come back after a time and say, \"You don't think there's anything\nto be done just at present?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\"Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know\nthat there's anything else we can talk about.\"\"Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to\nget down to the hotel if you'll stay.\"\"I believe I can make that one\no'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,\nRobert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the\ndifference time had already made.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Robert was the clean, decisive man,\nLester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and\nintegrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,\nlooking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking\npicture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were\nnow running through their minds.\"Well,\" said the older brother, after a time, \"I don't suppose\nthere is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as\nwe do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of\nthis.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It\nstrikes me as a very bad move on your part though.\"He said nothing, but his face expressed an\nunchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door\ntogether.\"I'll put the best face I can on it,\" said Robert, and walked\nout.CHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nIn this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be\nlimited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to\nthe creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about\nthe sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the\nseas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of\nthe fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the\nflowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the\ncircumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in\nwhich life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note\nthe ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on\ntheir part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of\nlimitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws\ngoverning our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit\nof a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments\nof society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being\nintangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the\nsphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the\nbird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the\nhaunts of man.People may do\nno more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh\nsarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined\nis the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is\ndoomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is\npractically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed\nto a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably\nat either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother\nhad gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder\nwas spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,\nhope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a\nwind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his\nprospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in\nthe paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie\nbe necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his\nown home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going\nrelationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection\nwould be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used\nto dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part\nof his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of\nLouise.\"It's unfortunate,\" was all that he thought to himself, and\ntherewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the\nconsideration of what, if anything, was to be done.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.\"I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or\nThursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough,\" he said to Jennie after he\nhad returned.\"I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his\nbag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a\nsullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all\nover, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of\nmaking a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the\nother, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any\nother member of the family was at all likely to seek another\nconference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as\nusual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;\ncertainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.But the\nconsciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed\nupon him.\"Bad business,\" he meditated--\"bad business.\"For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs\ncontinued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important\nbusiness conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it\noff quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed\nhim affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his\ncustomary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,\nconcertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore\nthe one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it\npersisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far\nbetween as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nIn the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her\nown.But in order to make\nassurance doubly sure, I sent one of my men to the continent.He\nreported that her Ladyship had for some months been a patient at\nCharleroi, but had recently escaped from there, and that you are still\nemploying detectives to find her.\"\"I did not engage you to pry into my affairs,\" exclaimed Cyril savagely.\"Nor have I exceeded my duty as I conceive it,\" retorted the detective.\"As your Lordship refused to honour me with your confidence, I had to\nfind out the facts by other means; and you must surely realise that\nwithout facts it is impossible for me to construct a theory, and till I\ncan do that my work is practically valueless.\"\"But my wife has nothing to do with the case.\"\"Quite so, my lord, but a lady who claimed to be her Ladyship is\nintimately concerned with it.\"\"If your Lordship will listen to me, I think I can prove to you that as\nfar as the lady's identity is concerned, I have made no mistake.But to\ndo this convincingly, I must reconstruct the tragedy as I conceive that\nit happened.\"\"Go ahead; I don't mind hearing your theory.\"\"First, I must ask you to take it for granted that I am right in\nbelieving that Prentice was ignorant of her Ladyship's flight.\"Now let us try and imagine exactly what was her\nLadyship's position on the night of the murder.Her first care must have\nbeen to devise some means of eluding his Lordship's vigilance.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.This was\na difficult problem, for Mustapha tells me that his Lordship was not\nonly a very light sleeper but that he suffered from chronic insomnia.You may or may not know that his Lordship had long been addicted to the\nopium habit and would sometimes for days together lie in a stupor.Large\nquantities of the drug were found in his room and that explains how her\nLadyship managed to get hold of the opium with which she doctored his\nLordship's coffee.\"\"This is, however, mere supposition on your part,\" objected Cyril.I had the sediment of the two cups analysed and\nthe chemist found that one of them contained a small quantity of opium.Her Ladyship, being practically ignorant as to the exact nature of the\ndrug and of the effect it would have on a man who was saturated with it,\ngave his Lordship too small a dose.Nevertheless, he became immediately\nstupefied.\"\"Now, how on earth can you know that?\"If his Lordship had not been rendered at once\nunconscious, he would--knowing that an attempt had been made to drug\nhim--have sounded the alarm and deputed Mustapha to guard her Ladyship,\nwhich was what he always did when he knew that he was not equal to the\ntask.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.\"Well, that sounds plausible, at all events,\" acknowledged Cyril.\"As soon as her Ladyship knew that she was no longer watched,\" continued\nthe detective, \"she at once set to work to disguise herself.As we know,\nshe had provided herself with clothes, but I fancy her hair, her most\nnoticeable feature, must have caused her some anxious moments.\"\"She may have worn a wig,\" suggested Cyril, hoping that Judson would\naccept this explanation of the difficulty, in which case he would be\nable triumphantly to demolish the latter's theory of the girl's\nidentity, by", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "After carefully investigating the matter I have come to\nthe conclusion that she did not.And my reasons are, first, that no\nhairdresser in Newhaven has lately sold a dark wig to any one, and,\nsecondly, that no parcel arrived, addressed either to her Ladyship or to\nPrentice, which could have contained such an article.On the other hand,\nas his Lordship had for years dyed his hair and beard, her Ladyship had\nonly to go into his dressing-room to procure a very simple means of\ntransforming herself.\"\"But doesn't it take ages to dye hair?\"\"If it is done properly, yes; but the sort of stain his Lordship used\ncan be very quickly applied.I do not believe it took her Ladyship more\nthan half an hour to dye enough of her hair to escape notice, but in all\nprobability she had no time to do it very thoroughly and that which\nescaped may have turned white.This was a possibility which had not occurred to Cyril; but still he\nrefused to be convinced.Let me continue my story: Before her Ladyship had\ncompleted her preparations, his Lordship awoke from his stupor.\"\"Because, if his Lordship had not tried to prevent her escape, she would\nhave had no reason for killing him.Probably they had a struggle, her\nhand fell on the pistol, and the deed was done----\"\n\n\"But what about the ruined picture?\"\"Her Ladyship, knowing that there was no other portrait of her in\nexistence, destroyed it in order to make it difficult for the police to\nfollow her.\"\"You make her Ladyship out a nice, cold-blooded,\ncalculating sort of person.If you think she at all resembles the young\nlady at the nursing home, I can only tell you that you are vastly\nmistaken.\"\"As I have not the honour of knowing the lady in question, I cannot form\nany opinion as to that.But let us continue: I wish to confess at once\nthat I am not at all sure how her Ladyship reached Newhaven.On the face of it, it seems as\nif it must have some connection with the case.I have also a feeling\nthat it has, and yet for the life of me I cannot discover the connecting\nlink.Whatever the younger man was, the elder was undoubtedly a\nFrenchman, and I have ascertained that with the exception of an old\nFrench governess, who lived with her Ladyship before her marriage, and\nof Mustapha and Valdriguez, Lady Wilmersley knew no foreigner whatever.Besides, these two men seem to have been motoring about the country\nalmost at random, and it may have been the merest accident which brought\nthem to the foot of the long lane just at the time when her Ladyship was\nin all probability leaving the castle.Whether they gave her a lift as\nfar as Newhaven, I do not know.How her Ladyship reached the town\nconstitutes the only serious--I will not call it break--but hiatus--in\nmy theory.From half-past six the next morning, however, her movements\ncan be easily followed.A young lady, dressed as you know, approached\nthe station with obvious nervousness.Three things attracted the\nattention of the officials: first, the discrepancy between the\nsimplicity, I might almost say the poverty, of her clothes, and the fact\nthat she purchased a first-class ticket; secondly, that she did not wish\nher features to be seen; and thirdly, that she had no luggage except a\nsmall hand-bag.How her Ladyship managed to elude the police, and what\nhas subsequently occurred to her, I do not need to tell your Lordship.\"\"You haven't in the least convinced me that the young lady is her\nLadyship, not in the least.You yourself admit that there is a hiatus in\nyour story; well, that hiatus is to me a gulf which you have failed to\nbridge.Because one lady disappears from Geralton and another appears\nthe next morning in Newhaven, you insist the two are identical.But you\nhave not offered me one iota of proof that such is the case.\"She is the only person who left Newhaven\nby train or boat who even vaguely resembled her Ladyship.\"Her Ladyship may not have come to Newhaven at all,\nbut have been driven to some hiding-place in the Frenchman's car.\"\"I think that quite impossible, for every house, every cottage, every\nstable and barn even, for twenty-five miles around, has been carefully\nsearched.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Besides, this would mean that the murder had been premeditated\nand the coming of the motor had been pre-arranged; and lastly, as the\ngardener's wife testifies that the car left Geralton certainly no\nearlier than eleven-thirty, and as the two men reached the hotel before\ntwelve, this precludes the possibility that they could have done more\nthan drive straight back to the Inn, as the motor is by no means a fast\none.\"\"But, my man, they may have secreted her Ladyship in the town itself and\nhave taken her with them to France the next morning.\"In the first place, they left alone, the porter saw them\noff; and secondly, no one except the two Frenchmen purchased a ticket\nfor the continent either in the Newhaven office or on the boat.\"Judson's logic was horribly convincing; no\nsmallest detail had apparently escaped him.As the man piled argument on\nargument, he had found himself slowly and grudgingly accepting his\nconclusions.\"As you are in my employ, I take it for granted that you will not inform\nthe police or the press of your--suspicions,\" he said at last.On the other hand, I must ask you to allow me\nto withdraw from the case.\"\"Because my duty to you, as my client, prevents me from taking any\nfurther steps in this matter.\"\"I gather that you are less anxious to clear up the mystery than to\nprotect her Ladyship.\"You would even wish me to assist you in providing a safe retreat for\nher.\"\"Well, my lord, that is just what I cannot do.It is my duty, as I\nconceive it, to hold my tongue, but I should not feel justified in\naiding her Ladyship to escape the consequences of her--her--action.In\norder to be faithful to my engagement to you, I am willing to let the\npublic believe that I have made a failure of the case.I shall not even\nallow my imagination to dwell on your future movements, but more than\nthat I cannot do.\"\"You take the position that her Ladyship is an ordinary criminal, but\nyou must realise that that is absurd.Even granting that she is\nresponsible for her husband's death--of which, by the way, we have no\nabsolute proof--are you not able to make allowances for a poor woman\ngoaded to desperation by an opium fiend?\"\"I do not constitute myself her Ladyship's judge, but I don't think your\nLordship quite realises all that you are asking of me.Even if I were\nwilling to waive the question of my professional honour, I should still\ndecline to undertake a task which, I know, is foredoomed to failure.For, if _I_ discovered Lady Wilmersley with so little difficulty,\nScotland Yard is bound to do so before long.The trail is too\nunmistakable.It is impossible--absolutely impossible, I assure you,\nthat the secret can be kept.\"\"I wish I could convince your Lordship of this and induce you to allow\nthe law to take its course.Her Ladyship ought to come forward at once\nand plead justifiable homicide.If she waits till she is arrested, it\nwill tell heavily against her.\"\"But she is ill, really ill,\" insisted Cyril.Stuart-Smith tells me\nthat if she is not kept perfectly quiet for the next few weeks, her\nnervous system may never recover from the shock.\"That certainly complicates the situation; on the other hand, you\nmust remember that discovery is not only inevitable but imminent, and\nthat the police will not stop to consider her Ladyship's nervous system.No, my lord, the only thing for you to do is to break the news to her\nyourself and to persuade her to give herself up.If you don't, you will\nboth live to regret it.\"\"That may be so,\" replied Cyril after a minute's hesitation, \"but in\nthis matter I must judge for myself.I still hope that you are wrong and\nthat either the young woman in question is not Lady Wilmersley or that\nit was not her Ladyship who killed my cousin, and I refuse to jeopardise\nher life till I am sure that there is no possibility of your having made\na mistake.So far you have only sought\nfor evidence which would strengthen your theory of her Ladyship's guilt,\nnow I want you to look at the case from a fresh point of view.I want\nyou to start all over again and to work on the assumption that her\nLadyship did not fire the shot.I cannot accept your conclusion as final\ntill we have exhausted every other possibility.These Frenchmen, for\ninstance, have they or have they not a connection with the case?And\nthen there is Valdriguez.At the\ninquest she acknowledged that no one had seen her leave her Ladyship's\napartments and we have only her word for it that she spent the evening\nin her room.\"But, if I went on the principle of suspecting every one who\ncannot prove themselves innocent, I should soon be lost in a quagmire of\nbarren conjectures.Of course, I have considered Valdriguez, but I can\nfind no reason for suspecting her.\"\"Well, I could give you a dozen reasons.\"\"Indeed, my lord, and what are they?\"\"In the first place, we know that she is a hard, unprincipled woman, or\nshe would never have consented to aid my cousin in depriving his\nunfortunate wife of her liberty.A woman who would do that, is capable\nof any villainy.Then, on the witness-stand didn't you feel that she was\nholding something back?Oh, I forgot you were not present at the\ninquest.\"\"I was there, my lord, but I took good care that no one should recognise\nme.\"\"Well, and what impression did she make on you?\"I think she spoke the truth and I\nfancy that she is almost a religious fanatic.\"\"You don't mean to say, Judson, that you allowed yourself to be taken in\nby her sanctimonious airs and the theatrical way that she kept clutching\nat that cross on her breast?Why, don't you\nsee that no woman with a spark of religion in her could have allowed her\nmistress to be treated as Lady Wilmersley was?\"\"Quite so, my lord, and it is because Valdriguez impressed me as an\nhonest old creature that I am still doubtful whether her Ladyship is\ninsane or not, and this uncertainty hampers me very much in my work.\"\"Lady Upton assured me that her granddaughter's mind had never been\nunbalanced and that his Lordship, although he frequently wrote to her,\nhad never so much as hinted at such a thing; and if you believe the\nyoung lady at the nursing home to be Lady Wilmersley, I give you my word\nthat she shows no sign of mental derangement.\"\"Well, that seems pretty final, and yet--and yet--I cannot believe that\nValdriguez is a vicious woman.A man in my profession acquires a curious\ninstinct in such matters, my lord.\"The detective paused a moment and\nwhen he began again, he spoke almost as if he were reasoning with\nhimself.\"Now, if my estimate of Valdriguez is correct, and if it is\nalso a fact that Lady Wilmersley has never been insane, there are\ncertainly possibilities connected with this affair which I have by no\nmeans exhausted--and so, my lord, I am not only willing but anxious to\ncontinue on the case, if you will agree to allow me to ignore her\nLadyship's existence.\"But tell me, Judson, how can you hope to reconcile two such\nabsolutely contradictory facts?\"\"Two such apparently contradictory facts,\" gently corrected the\ndetective.\"Well, my lord, I propose to find out more of this woman's\nantecedents.I have several times tried to get her to talk, but so far\nwithout the least success.She says that she will answer any question\nput to her on the witness-stand, but that it is against her principles\nto gossip about her late master and mistress.She is equally reticent as\nto her past life and when I told her that her silence seemed to me very\nsuspicious, she demanded--suspicious of what?She went on to say that\nshe could not see that it was anybody's business, where she lived or\nwhat she had done, and that she had certainly no intention of gratifying\nmy idle curiosity; and that was the last word I could get out of her.Although she treated me so cavalierly, I confess to a good deal of\nsympathy with her attitude.\"\"She was\nhousekeeper here when Valdriguez first came to Geralton and ought to be\nable to tell you what sort of person she was in her youth.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.The only thing she told me which may\nhave a bearing on the case is, that in the old days his Lordship\nappeared to admire Valdriguez very much.\"\"But we cannot be too sure of this, my lord.For when I tried to find\nout what grounds she had for her statement, she had so little proof to\noffer that I cannot accept her impression as conclusive evidence.As far\nas I can make out, the gossip about them was started by his Lordship\ngoing to the Catholic church in Newhaven.\"Not a very compromising act on his Lordship's part, one would\nthink.But as his Lordship was not a Catholic, his doing so naturally\naroused a good deal of comment.At first the neighbourhood feared that\nhe had been converted by his mother, who had often lamented that she had\nnot been allowed to bring up her son in her own faith.It was soon\nnoticed, however, that whenever his Lordship attended a popish service,\nhis mother's pretty maid was invariably present, and so people began to\nput two and two together and before long it was universally assumed that\nshe was the magnet which had drawn him away from his own church.Eversley if they had been seen together elsewhere, and she\nreluctantly admitted that they had.On several occasions they were seen\nwalking in the Park but always, so Mrs.Eversley assured me, in full\nview of the castle.She had felt it her duty to speak to Valdriguez on\nthe subject, and the latter told her that his Lordship was interested in\nher religion and that she was willing to run the risk of having her\nconduct misconstrued if she could save his soul from eternal damnation.Eversley to understand that she had her mistress's\nsanction, and as her Ladyship treated Valdriguez more as a companion and\nfriend than as a maid, Mrs.Eversley thought this quite likely and did\nnot venture to remonstrate further.So the intimacy, if such it could be\ncalled, continued as before.What the outcome of this state of things\nwould have been we do not know, for shortly afterwards both Lord and\nLady Wilmersley died and Valdriguez left Geralton.When his Lordship\nwent away a few weeks later, a good many people suspected that he had\njoined her on the continent.Eversley, however, does not believe\nthis.She has the most absolute confidence in Valdriguez's virtue, and I\nthink her testimony is pretty reliable.\"Eversley is an honest, simple old soul.A clever adventuress\nwould have little difficulty in hoodwinking her.Mark my words, you have\nfound the key to the mystery.What more likely than that his\nLordship--whose morals, even as a boy, were none of the best--seduced\nValdriguez and that she returned to Geralton so as to have the\nopportunity of avenging her wrongs.\"\"I can think of nothing more unlikely than that his Lordship should have\nselected his cast-off mistress as his wife's attendant,\" Judson drily\nremarked.\"I can quite fancy\nthat the situation would have appealed to his cynical humour.\"\"Your opinion of the late Lord Wilmersley is certainly not flattering,\nbut even if we take for granted that such an arrangement would not have\nbeen impossible to his Lordship, I still refuse to believe that\nValdriguez would have agreed to it; even assuming that his Lordship had\nwronged her and that she had nursed a murderous resentment against him\nall these years, I cannot see how she could have hoped to further her\nobject by accepting the humiliating position of his wife's maid.It also", "question": "Where is Mary?

all I want to get at is the\ntruth.\"\"The truth, my lord,\" said the detective, as he rose to take his leave,\n\"is often more praised than appreciated.\"CHAPTER XV\n\nFINGER PRINTS IN THE DUST\n\n\nAs Cyril sat toying with his dinner, it was little by little borne in on\nhim that the butler had something on his mind.How he got this\nimpression he really did not know, for Douglas performed his duties as\nprecisely, as unobtrusively as ever.Yet long before the last course had\nbeen reached, Cyril was morally certain that he had not been mistaken.He waited for the dessert to be placed on the table; then, having\nmotioned the footmen to leave the room, he half turned to the butler,\nwho was standing behind his chair.The man stepped forward, so as to face his master.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.asked Cyril, scrutinising the other\nattentively.The abrupt question seemed neither to surprise nor to discompose the\nbutler; yet he hesitated before finally answering:\n\n\"I--I don't quite know, my lord.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.\"You must know whether or not\nsomething has happened to upset you.\"\"Well, my lord--it's this way, my lord--Susan, the upper 'ousemaid, says\nas how there has been somebody or--\" here his voice sank to a whisper\nand he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder--\"or something in\nthe library last night!\"Cyril put down the glass of wine he was carrying to his lips untasted.\"She thinks she saw a ghost in the library?\"She didn't see anything, but this morning she found\nfinger-marks on the top of his Lordship's desk.\"One of the servants may have gone in there out of\ncuriosity.\"\"But what would anybody be doing there in the night, I should like to\nknow?And Susan says those marks could only 'ave been made last night,\nmy lord.\"It takes time for dust to settle and a\n'ousemaid, who knows 'er business, can tell, after she's been in a place\na couple of months, just about 'ow long it's been since any particular\npiece of furniture has been dusted.No young\n'ousemaid can pull the wool over 'er eyes, I can tell you.\"\"Does every one know of Susan's suspicions?\"Susan's a sensible woman, and though she was frightened\nsomething terrible, she only told Mrs.Eversley told\nme and we three agreed we'd hold our tongues.Every one's that upset as\nit is, that they'd all 'ave 'ighstrikes if they knew that It was\nwalking.\"But even\nif there were such things, an intangible spirit couldn't possibly leave\nfinger-marks behind it.\"\"But, my lord, if you'll excuse me, my aunt's cousin--\" began the\nbutler, but Cyril cut him short.\"I have no time now to hear about your aunt's cousin, though no doubt it\nis a most interesting story.Susan had, however, no further information to impart.She was positive\nthat the marks must have been made some time during the night.\"And it's my belief they were made by a skeleton hand,\" she added.\"And\nas for going into that room again, indeed I just couldn't, not for\nnobody, meaning no disrespect to your Lordship; and as for the other\n'ousemaids, they'll not go near the place either and haven't been since\nthe murder.\"\"Very well, Susan, I shall not ask you to do so.Those rooms shall not\nbe opened again till this mystery is cleared up.I will go now and lock\nthem up myself.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.Striding rapidly across the hall, Cyril opened the door of the library.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.This part of the castle had been equipped with electric light and steam\nheat, and as he stepped into the darkness, the heavy-scented air almost\nmade him reel.Having found the switch, he noticed at once that the room\nhad indefinably changed since he had been in it last.Notwithstanding\nthe heat, notwithstanding the flood of crimson light, which permeated\neven the farthest corners, it had already assumed the chill, gloomy\naspect of an abandoned apartment.Stooping over the desk, he eagerly inspected the marks which had so\nstartled the housemaid.Yes, they were still quite visible, although a\ndelicate film of dust had already begun to soften the precision of their\noutline--very strange!They certainly did look like the imprint of\nskeleton fingers.His fingers left a\nmark at least twice as wide as those of the mysterious visitant.For a long time he stood with bent head pondering deeply; then, throwing\nback his shoulders, as if he had arrived at some decision, he proceeded\nto explore the entire suite.Having satisfied himself that no one was\nsecreted on the premises, he turned off the light, shut the door--but he\ndid not turn the key.Some hours later Cyril, in his great four-posted bed, lay watching, with\nwide-open eyes, the fantastic shadows thrown by the dancing firelight on\nthe panelled walls.To woo sleep was evidently not his intention, for\nfrom time to time he lighted a wax vesta and consulted the watch he held\nin his hand.At last the hour seemed to satisfy him, for he got out of\nbed and made a hasty toilet.Having accomplished this as best he could\nin the semi-obscurity, he slipped a pistol into his pocket and left his\nroom.Groping his way through the darkness, he descended the stairs and\ncautiously traversed the hall.His stockinged\nfeet moved noiselessly over the heavy carpet.At the door of the library\nhe paused a moment and listened intently; then, pistol in hand, he threw\nopen the door.Closing the\ndoor behind him, he lighted a match and carefully inspected the desk.Having assured himself that no fresh marks had appeared on its polished\nsurface, he blew out the match and ensconced himself as comfortably as\nthe limited space permitted behind the curtains of one of the windows.There he waited patiently for what seemed to him an eternity.He had\njust begun to fear that his vigil would prove fruitless, when his ear\nwas gladdened by a slight sound.A moment later the light was switched\non.Hardly daring to breathe, Cyril peered through the curtains.Cyril's heart gave a bound of exultation.Had he not guessed\nthat those marks could only have been made by her small, bony fingers?Clad like a nun in a loose, black garment, which fell in straight,\naustere folds to her feet; a black shawl, thrown over her head, casting\nstrange shadows on her pale, haggard face, she advanced slowly, almost\nmajestically, into the room.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.Cyril had to acknowledge that she looked\nmore like a medieval saint than a midnight marauder.Evidently the woman had no fear of detection, for she never even cast\none suspicious glance around her; nor did she appear to feel that there\nwas any necessity for haste, for she lingered for some time near the\nwriting-table, gazing at it, as if it had a fascination for her; but,\nfinally, she turned away with a hopeless sigh and directed her attention\nto the bookcase.This she proceeded to examine in the most methodical\nmanner.Book after book was taken down, shaken, and the binding\ncarefully scrutinised.Having cleared a shelf, she drew a tape measure\nfrom her pocket and rapped and measured the back and sides of the case\nitself.What on earth could she be looking for, wondered Cyril.For his cousin's will, executed at the date of his marriage, had\nbeen found safely deposited with his solicitor.One in which she hoped that her master had remembered her, as he had\nprobably promised her that he would?Well, there was no further need of concealment, he decided, so, parting\nthe curtains, he stepped into the room.His own voice startled him, it rang out so loud and harsh in the silence\nof the night.Valdriguez knelt on the floor with her back to him, and it seemed as if\nthe sudden shock had paralysed her, for she made no effort to move, and\nher hand, arrested in the act of replacing a book, remained\noutstretched, as if it had been turned to stone.He saw her shudder convulsively, then slowly she raised her head, and as\nher great, tragic eyes met his, Cyril was conscious of a revulsion of\nfeeling toward her.Never had he seen anything so hopeless yet so\nundaunted as the look she gave him.It reminded him, curiously enough,\nof a look he had once seen in the eyes of a lioness, who, with a bullet\nthrough her heart, still fought to protect her young.Staggering a little as she rose, Valdriguez nevertheless managed to draw\nherself up to her full height.\"I am here, my lord, to get what is mine--mine,\" she repeated almost\nfiercely.It was absurd, he reasoned, to allow\nhimself to be impressed by her strange personality.he exclaimed; and the very fact that he was more than\nhalf-inclined to believe her, made him speak more roughly than he would\notherwise have done.\"Think what you like,\" she cried, shrugging her shoulders\ncontemptuously.\"Have me arrested--have me hung--what do I care?\"So you confess that it was you who murdered his Lordship?Your sanctimonious airs didn't deceive me,\" exclaimed\nCyril triumphantly.\"No, I did not murder him,\" she replied calmly, almost indifferently.\"I think you will have some difficulty convincing the police of that.You have no alibi to prove that you were not in these rooms at the time\nof the murder, and now when I tell them that I found you trying to\nsteal----\"\n\n\"I am no thief,\" she interrupted him with blazing eyes.\"I tell you, I\ncame here to get what is mine by right.\"Even if what you say were\ntrue, you would not have had to sneak in here in the middle of the\nnight.You know very well that I should have made no objections to your\nclaiming your own.\"But if I had gone to you and told you that a great lord had\nrobbed me, a poor woman, of something which is dearer to me than life\nitself, would you have believed me?If I had said to you, 'I must look\nthrough his Lordship's papers; I must be free to search everywhere,'\nwould you have given me permission to do so?That it was because I was ashamed of my errand that I came here at\nthis hour?All I feared was that I should be prevented from\ndiscovering the truth.Valdriguez's voice suddenly dropped\nand she seemed to forget Cyril's presence.She\ncontinued speaking as if to herself and her wild eyes swept feverishly\naround the room.\"He told me it was here--and yet how can I be sure of\nit?He may have lied to me about this as he did about everything else.I cannot bear it any\nlonger, oh, my God!\"she cried, clasping her hands and lifting her\nstreaming eyes to heaven, \"Thou knowest that I have striven all my life\nto do Thy will; I have borne the cross that Thou sawest fit to lay upon\nme without a murmur, nor have I once begged for mercy at Thy hands; but\nnow, now, oh, my Father, I beseech thee, give me to know the truth\nbefore I die----\"\n\nCyril watched the woman narrowly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.He felt that he must try and maintain\na judicial attitude toward her and not allow himself to be led astray by\nhis sympathies which, as he knew to his cost, were only too easily\naroused.After all, he reasoned, was it not more than likely that she\nwas delivering this melodramatic tirade for his benefit?On the other\nhand, it was against his principles as well as against his inclinations\nto deal harshly with a woman.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.\"Calm yourself, Valdriguez,\" he said at last.\"If you can convince me\nthat his Lordship had in his possession something which rightfully\nbelonged to you, I promise that, if it can be found, it shall be\nrestored to you.Tell me, what it is that you are looking for?\"You promise--so did he--the\nsmooth-tongued villain!Never\nwill I trust one of his race again.\"\"You have got to trust me whether you want to or not.Your position\ncould not be worse than it is, could it?Don't you see that your only\nhope lies in being able to persuade me that you are an honest woman?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.For the first time Valdriguez looked at Cyril attentively.He felt as if\nher great eyes were probing his very soul.\"Indeed, you do not look cruel or deceitful.And, as you say, I am\npowerless without you, so I must take the risk of your being what you\nseem.But first, my lord, will you swear not\nto betray my secret to any living being?\"That is--\" he hastily added, \"if it has\nnothing to do with the murder.\"CHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE STORY OF A WRONG\n\n\nCyril waited for her to continue, but for a long time it seemed doubtful\nif she would have the courage to do so.\"I am looking,\" she said at last, speaking slowly and with a visible\neffort, \"for a paper which will tell me whether my--son is alive or\ndead.\"So you were his Lordship's mistress----\"\n\n\"Before God I was his wife!\"The old story--\" began Cyril, but Valdriguez stopped him with a furious\ngesture.\"Do not dare to say that my child's mother was a loose woman!Arthur Wilmersley--may his Maker judge him as he\ndeserves--wrecked my life, but at least he never doubted my virtue.He\nknew that the only way to get me was to marry me.\"\"No--but for a long time I believed that he had.How could a young,\ninnocent girl have suspected that the man she loved was capable of such\ncold-blooded deception?Even now, I cannot blame myself for having\nfallen into the trap he baited with such fiendish cunning.Think of\nit--he induced me to consent to a secret marriage by promising that if I\nmade this sacrifice for his sake, he would become a convert to my\nreligion--my religion!And as we stood together before the altar, I\nremember that I thanked God for giving me this opportunity of saving a\nsoul from destruction.I never dreamed that the church he took me to was\nnothing but an old ruin he had fitted up as a chapel for the occasion.How could I guess that the man who married us was not a priest but a\nmountebank, whom he had hired to act the part?\"Valdriguez bowed her head and the tears trickled through her thin\nfingers.\"I know that not many people would believe you but, well--I do.\"It\nseemed to Cyril as if the words sprang to his lips unbidden.\"Then indeed you are a good man,\" exclaimed Valdriguez, \"for it is given\nonly to honest people to have a sure ear for the truth.Now it will be\neasier to tell you the rest.Some weeks after we had gone through this\nceremony, first Lord and then Lady Wilmersley died;

but his Majesty\nsigned all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,\nnot acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the\npenalty of the late Act against <DW7>s and Dissenters holding offices,\nand refusing the oath and test.Every one was glad of this change, those\nin the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the\ngreat damage of the Navy.The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of\nLuxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the\nHollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted\nby the French.I received L600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee\nfarm of Pilton, in Devon.Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,\nnewly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr.Can observed that, in the\n27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the\nfore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is\nvery true our seamen do not do so;

to such a mad intemperance was\nthe age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate\nalready to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large\nagain as it was within my memory.[Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now\n    called London?]Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn\nfor treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in\nHolland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,\nwhich gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was\non an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]\n\n    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on\n    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in\n    within a year, and the year not having expired.Jefferies refused\n    it;

the leaves dropping\nfrom the trees as in autumn.I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,\nwhere after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor\nPietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,\nthe other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding\nhim.There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice\n[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,\nwho dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in\nEngland had known.We had not had above one or two\nconsiderable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many\ntrees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was\na numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the\nPresidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner\nof the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of\nState, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very\nunexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,\nto his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the\nrhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought\ninto England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold\n(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a\ncrocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the\nEgyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of\nNorthumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well\nbred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his\ncampaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of\nwhich he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth\nthe owning.What the\nDukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet\ndiscover;

till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely\nupon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at\nWhitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the\nChurch of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of\nRome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our\nChurch and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and\nrebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my\ncertain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks\non the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and\nother devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and\nmottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But\nthe most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very\nwater, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and\nthen appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with\ngrenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It\nwas concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants\ndanced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich\nin apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say\nand Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the\nMint), to see Mr.The series of Popes\nwas rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John\nHuss's martyrdom at Constance;

which might have been of direful\nconsequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this\nDoctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary\ndexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him\nbleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other\nphysicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which\nhe must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.This rescued his Majesty\nfor the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,\nand was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,\ntill Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and\nboth vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of\nrecovery were signified in the public \"Gazette,\" but that day about\nnoon, the physicians thought him feverish.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.This they seemed glad of, as\nbeing more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former\nfits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him\nworse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a\nfever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp\noperations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder\nmight stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made\nhim very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when\ncomplaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood\nfrom him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him\nrelief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and\nstruggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the\nphysicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after\neleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th\nyear of his reign, and 54th of his age.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the\nCourt Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half\nquarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he\nexpired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those\nwho assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,\nthe Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the\nBishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the\nreceiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of\nit, which he did so long till it was too late.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Others whispered that the\nBishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered\nto withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to\nadminister the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke\nwho was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He\nalso recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the\nDuke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated\nthe Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had\nsent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard\nof her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if\nat any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the\nDuchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might\nnot starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and\n    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,\n    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do\n    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common\n    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where\n    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,\n    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,\n    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him\n    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the\n    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased\n    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being\n    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that\n    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and\n    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and\n    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little\n    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a\n    priest, to which the King replied: \"For God's sake, brother, do, and\n    lose no time.\"The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none\n    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant\n    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back\n    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the\n    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the\n    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the\n    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being\n    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the\n    Sacrament.--\"Life of James II.\"]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and\nin all appearance promising a long life.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.He was a prince of many\nvirtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not\nbloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of\nperson, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in\nshipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew\nof many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he\nloved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,\nwhich passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular\ntalent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had\ninnumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too\npresumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took\ndelight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his\nbedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,\nwhich rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty\nand stinking.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he\nbeen less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to\nsupply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent\npersons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently\nand easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not\nhere I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious\nopportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,\nand prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature\nresigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane\nwretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he\nhad been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much\nexperience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures\ntook him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history\nof his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of\nmatter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical\ndeath of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous\nrestoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,\nfires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand\nother particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all\noccasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his\nloss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately\nto Council, and before entering into any business, passionately\ndeclaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession\nhad fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his\npredecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however\nhe had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should\nfind the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as\ngreat a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain\nthe Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its\nprinciples being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing\nthemselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never\ndepart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would\nnever invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life\nin defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in\nall its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words\n    employed) of what is stated by King James II.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.printed in\n    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England\n    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, \"AND THEREFORE I SHALL\n    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT.\"James then goes on to\n    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,\n    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then\n    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that\n    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,\n    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty\n    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing\n    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to\n    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The\n    King afterward proceeds to say: \"No one can wonder that Mr.Finch\n    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the\n    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass\n    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to\n    promise both security to their religion and protection to their\n    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by\n    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established\n    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he\n    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the\n    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience\n    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his\n    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or\n    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,\n    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they\n    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a\n    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of\n    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it\n    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he\n    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in\n    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended\n    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further\n    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath\n    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained\n    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in\n    England.\"--\"Life of James II.,\" ii.The words printed in small\n    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son", "question": "Where is Daniel?

desire to attest that this erring constable is the\nhusband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if\nnot admiration.As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be\nreserved for another time--another place.[_To GEORGIANA._] To you,\nwhose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I\ngive this earnest admonition.Within an hour from this terrible\nmoment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing\nman's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared.[_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him

\"it is not God who deserts us, it is we who desert him, and\ndishonour ourselves by disgracing and betraying the cause of freedom and\nreligion.--Hear me,\" he exclaimed, springing to the pulpit which\nMucklewrath had been compelled to evacuate by actual exhaustion--\"I bring\nfrom the enemy an offer to treat, if you incline to lay down your arms.I\ncan assure you the means of making an honourable defence, if you are of\nmore manly tempers.Let us resolve either for\npeace or war; and let it not be said of us in future days, that six\nthousand Scottish men in arms had neither courage to stand their ground\nand fight it out, nor prudence to treat for peace, nor even the coward's\nwisdom to retreat in good time and with safety.What signifies\nquarrelling on minute points of church-discipline, when the whole edifice\nis threatened with total destruction?O, remember, my brethren, that the\nlast and worst evil which God brought upon the people whom he had once\nchosen--the last and worst punishment of their blindness and hardness of\nheart, was the bloody dissensions which rent asunder their city, even\nwhen the enemy were thundering at its gates!\"Some of the audience testified their feeling of this exhortation, by loud\nexclamations of applause; others by hooting, and exclaiming--\"To your\ntents, O Israel!\"Morton, who beheld the columns of the enemy already beginning to appear\non the right bank, and directing their march upon the bridge, raised his\nvoice to its utmost pitch, and, pointing at the same time with his hand,\nexclaimed,--\"Silence your senseless clamours, yonder is the enemy!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.On\nmaintaining the bridge against him depend our lives, as well as our hope\nto reclaim our laws and liberties.--There shall at least one Scottishman\ndie in their defence.--Let any one who loves his country follow me!\"The multitude had turned their heads in the direction to which he\npointed.The sight of the glittering files of the English Foot-Guards,\nsupported by several squadrons of horse, of the cannon which the\nartillerymen were busily engaged in planting against the bridge, of the\nplaided clans who seemed to search for a ford, and of the long succession\nof troops which were destined to support the attack, silenced at once\ntheir clamorous uproar, and struck them with as much consternation as if\nit were an unexpected apparition, and not the very thing which they ought\nto have been looking out for.They gazed on each other, and on their\nleaders, with looks resembling those that indicate the weakness of a\npatient when exhausted by a fit of frenzy.Yet when Morton, springing\nfrom the rostrum, directed his steps towards the bridge, he was followed\nby about an hundred of the young men who were particularly attached to\nhis command.Burley turned to Macbriar--\"Ephraim,\" he said, \"it is Providence points\nus the way, through the worldly wisdom of this latitudinarian youth.--He\nthat loves the light, let him follow Burley!\"\"Tarry,\" replied Macbriar; \"it is not by Henry Morton, or such as he,\nthat our goings-out and our comings-in are to be meted; therefore tarry\nwith us.I fear treachery to the host from this nullifidian Achan--Thou\nshalt not go with him.Thou art our chariots and our horsemen.\"\"Hinder me not,\" replied Burley; \"he hath well said that all is lost, if\nthe enemy win the bridge--therefore let me not.Shall the children of\nthis generation be called wiser or braver than the children of the\nsanctuary?--Array yourselves under your leaders--let us not lack supplies\nof men and ammunition; and accursed be he who turneth back from the work\non this great day!\"Having thus spoken, he hastily marched towards the bridge, and was\nfollowed by about two hundred of the most gallant and zealous of his\nparty.There was a deep and disheartened pause when Morton and Burley\ndeparted.The commanders availed themselves of it to display their lines\nin some sort of order, and exhorted those who were most exposed to throw\nthemselves upon their faces to avoid the cannonade which they might\npresently expect.The insurgents ceased to resist or to remonstrate; but\nthe awe which had silenced their discords had dismayed their courage.They suffered themselves to be formed into ranks with the docility of a\nflock of sheep, but without possessing, for the time, more resolution or\nenergy; for they experienced a sinking of the heart, imposed by the\nsudden and imminent approach of the danger which they had neglected to\nprovide against while it was yet distant.They were, however, drawn out\nwith some regularity; and as they still possessed the appearance of an\narmy, their leaders had only to hope that some favourable circumstance\nwould restore their spirits and courage.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.Kettledrummle, Poundtext, Macbriar, and other preachers, busied\nthemselves in their ranks, and prevailed on them to raise a psalm.But\nthe superstitious among them observed, as an ill omen, that their song of\npraise and triumph sunk into \"a quaver of consternation,\" and resembled\nrather a penitentiary stave sung on the scaffold of a condemned criminal,\nthan the bold strain which had resounded along the wild heath of\nLoudon-hill, in anticipation of that day's victory.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.The melancholy melody\nsoon received a rough accompaniment; the royal soldiers shouted, the\nHighlanders yelled, the cannon began to fire on one side, and the\nmusketry on both, and the bridge of Bothwell, with the banks adjacent,\nwere involved in wreaths of smoke.As e'er ye saw the rain doun fa',\n                    Or yet the arrow from the bow,\n                    Sae our Scots lads fell even down,\n                    And they lay slain on every knowe.Ere Morton or Burley had reached the post to be defended, the enemy had\ncommenced an attack upon it with great spirit.The two regiments of\nFoot-Guards, formed into a close column, rushed forward to the river; one\ncorps, deploying along the right bank, commenced a galling fire on the\ndefenders of the pass, while the other pressed on to occupy the bridge.The insurgents sustained the attack with great constancy and courage; and\nwhile part of their number returned the fire across the river, the rest\nmaintained a discharge of musketry upon the further end of the bridge\nitself, and every avenue by which the soldiers endeavoured to approach\nit.The latter suffered severely, but still gained ground, and the head\nof their column was already upon the bridge, when the arrival of Morton\nchanged the scene; and his marksmen, commencing upon the pass a fire as\nwell aimed as it was sustained and regular, compelled the assailants to\nretire with much loss.They were a second time brought up to the charge,\nand a second time repulsed with still greater loss, as Burley had now\nbrought his party into action.The fire was continued with the utmost\nvehemence on both sides, and the issue of the action seemed very dubious.Monmouth, mounted on a superb white charger, might be discovered on the\ntop of the right bank of the river, urging, entreating, and animating the\nexertions of his soldiers.By his orders, the cannon, which had hitherto\nbeen employed in annoying the distant main body of the presbyterians,\nwere now turned upon the defenders of the bridge.But these tremendous\nengines, being wrought much more slowly than in modern times, did not\nproduce the effect of annoying or terrifying the enemy to the extent\nproposed.The insurgents, sheltered by copsewood along the bank of the\nriver, or stationed in the houses already mentioned, fought under cover,\nwhile the royalists, owing to the precautions of Morton, were entirely\nexposed.The defence was so protracted and obstinate, that the royal\ngenerals began to fear it might be ultimately successful.While Monmouth\nthrew himself from his horse, and, rallying the Foot-Guards, brought them\non to another close and desperate attack, he was warmly seconded\nby Dalzell, who, putting himself at the head of a body of\nLennox-Highlanders, rushed forward with their tremendous war-cry of\nLoch-sloy.[Note: This was the slogan or war-cry of the MacFarlanes, taken from\n     a lake near the head of Loch Lomond, in the centre of their ancient\n     possessions on the western banks of that beautiful inland sea.]The ammunition of the defenders of the bridge began to fail at this\nimportant crisis; messages, commanding and imploring succours and\nsupplies, were in vain dispatched, one after the other, to the main body\nof the presbyterian army, which remained inactively drawn up on the open\nfields in the rear.Fear, consternation, and misrule, had gone abroad\namong them, and while the post on which their safety depended required\nto be instantly and powerfully reinforced, there remained none either to\ncommand or to obey.As the fire of the defenders of the bridge began to slacken, that of the\nassailants increased, and in its turn became more fatal.Animated by the\nexample and exhortations of their generals, they obtained a footing upon\nthe bridge itself, and began to remove the obstacles by which it was\nblockaded.The portal-gate was broke open, the beams, trunks of trees,\nand other materials of the barricade, pulled down and thrown into the\nriver.Morton and Burley\nfought in the very front of their followers, and encouraged them with\ntheir pikes, halberds, and partisans, to encounter the bayonets of the\nGuards, and the broadswords of the Highlanders.But those behind the\nleaders began to shrink from the unequal combat, and fly singly, or in\nparties of two or three, towards the main body, until the remainder were,\nby the mere weight of the hostile column as much as by their weapons,\nfairly forced from the bridge.The passage being now open, the enemy\nbegan to pour over.But the bridge was long and narrow, which rendered\nthe manoeuvre slow as well as dangerous; and those who first passed had\nstill to force the houses, from the windows of which the Covenanters\ncontinued to fire.Burley and Morton were near each other at this\ncritical moment.\"There is yet time,\" said the former, \"to bring down horse to attack\nthem, ere they can get into order; and, with the aid of God, we may thus\nregain the bridge--hasten thou to bring them down, while I make the\ndefence good with this old and wearied body.\"Morton saw the importance of the advice, and, throwing himself on the\nhorse which cuddie held in readiness for him behind the thicket, galloped\ntowards a body of cavalry which chanced to be composed entirely of\nCameronians.Ere he could speak his errand, or utter his orders, he was\nsaluted by the execrations of the whole body.they exclaimed--\"the cowardly traitor flies like a hart from\nthe hunters, and hath left valiant Burley in the midst of the slaughter!\"Advance\nboldly, and we shall yet do well.\"--such were the tumultuous exclamations\nwhich resounded from the ranks;--\"he hath sold you to the sword of the\nenemy!\"And while Morton argued, entreated, and commanded in vain, the moment was\nlost in which the advance might have been useful; and the outlet from the\nbridge, with all its defences, being in complete possession of the enemy,\nBurley and his remaining", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "In the meanwhile, the forces of the King crossed the bridge at their\nleisure, and, securing the pass, formed in line of battle; while\nClaverhouse, who, like a hawk perched on a rock, and eyeing the time to\npounce on its prey, had watched the event of the action from the opposite\nbank, now passed the bridge at the head of his cavalry, at full trot,\nand, leading them in squadrons through the intervals and round the flanks\nof the royal infantry, formed them in line on the moor, and led them to\nthe charge, advancing in front with one large body, while other two\ndivisions threatened the flanks of the Covenanters.Their devoted army\nwas now in that situation when the slightest demonstration towards an\nattack was certain to inspire panic.Their broken spirits and\ndisheartened courage were unable to endure the charge of the cavalry,\nattended with all its terrible accompaniments of sight and sound;--the\nrush of the horses at full speed, the shaking of the earth under their\nfeet, the glancing of the swords, the waving of the plumes, and the\nfierce shouts of the cavaliers.The front ranks hardly attempted one\nill-directed and disorderly fire, and their rear were broken and flying\nin confusion ere the charge had been completed; and in less than five\nminutes the horsemen were mixed with them, cutting and hewing without\nmercy.The voice of Claverhouse was heard, even above the din of\nconflict, exclaiming to his soldiers--\"Kill, kill--no quarter--think on\nRichard Grahame!\"The dragoons, many of whom had shared the disgrace of\nLoudon-hill, required no exhortations to vengeance as easy as it was\ncomplete.Their swords drank deep of slaughter among the unresisting\nfugitives.Screams for quarter were only answered by the shouts with\nwhich the pursuers accompanied their blows, and the whole field presented\none general scene of confused slaughter, flight, and pursuit.About twelve hundred of the insurgents who remained in a body a little\napart from the rest, and out of the line of the charge of cavalry, threw\ndown their arms and surrendered at discretion, upon the approach of the\nDuke of Monmouth at the head of the infantry.That mild-tempered nobleman\ninstantly allowed them the quarter which they prayed for; and, galloping\nabout through the field, exerted himself as much to stop the slaughter as\nhe had done to obtain the victory.While busied in this humane task he\nmet with General Dalzell, who was encouraging the fierce Highlanders and\nroyal volunteers to show their zeal for King and country, by quenching\nthe flame of the rebellion with the blood of the rebels.\"Sheathe your sword, I command you, General!\"exclaimed the Duke, \"and\nsound the retreat.Enough of blood has been shed; give quarter to the\nKing's misguided subjects.\"\"I obey your Grace,\" said the old man, wiping his bloody sword and\nreturning it to the scabbard; \"but I warn you, at the same time, that\nenough has not been done to intimidate these desperate rebels.Has not\nyour Grace heard that Basil Olifant has collected several gentlemen and\nmen of substance in the west, and is in the act of marching to join\nthem?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.said the Duke; \"who, or what is he?\"\"The next male heir to the last Earl of Torwood.He is disaffected to\ngovernment from his claim to the estate being set aside in favour of Lady\nMargaret Bellenden; and I suppose the hope of getting the inheritance has\nset him in motion.\"\"Be his motives what they will,\" replied Monmouth, \"he must soon disperse\nhis followers, for this army is too much broken to rally again.Therefore, once more, I command that the pursuit be stopped.\"\"It is your Grace's province to command, and to be responsible for your\ncommands,\" answered Dalzell, as he gave reluctant orders for checking the\npursuit.But the fiery and vindictive Grahame was already far out of hearing of\nthe signal of retreat, and continued with his cavalry an unwearied and\nbloody pursuit, breaking, dispersing, and cutting to pieces all the\ninsurgents whom they could come up with.Burley and Morton were both hurried off the field by the confused tide of\nfugitives.They made some attempt to defend the streets of the town of\nHamilton; but, while labouring to induce the fliers to face about and\nstand to their weapons.Burley received a bullet which broke his\nsword-arm.\"May the hand be withered that shot the shot!\"he exclaimed, as the sword\nwhich he was waving over his head fell powerless to his side.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.[Note: This incident, and Burley's exclamation, are\ntaken from the records.]Then turning his horse's head, he retreated out of the confusion.Morton\nalso now saw that the continuing his unavailing efforts to rally the\nfliers could only end in his own death or captivity, and, followed by the\nfaithful Cuddie, he extricated himself from the press, and, being well\nmounted, leaped his horse over one or two enclosures, and got into the\nopen country.From the first hill which they gained in their flight, they looked back,\nand beheld the whole country covered with their fugitive companions, and\nwith the pursuing dragoons, whose wild shouts and halloo, as they did\nexecution on the groups whom they overtook, mingled with the groans and\nscreams of their victims, rose shrilly up the hill.\"It is impossible they can ever make head again,\" said Morton.\"The head's taen aff them, as clean as I wad bite it aff a sybo!\"They'll be cunning that catches me at this wark\nagain.--But, for God's sake, sir, let us mak for some strength!\"Morton saw the necessity of following the advice of his trusty squire.They resumed a rapid pace, and continued it without intermission,\ndirecting their course towards the wild and mountainous country, where\nthey thought it likely some part of the fugitives might draw together,\nfor the sake either of making defence, or of obtaining terms.They require\n               Of Heaven the hearts of lions, breath of tigers,\n               Yea and the fierceness too.Evening had fallen; and, for the last two hours, they had seen none of\ntheir ill-fated companions, when Morton and his faithful attendant gained\nthe moorland, and approached a large and solitary farmhouse, situated in\nthe entrance of a wild glen, far remote from any other habitation.\"Our horses,\" said Morton, \"will carry us no farther without rest or\nfood, and we must try to obtain them here, if possible.\"So speaking, he led the way to the house.The place had every appearance\nof being inhabited.There was smoke issuing from the chimney in a\nconsiderable volume, and the marks of recent hoofs were visible around\nthe door.They could even hear the murmuring of human voices within the\nhouse.But all the lower windows were closely secured; and when they\nknocked at the door, no answer was returned.After vainly calling and\nentreating admittance, they withdrew to the stable, or shed, in order to\naccommodate their horses, ere they used farther means of gaining\nadmission.In this place they found ten or twelve horses, whose state of\nfatigue, as well as the military yet disordered appearance of their\nsaddles and accoutrements, plainly indicated that their owners were\nfugitive insurgents in their own circumstances.\"This meeting bodes luck,\" said Cuddie; \"and they hae walth o' beef,\nthat's ae thing certain, for here's a raw hide that has been about the\nhurdies o' a stot not half an hour syne--it's warm yet.\"Encouraged by these appearances, they returned again to the house, and,\nannouncing themselves as men in the same predicament with the inmates,\nclamoured loudly for admittance.\"Whoever ye be,\" answered a stern voice from the window, after a long and\nobdurate silence, \"disturb not those who mourn for the desolation and\ncaptivity of the land, and search out the causes of wrath and of\ndefection, that the stumbling-blocks may be removed over which we have\nstumbled.\"\"They are wild western whigs,\" said Cuddie, in a whisper to his master,\n\"I ken by their language.Fiend hae me, if I like to venture on them!\"Morton, however, again called to the party within, and insisted on\nadmittance; but, finding his entreaties still disregarded, he opened one\nof the lower windows, and pushing asunder the shutters, which were but\nslightly secured, stepped into the large kitchen from which the voice had\nissued.Cuddie followed him, muttering betwixt his teeth, as he put his\nhead within the window, \"That he hoped there was nae scalding brose on\nthe fire;\" and master and servant both found themselves in the company of\nten or twelve armed men, seated around the fire, on which refreshments\nwere preparing, and busied apparently in their devotions.In the gloomy countenances, illuminated by the fire-light, Morton had no\ndifficulty in recognising several of those zealots who had most\ndistinguished themselves by their intemperate opposition to all moderate\nmeasures, together with their noted pastor, the fanatical Ephraim\nMacbriar, and the maniac, Habakkuk Mucklewrath.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.The Cameronians neither\nstirred tongue nor hand to welcome their brethren in misfortune, but\ncontinued to listen to the low murmured exercise of Macbriar, as he\nprayed that the Almighty would lift up his hand from his people, and not\nmake an end in the day of his anger.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.That they were conscious of the\npresence of the intruders only appeared from the sullen and indignant\nglances which they shot at them, from time to time, as their eyes\nencountered.Morton, finding into what unfriendly society he had unwittingly intruded,\nbegan to think of retreating; but, on turning his head, observed with\nsome alarm, that two strong men had silently placed themselves beside the\nwindow, through which they had entered.One of these ominous sentinels\nwhispered to Cuddie, \"Son of that precious woman, Mause Headrigg, do not\ncast thy lot farther with this child of treachery and perdition--Pass on\nthy way, and tarry not, for the avenger of blood is behind thee.\"With this he pointed to the window, out of which Cuddie jumped without\nhesitation; for the intimation he had received plainly implied the\npersonal danger he would otherwise incur.\"Winnocks are no lucky wi' me,\" was his first reflection when he was in\nthe open air; his next was upon the probable fate of his master.\"They'll\nkill him, the murdering loons, and think they're doing a gude turn!but\nI'se tak the back road for Hamilton, and see if I canna get some o' our\nain folk to bring help in time of needcessity.\"So saying, Cuddie hastened to the stable, and taking the best horse he\ncould find instead of his own tired animal, he galloped off in the\ndirection he proposed.The noise of his horse's tread alarmed for an instant the devotion of the\nfanatics.As it died in the distance, Macbriar brought his exercise to a\nconclusion, and his audience raised themselves from the stooping posture,\nand louring downward look, with which they had listened to it, and all\nfixed their eyes sternly on Henry Morton.\"You bend strange countenances on me, gentlemen,\" said he, addressing\nthem.\"I am totally ignorant in what manner I can have deserved them.\"exclaimed Mucklewrath, starting up: \"the\nword that thou hast spurned shall become a rock to crush and to bruise\nthee; the spear which thou wouldst have broken shall pierce thy side; we\nhave prayed, and wrestled, and petitioned for an offering to atone the\nsins of the congregation, and lo!the very head of the offence is\ndelivered into our hand.He hath burst in like a thief through the\nwindow; he is a ram caught in the thicket, whose blood shall be a\ndrink-offering to redeem vengeance from the church, and the place shall\nfrom henceforth be called Jehovah-Jireh, for the sacrifice is provided.Up then, and bind the victim with cords to the horns of the altar!\"There was a movement among the party; and deeply did Morton regret at\nthat moment the incautious haste with which he had ventured into their\ncompany.He was armed only with his sword, for he had left his pistols at\nthe bow of his saddle; and, as the whigs were all provided with\nfire-arms, there was little or no chance of escaping from them by\nresistance.The interposition, however, of Macbriar protected him for the\nmoment.\"Tarry yet a while, brethren--let us not use the sword rashly, lest the\nload of innocent blood lie heavy on us.--Come,\" he said, addressing\nhimself to Morton, \"we will reckon with thee ere we avenge the cause thou\nhast betrayed.--Hast thou not,\" he continued, \"made thy face as hard as\nflint against the truth in all the assemblies of the host?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.\"He has--he has,\" murmured the deep voices of the assistants.\"He hath ever urged peace with the malignants,\" said one.\"And pleaded for the dark and dismal guilt of the Indulgence,\" said\nanother.\"And would have surrendered the host into the hands of Monmouth,\" echoed\na third; \"and was the first to desert the honest and manly Burley, while\nhe yet resisted at the pass.I saw him on the moor, with his horse bloody\nwith spurring, long ere the firing had ceased at the bridge.\"\"Gentlemen,\" said Morton, \"if you mean to bear me down by clamour, and\ntake my life without hearing me, it is perhaps a thing in your power; but\nyou will sin before God and man by the commission of such a murder.\"\"I say, hear the youth,\" said Macbriar; \"for Heaven knows our bowels have\nyearned for him, that he might be brought to see the truth, and exert his\ngifts in its defence.But he is blinded by his carnal knowledge, and has\nspurned the light when it blazed before him.\"Silence being obtained, Morton proceeded to assert the good faith which\nhe had displayed in the treaty with Monmouth, and the active part he had\nborne in the subsequent action.\"I may not, gentlemen,\" he said, \"be fully able to go the lengths you\ndesire, in assigning to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing\nover others; but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful\nfreedom.And I must needs aver, that had others been of my mind in\ncounsel, or disposed to stand by my side in battle, we should this\nevening, instead of being a defeated and discordant remnant, have\nsheathed our weapons in an useful and honourable peace, or brandished\nthem triumphantly after a decisive victory.\"\"He hath spoken the word,\" said one of the assembly--\"he hath avowed his\ncarnal self-seeking and Erastianism; let him die the death!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.\"Peace yet again,\" said Macbriar, \"for I will try him further.--Was it\nnot by thy means that the malignant Evandale twice escaped from death and\ncaptivity?Was it not through thee that Miles Bellenden and his garrison\nof cut-throats were saved from the edge of the sword?\"\"I am proud to say, that you have spoken the truth in both instances,\"\nreplied Morton.you see,\" said Macbriar, \"again hath his mouth spoken it.--And didst\nthou not do this for the sake of a Midianitish woman, one of the spawn of\nprelacy, a toy with which the arch-enemy's trap is baited?Didst thou not\ndo all this for the sake of Edith Bellenden?\"\"You are incapable,\" answered Morton, boldly, \"of appreciating my\nfeelings towards that young lady;

\"it is not for thee to\ninstruct tender professors, or to construe Covenant obligations.For the\nrest, you have acknowledged enough of sin and sorrowful defection, to\ndraw down defeat on a host, were it as numerous as the sands on the\nsea-shore.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.And it is our judgment, that we are not free to let you pass\nfrom us safe and in life, since Providence hath given you into our hands\nat the moment that we prayed with godly Joshua, saying, 'What shall we\nsay when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?'--Then camest\nthou, delivered to us as it were by lot, that thou mightest sustain the\npunishment of one that hath wrought folly in Israel.This is the Sabbath, and our hand shall not be on thee to spill\nthy blood upon this day; but, when the twelfth hour shall strike, it is a\ntoken that thy time on earth hath run!Wherefore improve thy span, for it\nflitteth fast away.--Seize on the prisoner, brethren, and take his\nweapon.\"The command was so unexpectedly given, and so suddenly executed by those\nof the party who had gradually closed behind and around Morton, that he\nwas overpowered, disarmed, and a horse-girth passed round his arms,\nbefore he could offer any effectual resistance.When this was\naccomplished, a dead and stern silence took place.The fanatics ranged\nthemselves around a large oaken table, placing Morton amongst them bound\nand helpless, in such a manner as to be opposite to the clock which was\nto strike his knell.Food was placed before them, of which they offered\ntheir intended victim a share; but, it will readily be believed, he had\nlittle appetite.When this was removed, the party resumed their\ndevotions.Macbriar, whose fierce zeal did not perhaps exclude some\nfeelings of doubt and compunction, began to expostulate in prayer, as if\nto wring from the Deity a signal that the bloody sacrifice they proposed\nwas an acceptable service.The eyes and ears of his hearers were\nanxiously strained, as if to gain some sight or sound which might be\nconverted or wrested into a type of approbation, and ever and anon dark\nlooks were turned on the dial-plate of the time-piece, to watch its\nprogress towards the moment of execution.Morton's eye frequently took the same course, with the sad reflection,\nthat there appeared no posibility of his life being expanded beyond the\nnarrow segment which the index had yet to travel on the circle until it\narrived at the fatal hour.Faith in his religion, with a constant\nunyielding principle of honour, and the sense of conscious innocence,\nenabled him to pass through this dreadful interval with less agitation\nthan he himself could have expected, had the situation been prophesied to\nhim.Yet there was a want of that eager and animating sense of right\nwhich supported him in similar circumstances, when in the power of\nClaverhouse.Then he was conscious, that, amid the spectators, were many\nwho were lamenting his condition, and some who applauded his conduct.But\nnow, among these pale-eyed and ferocious zealots, whose hardened brows\nwere soon to be bent, not merely with indifference, but with triumph,\nupon his execution,--without a friend to speak a kindly word, or give a\nlook either of sympathy or encouragement,--awaiting till the sword\ndestined to slay him crept out of the scabbard gradually, and as it were\nby strawbreadths, and condemned to drink the bitterness of death drop by\ndrop,--it is no wonder that his feelings were less composed than they had\nbeen on any former occasion of danger.His destined executioners, as he\ngazed around them, seemed to alter their forms and features, like\nspectres in a feverish dream; their figures became larger, and their\nfaces more disturbed; and, as an excited imagination predominated over\nthe realities which his eyes received, he could have thought himself\nsurrounded rather by a band of demons than of human beings; the walls\nseemed to drop with blood, and the light tick of the clock thrilled on\nhis ear with such loud, painful distinctness, as if each sound were the\nprick of a bodkin inflicted on the naked nerve of the organ.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.[Illustration: Morton Awaiting Death--frontispiece2]\n\n\nIt was with pain that he felt his mind wavering, while on the brink\nbetween this and the future world.He made a strong effort to compose\nhimself to devotional exercises, and unequal, during that fearful strife\nof nature, to arrange his own thoughts into suitable expressions, he had,\ninstinctively, recourse to the petition for deliverance and for composure\nof spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church\nof England.Macbriar, whose family were of that persuasion, instantly\nrecognised the words, which the unfortunate prisoner pronounced half\naloud.\"There lacked but this,\" he said, his pale cheek kindling with\nresentment, \"to root out my carnal reluctance to see his blood spilt.He\nis a prelatist, who has sought the camp under the disguise of an\nErastian, and all, and more than all, that has been said of him must\nneeds be verity.His blood be on his head, the deceiver!--let him go down\nto Tophet, with the ill-mumbled mass which he calls a prayer-book, in his\nright hand!\"\"As the sun went\nback on the dial ten degrees for intimating the recovery of holy\nHezekiah, so shall it now go forward, that the wicked may be taken away\nfrom among the people, and the Covenant established in its purity.\"He sprang to a chair with an attitude of frenzy, in order to anticipate\nthe fatal moment by putting the index forward; and several of the party\nbegan to make ready their slaughter-weapons for immediate execution, when\nMucklewrath's hand was arrested by one of his companions.he said--\"I hear a distant noise.\"\"It is the rushing of the brook over the pebbles,\" said one.\"It is the sough of the wind among the bracken,\" said another.\"It is the galloping of horse,\" said Morton to himself, his sense of\nhearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood; \"God\ngrant they may come as my deliverers!\"The noise approached rapidly, and became more and more distinct.\"It is horse,\" cried Macbriar.\"Look out and descry who they are.\"cried one who had opened the window, in\nobedience to his order.A thick trampling and loud voices were heard immediately round the house.Some rose to resist, and some to escape; the doors and windows were\nforced at once, and the red coats of the troopers appeared in the\napartment.\"Have at the bloody rebels!--Remember Cornet Grahame!\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.The lights were struck down, but the dubious glare of the fire enabled\nthem to continue the fray.Several pistol-shots were fired; the whig who\nstood next to Morton received a shot as he was rising, stumbled against\nthe prisoner, whom he bore down with his weight, and lay stretched above\nhim a dying man.This seemed to amuse Muriel, but still he persisted in further arousing\nthe lads by saying, insinuatingly:\n\n\"I war led ter b'lieve that Kate war ruther interested in you-uns by her\nmanner.Thar don't no maounting gal take so much trouble over strangers\nfer nothin'!\"Frank bit his lip, and Barney looked blacker than ever.It seemed that\nMuriel was trying to draw them into a trap of some sort, and they were\ngrowing suspicious.Had this young leader of mountain ruffians rescued\nthem that he might find just cause or good excuse to put them out of the\nway?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.The boys were silent, and Muriel forced a laugh.\"Wal, ye won't talk about that, an' so we'll go onter somethin' else.I\njudge you-uns know yo're in a po'erful bad scrape?\"exclaimed Barney, feeling of his neck, and\nmaking a wry face, as if troubled by an unpleasant recollection.\"It is a scrape that you-uns may not be able ter git out of easy,\"\nMuriel said.\"I war able ter save yer from bein' hung 'thout any show at\nall, but ye're not much better off now.\"\"If you were powerful enough to save us in the first place, you should\nbe able to get us out of the scrape entirely.\"\"You-uns don't know all about it.Moonshiners have laws an' regulations,\nan' even ther leader must stan' by them.\"Frank was still troubled by the unpleasant suspicion that Muriel was\ntheir enemy, after all that had happened.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.He felt that they must guard\ntheir tongues, for there was no telling what expression the fellow might\ndistort and turn against them.Seeing neither of the lads was going to speak, Muriel went on:\n\n\"Yes, moonshiners have laws and regulations.Ther boys came nigh\nbreakin' one o' ther laws by hangin' you-uns ter-night 'thout givin' ye\na show.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the kitchen.\"Then we are to have a fair deal?\"\"Ez fair ez anybody gits,\" assured Muriel, tossing back a lock of his\ncoal-black hair, which he wore long enough to fall to the collar of his\ncoat.That depends on what kind of a deal it is.\"\"Wall, ye'll be given yore choice.\"If it is proven that we are revenue spies,\nwe'll have to take our medicine.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.But if it is not proven, we demand\nimmediate release.\"\"Take my advice;

ef it is black, it cooks yer, fer it means death.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.The boys were silent, dumfounded, appalled.Muriel stood watching them, and Frank fancied that his eyes were\ngleaming with satisfaction.The boy began to believe he had mistaken the\ncharacter of this astonishing youth; Muriel might be even worse than his\nolder companions, for he might be one who delighted in torturing his\nvictims.Frank threw back his head, defiance and scorn written on his handsome\nface.\"It is a clean case of murder, at best!\"he cried, his voice ringing out\nclearly.\"We deserve a fair trial--we demand it!\"\"Wal,\" drawled the boy moonshiner, \"I warned you-uns that ther more yer\ndemanded, ther less yer got.\"We're in fur it, Frankie, me b'y!\"\"If we had our revolvers, we'd give them a stiff fight for it!\"\"They would not murder us till a few of them had eaten\nlead!\"\"You-uns has stuff, an' when I tell yer that ye'll have ter sta' ter\nvote ur take chances with ther cards, I don't judge you'll hesitate.\"Then, make it the cards,\" said Frank, hoarsely.\"That will give us an\neven show, if the draw is a fair one.\"\"I'll see ter that,\" assured Muriel.Without another word, he turned and swiftly slipped out of the room.They heard him bar the door, and then they stood looking into each\nother's faces, speechless for a few moments.\"It's a toss-up, Barney,\" Frank finally observed.\"Thot's pwhat it is, an' th' woay our luck is runnin' Oi think it's a\ncase av heads they win an' tails we lose.\"\"Pwhat do yez think av thot Muriel?\"\"Worse than thot, me b'y--he's a cat's cradle toied in a hundred an'\nsivintane knots.\"\"It is impossible to tell whether he is friendly or whether he is the\nworst foe we have in these mountains.\"\"Oi wonder how Kate Kenyon knew where to foind him so quick?\"She must have found him in a very short time\nafter we were taken from the cabin.\"\"An' she diskivered thot we hed been taken away moighty soon afther we\nwur gone, me b'y.It may have aroused Kate and her\nmother, and caused them to investigate.\"\"Loikely thot wur th' case, fer it's not mesilf thot would think she'd\nkape shtill an' let ther spalpanes drag us away av she knew it.\"\"No;

will have to submit,\" said Frank, quietly.\"You will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this\nroom,\" said Muriel.The men each held the end of a stout rope, and the boys were forced to\nsubmit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them.Barney protested, but Frank kept silent, knowing it was useless to say\nanything.When their hands were tied, Muriel said:\n\n\"Follow.\"He led the way, while Frank came next, with Barney shuffling sulkily\nalong at his heels.They passed through a dark room and entered another room, which was\nlighted by three oil lamps.The room was well filled with the\nblack-hooded moonshiners, who were standing in a grim and silent\ncircle, with their backs against the walls.Into the center of this circle, the boys were marched.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.The door closed,\nand Muriel addressed the Black Caps.\"It is not often that we-uns gives our captives ther choice uv ther\ncards or ther vote, but we have agreed ter do so in this case, with only\none objectin', an' he war induced ter change his mind.Now we mean ter\nhave this fair an' squar', an' I call on ev'ry man present ter watch out\nan' see that it is.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Ther men has been serlected, one ter hold ther cards\nan' one ter draw.Two of the Black Caps stepped out, and Frank started a bit, for he\nbelieved one of them was Wade Miller.A pack of cards was produced, and Muriel shuffled them with a skill that\ntold of experience, after which he handed them to one of the men.Frank watched every move, determined to detect the fraud if possible,\nshould there be any fraud.An awed hush seemed to settle over the room.The men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little, every one of\nthem watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack.Barney Mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound, and then was\nsilent, standing stiff and straight.Muriel was as alert as a panther, and his eyes gleamed through the holes\nin his mask like twin stars.The man who received the pack from Muriel stepped forward, and Miller\nreached out his hand to draw.That we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this\nmatter, why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards?\"Quick as a flash of light, Muriel's hand fell on the wrist of the man\nwho held the cards, and his clear voice rang out:\n\n\"Stop!Frank's hands were unbound, and he was given the cards.He shuffled\nthem, but he did not handle them with more skill than had Muriel.He\n\"shook them up\" thoroughly, and then passed them back to the man who\nwas to hold them.Muriel's order was swiftly obeyed, and Frank was again helpless.Wade Miller reached out, and quickly made the\ndraw, holding the fateful card up for all to see.From beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word, as the man\nbeheld the black card which was exposed to view.Frank's heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom, but no\nsound came from his lips.Barney Mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve.Indeed, the Irish lad\nlaughed recklessly as he cried:\n\n\"It's nivver a show we had at all, at all, Frankie.Th' snakes had it\nfixed fer us all th' toime.\"The words came from Muriel, and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a\nspring and a grab, snatching the card from Miller's hand.Let's give ther critters a fair\nshow.\"\"Do you mean ter say they didn't have a fair show?\"\"Not knowin' it,\" answered Muriel.\"But ther draw warn't fair, jes' ther\nsame.\"One is ther ace o' spades, an' ther other is ther\nnine o' hearts.\"Exclamations of astonishment came from all sides, and a ray of hope shot\ninto Frank Merriwell's heart.Ther black card war ther one exposed, an' that settles what'll be\ndone with ther spies.\"\"Them boys is goin' ter\nhave a squar' show.\"It was with the greatest difficulty that Miller held himself in check.His hands were clinched, and Frank fancied that he longed to spring upon\nMuriel.The boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand\nof the man who had held them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.\"Release one of the prisoners,\" was his command.Once more Frank's hands were freed, and again the cards were given him\nto shuffle.He mixed them deftly, without saying a word, and gave them\nback to Muriel.Then his hands were tied, and he awaited the second\ndrawing.\"Be careful an' not get two cards this time,\" warned Muriel as he faced\nMiller.\"This draw settles ther business fer them-uns.\"The cards were given to the man who was to hold them, and Miller stepped\nforward to draw.Again the suspense became great, again the men leaned forward to see the\ncard that should be pulled from the pack; again the hearts of the\ncaptives stood still.He seemed to feel that the tide had turned against\nhim.For a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw, and then, with a\nmuttered exclamation, he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to\nview.Then, with a bitter cry of baffled rage, he flung it madly to the\nfloor.Each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath.It was plain that\nsome were disappointed, and some were well satisfied.\"They-uns won't be put out o'\nther way ter-night.\"\"An' I claim that it don't,\" returned the youthful moonshiner, without\nlifting his voice in the least.\"You-uns all agreed ter ther second\ndraw, an' that lets them off.\"\"But\nthem critters ain't out o' ther maountings yit!\"\"By that yer mean--jes' what?\"\"Ef they-uns is killed, I'll know whar ter look fer ther one as war at\nther bottom o' ther job--an' I'll look!\"Muriel did not bluster, and he did not speak above an ordinary tone, but\nit was plain that he meant every word.\"Wal,\" muttered Miller, \"what do ye mean ter do with them critters--turn\n'em out, an' let 'em bring ther officers down on us?\"I'm goin' ter keep 'em till they kin be escorted out o' ther\nmaountings.Thar ain't time ter-night, fer it's gittin' toward mornin'.Ter-morrer night it can be done.\"He seemed to know it was useless to make further\ntalk, but Frank and Barney knew that they were not yet out of danger.The boys seemed as cool as any one in the room, for all of the deadly\nperil they had passed through, and Muriel nodded in a satisfied way when\nhe had looked them over.\"Come,\" he said, in a low tone, \"you-uns will have ter go back ter ther\nroom whar ye war a bit ago.\"They were willing to go back, and it was with no small amount of relief\nthat they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment.Muriel dismissed the two guards, and then he set the hands of the boys\nfree.It seemed that you had saved us from being\nhanged, but that you intended to finish us here.\"\"Ef that war my scheme, why did I take ther trouble ter save ye at all?\"\"It looked as if you did so to please Miss Kenyon.You had saved us, and\nthen, if the men disposed of us in the regular manner, you would not be\nto blame.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.Muriel shook back his long, black hair, and his manner showed that he\nwas angry.He did not feel at all pleased to know his sincerity had been\ndoubted.\"Wal,\" he said, slowly, \"ef it hadn't been fer me you-uns would be gone\n<DW53>s now.\"\"You-uns know I saved ye, but ye don't know how I done it.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.There was something of bitterness and reproach in the voice of the\nyouthful moonshiner.He continued:\n\n\"I done that fer you I never done before fer no man.I wouldn't a done\nit fer myself!\"\"Do you-uns want ter know what I done?\"\"When I snatched ther first card drawn from ther hand o' ther man what\ndrawed it.It war ther ace o' spades, an' it condemned yer ter die.\"Thar war one card drawed, an' that war all!\"\"That war whar I cheated,\" he said, simply.\"I had ther red card in my\nhand ready ter do ther trick ef a black card war drawed.In that way I\nknowed I could give yer two shows ter escape death.\"The boys were astounded by this revelation, but they did not doubt that\nMuriel spoke the truth.His manner showed that he was not telling a\nfalsehood.And this strange boy--this remarkable leader of moonshiners--had done\nsuch a thing to save them!More than ever, they marveled at the fellow.Once more Muriel's arms were folded over his breast, and he was leaning\ngracefully against the door, his eyes watching their faces.For several moments both boys were stricken dumb with wonder and\nsurprise.Frank was not a little confused, thinking as he did how he had\nmisunderstood this mysterious youth.It seemed most unaccountable that he should do such a thing for two\nlads who were utter strangers to him.A sound like a bitter laugh came from behind the sable mask, and Muriel\nflung out one hand, with an impatient gesture.\"I know what you-uns is thinkin' of,\" declared the young moonshiner.\"Ye\nwonder why I done so.Wal, I don't jes' know myself, but I promised Kate\nter do my best fer ye.\"cried Frank, \"kept it nobly!Muriel, you\nmay be a moonshiner, you may be the leader of the Black Caps, but I am\nproud to know you!I believe you are white all the way through!\"exclaimed the youth, with a show of satisfaction, \"that makes me\nfeel better.But it war Kate as done it, an' she's ther one ter thank;\nbut it ain't likely you-uns'll ever see her ag'in.\"\"Then, tell her,\" said Frank, swiftly, \"tell her for us that we are very\nthankful--tell her we shall not forget her.He seemed about to speak, and then checked\nhimself.\"I'll tell her,\" nodded Muriel, his voice sounding a bit strange.\"Is\nthat all you-uns want me ter tell her?\"\"Tell her I would give much to see her again,\" came swiftly from Frank's\nlips.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.\"She's promised to be my friend, and right well has she kept that\npromise.\"\"Then I'll have ter leave you-uns now.Breakfast will be brought ter ye, and when another night comes, a guard\nwill go with yer out o' ther maountings.He held out a hand, and Muriel seemed to hesitate.After a few moments,\nthe masked lad shook his head, and, without another word, left the room.cried Barney, scratching his head, \"thot felly is worse than\nOi thought!Oi don't know so much about him now as Oi did bafore Oi met\nhim at all, at all!\"They made themselves as\ncomfortable as possible, and talked over the thrilling events of the\nnight.\"If Kate Kenyon had not told me that her brother was serving time as a\nconvict, I should think this Muriel must be her brother,\" said Frank.\"Av he's not her brither, it's badly shtuck on her he must be, Oi\ndunno,\" observed Barney.\"An' av he be shtuck on her, pwhoy don't he git\nonter th' collar av thot Miller?\"Finally, when they had tired\nof talking, the boys lay down and tried to sleep.Frank was beginning to doze when his ears seemed to detect a slight\nrustling in that very room, and his eyes flew open in a twinkling.He\nstarted up, a cry of wonder surging to his lips, and being smothered\nthere.Kate Kenyon stood within ten feet of him!As Frank started up, the girl swiftly placed a finger on her lips,\nwarning him to be silent.Frank sprang to his feet, and Barney Mulloy sat up, rubbing his eyes and\nbeginning to speak.\"Pwhat's th' matter now, me b'y?Barney clasped both hands over his mouth, having caught the warning\ngestures from Frank and the girl.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.Still the exclamation had escaped his\nlips, although it was not uttered loudly.Swiftly Kate Kenyon flitted across the room, listening with her ear to\nthe door to hear any sound beyond.After some moments, she seemed\nsatisfied that the moonshiners had not been aroused by anything that had\nhappened within that room, and she came back, standing close to Frank,\nand whispering:\n\n\"Ef you-uns will trust me, I judge I kin git yer out o' this scrape.\"exclaimed Frank, softly, as he caught her hand.\"We have\nyou to thank for our lives!Kate--your pardon!--Miss Kenyon, how can we\never repay you?\"\"Don't stop ter talk 'bout that now,\" she said, with chilling\nroughness.\"Ef you-uns want ter live, an' yer want ter git erway frum\nWade Miller, git reddy ter foller me.\"She silently pointed to a dark opening in the corner, and they saw that\na small trapdoor was standing open.\"We kin git out that way,\" she said.The boys wondered why they had not discovered the door when they\nexamined the place, but there was no time for investigation.Kate Kenyon flitted lightly toward the opening.Pausing beside it, she\npointed downward, saying:\n\n\"Go ahead; I'll foller and close ther door.\"The boys did not hesitate, for they placed perfect confidence in the\ngirl now.Barney dropped down in advance, and his feet found some rude\nstone steps.In a moment he had disappeared, and then Frank followed.As lightly as a fairy, Kate Kenyon dropped through the opening, closing\nthe door behind her.The boys found themselves in absolute darkness, in some sort of a\nnarrow, underground place, and there they paused, awaiting their guide.Her hand touched Frank as she slipped past, and he\ncaught the perfume of wild flowers.To him she was like a beautiful wild\nflower growing in a wilderness of weeds.The boys heard the word, and they moved slowly forward through the\ndarkness, now and then feeling dank walls on either hand.For a considerable distance they went on in this way, and then the\npassage seemed to widen out, and they felt that they had entered a cave.\"Keep close ter me,\" directed the girl.Now you-uns can't git astray.\"At last a strange smell came to their nostrils, seemingly on the wings\nof a light breath of air.\"Ther mill whar ther moonshine is made.\"Never for a moment did she\nhesitate; she seemed to have the eyes of an owl.All at once they heard the sound of gently running water.\"Lost Creek runs through har,\" answered the girl.So the mysterious stream flowed through this cavern, and the cave was\nnear one of the illicit distilleries.Frank cared to know no more, for he did not believe it was healthy to\nknow too much about the makers of moonshine.It was not long before they approached the mouth of the cave.They saw\nthe opening before them, and then, of a sudden, a dark figure arose\nthere--the figure of a man with a gun in his hands!Kate uttered the words, and the boys began to recover from their alarm,\nas she did not hesitate in the least.I put him thar ter watch\nout while I war in hyar.\"Of a sudden, Kate struck a match, holding it so the\nlight shone on her face, and the figure at the mouth of the cave was\nseen to wave its hand and vanish.\"Ther", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "\"But it's gittin' right nigh\nmornin', an' we-uns must hustle away from hyar afore it is light.The boys were well satisfied to get away as quickly as possible.They passed out of the dark cavern into the cool, sweet air of a spring\nmorning, for the gray of dawn was beginning to dispel the darkness, and\nthe birds were twittering from the thickets.The phantom of a moon was in the sky, hanging low down and half-inverted\nas if spilling a spectral glamour over the ghostly mists which lay deep\nin Lost Creek Valley.The sweet breath of flowers and of the woods was in the morning air, and\nfrom some cabin afar on the side of a distant mountain a wakeful\nwatchdog barked till the crags reverberated with his clamoring.\"Thar's somethin' stirrin' at 'Bize Wiley's, ur his dorg wouldn't be\nkickin' up all that racket,\" observed Kate Kenyon.\"He lives by ther\nroad that comes over from Bildow's Crossroads.Folks comin' inter ther\nmaountings from down below travel that way.\"The boys looked around for the mute who had been guarding the mouth of\nthe cave, but they saw nothing of him.He had slipped away into the\nbushes which grew thick all around the opening.\"Come on,\" said the girl, after seeming strangely interested in the\nbarking of the dog.\"We'll git ter ther old mill as soon as we kin.Foller me, an' be ready ter scrouch ther instant anything is seen.\"Now that they could see her, she led them forward at a swift pace, which\nastonished them both.She did not run, but she seemed to skim over the\nground, and she took advantage of every bit of cover till they entered\nsome deep, lowland pines.Through this strip of woods she swiftly led them, and they came near to\nLost Creek, where it flowed down in the dismal valley.There they found the ruins of an old mill, the moss-covered water-wheel\nforever silent, the roof sagging and falling in, the windows broken out\nby mischievous boys, the whole presenting a most melancholy and deserted\nappearance.The road that had led to the mill from the main highway was overgrown\nwith weeds.Later it would be filled with thistles and burdocks.Wild\nsassafras grew along the roadside.\"That's whar you-uns must hide ter-day,\" said Kate, motioning toward the\nmill.\"We are not criminals, nor are we\nrevenue spies.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.I do not fancy the idea of hiding like a hunted dog.\"\"It's better ter be a live dorg than a dead lion.Ef you-uns'll take my\nadvice, you'll come inter ther mill thar, an' ye'll keep thar all day,\nan' keep mighty quiet.I know ye're nervy, but thar ain't no good in\nbein' foolish.It'll be known that you-uns have escaped, an' then Wade\nMiller will scour ther country.Ef he come on yer----\"\n\n\"Give us our arms, and we'll be ready to meet Mr.\"But yer wouldn't meet him alone; thar'd be others with him, an' you-uns\nwouldn't have no sorter show.\"Kate finally succeeded in convincing the boys that she spoke the truth,\nand they agreed to remain quietly in the old mill.She led them into the mill, which was dank and dismal.The imperfect\nlight failed to show all the pitfalls that lurked for their feet, but\nshe warned them, and they escaped injury.The miller had lived in the mill, and the girl took them to the part of\nthe old building that had served as a home.\"Har,\" she said, opening a closet door, \"I've brung food fer you-uns, so\nyer won't starve, an' I knowed ye'd be hongry.\"\"You are more than thoughtful, Miss Kenyon.\"\"Yer seem ter have fergot what we agreed ter call each other, Frank.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.She spoke the words in a tone of reproach.Barney turned away, winking uselessly at nothing at all, and kept his\nback toward them for some moments.But Frank Merriwell had no thought of making love to this strange girl\nof the mountains.She had promised to be his friend; she had proved\nherself his friend, and as no more than a friend did he propose to\naccept her.That he had awakened something stronger than a friendly feeling in Kate\nKenyon's breast seemed evident, and the girl was so artless that she\ncould not conceal her true feelings toward him.They stood there, talking in a low tone, while the morning light stole\nin at one broken window and grew stronger and stronger within that room.As he did so a new thought\ncame to him--a thought that was at first a mere suspicion, which he\nscarcely noted at all.This suspicion grew, and he found himself asking:\n\n\"Kate, are you sure your brother is still wearing a convict's suit?\"\"You do not know that he is dead--you have not heard of his death?\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.Her eyes flashed, and a look of pride swept across her face.\"Folks allus 'lowed Rufe Kenyon wa'n't afeard o' ary two-legged critter\nlivin', an' they war right.\"She clutched his arm, beginning to pant, as she asked:\n\n\"What makes you say that?I knowed he'd try it some day, but--but, have\nyou heard anything?The suspicion leaped to a conviction in the twinkling of an eye.If Rufe\nKenyon was not at liberty, then he must be right in what he thought.\"I do not know that your brother has tried to escape.I did think that he might be Muriel, the\nmoonshiner.\"\"You-uns war plumb mistooken thar,\" she said, positively.\"Rufe is not\nMuriel.\"\"Then,\" cried Frank, \"you are Muriel yourself!\"\"Have you-uns gone plumb dafty?\"asked the girl, in a dazed way.\"But you are--I am sure of it,\" said Frank, swiftly.Of course I'm not Muriel; but he's ther best\nfriend I've got in these maountings.\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.Frank was far from satisfied, but he was too courteous to insist after\nthis denial.Kate laughed the idea to scorn, saying over and over that\nthe boy must be \"dafty,\" but still his mind was unchanged.To be sure, there were some things not easily explained, one being how\nMuriel concealed her luxurious red hair, for Muriel's hair appeared to\nbe coal-black.Another thing was that Wade Miller must know Muriel and Kate were one\nand the same, and yet he preserved her secret and allowed her to snatch\nhis victims from his maws.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Barney Mulloy had been more than astounded by Frank's words; the Irish\nyouth was struck dumb.When he could collect himself, he softly\nmuttered:\n\n\"Well, av all th' oideas thot takes th' cake!\"Having seen them safely within the mill and shown them the food brought\nthere, Kate said:\n\n\"Har is two revolvers fer you-uns.Don't use 'em unless yer have ter,\nbut shoot ter kill ef you're forced.\"Oi'm ready fer th' spalpanes!\"cried Barney, as he grasped one\nof the weapons.\"Next time Wade Miller and his\ngang will not catch us napping.\"\"Roight, me b'y; we'll be sound awake, Frankie.\"Kate bade them good-by, assuring them that she would return with the\ncoming of another night, and making them promise to await her, and then\nshe flitted away, slipped out of the mill, soon vanishing amid the\npines.\"It's dead lucky we are ter be living, Frankie,\" observed Barney.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.\"I quite agree with you,\" laughed Merriwell.\"This night has been a\nblack and tempestuous one, but we have lived through it, and I do not\nbelieve we'll find ourselves in such peril again while we are in the\nTennessee mountains.\"They were hungry, and they ate heartily of the plain food that had been\nprovided for them.When breakfast was over, Barney said:\n\n\"Frankie, it's off yer trolley ye git sometoimes.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.Oi wur thinkin' av pwhat yez said about Kate Kenyon being\nMooriel, th' moonshoiner.\"\"I was not off my trolley so very much then.\"\"You think so, but I have made a study of Muriel and of Kate Kenyon.I\nam still inclined to believe the moonshiner is the girl in disguise.\"\"An' Oi say ye're crazy.No girrul could iver do pwhat thot felly does,\nan' no band av min loike th' moonshoiners would iver allow a girrul\nloike Kate Kenyon ter boss

I shall not give it up yet.\"\"Whoy, think pwhat a divvil thot Muriel is!An' th' color av his hair is\nblack, whoile the girrul's is red.\"\"I have thought of those things, and I have wondered how she concealed\nthat mass of red hair; still I am satisfied she does it.\"\"Well, it's no use to talk to you at all, at all.\"However, they did discuss it for some time.Finally they fell to exploring the old mill, and they wandered from one\npart to another till they finally came to the place where they had\nentered over a sagging plank.They were standing there, just within the\ndeeper shadow of the mill, when a man came panting and reeling from the\nwoods, his hat off, his shirt torn open at the throat, great drops of\nperspiration standing on his face, a wild, hunted look in his eyes, and\ndashed to the end of the plank that led over the water into the old\nmill.Frank clutched Barney, and the boys fell back a step, watching the man,\nwho was looking back over his shoulder and listening, the perfect\npicture of a hunted thing.came in a hoarse pant from the\nman's lips.\"But I turned on 'em--I doubled--an' I hope I fooled 'em.It's my last chance, fer I'm dead played, and I'm so nigh starved that\nit's all I kin do ter drag one foot arter t'other.\"He listened again, and then, as if overcome by a sudden fear of being\nseen there, he suddenly rushed across the plank and plunged into the\nmill.In the twinkling of an eye man and boy were clasped in a close embrace,\nstruggling desperately.He tried to hurl Frank to the floor, and he would have succeeded had he\nbeen in his normal condition, for he was a man of great natural\nstrength; but he was exhausted by flight and hunger, and, in his\nweakened condition, the man found his supple antagonist too much for\nhim.I love to gaze\n            Upon your gorgeous hues and varying forms,\n            When lighted with the sun of noon-day\u2019s blaze,\n            Or when ye are darkened with the blackest storms.Next, consider this rather morbidly religious effusion in blank verse:\n\n       I see thee reaching forth thy hand to take\n       The laurel wreath that Fame has twined and now\n       Offers to thee, if thou wilt but bow down\n       And worship at her feet and bring to her\n       The goodly offerings of thy soul.I see\n       Thee grasp the iron pen to write thy name\n       In everlasting characters upon\n       The gate of Fame\u2019s fair dome.Ah, take not yet the wreath of Fame, lest thou\n       Be satisfied with its false glittering\n       And fail to win a brighter, fairer crown,\u2014\n       Such crown as Fame\u2019s skilled fingers ne\u2019er have learned\n       To fashion, e\u2019en a crown of Life.And bring\n       Thy offerings, the first, the best, and place\n       Them on God\u2019s altar, and for incense sweet\n       Give Him the freshness of thy youth.And thus\n       Thou mayest gain a never fading crown.And wait not now to trace thy name upon\n       The catalogue of Fame\u2019s immortal ones, but haste thee first\n       To have it writ in Heaven in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life.Pardon this seeming betrayal of a rustic poetess.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.For it seems like\nbetrayal to quote such lines, when she produced much better ones.For\nexample, the following verses are, to my mind, true and rather good\npoetry:\n\n                   I have not known thee long friend,\n                   Yet I remember thee;\n                   Aye deep within my heart of hearts\n                   Shall live thy memory.And I would ask of thee friend\n                   That thou wouldst think of me.There are ten thousand cords\n          Which bind my soul to life, ten thousand sweets\n          Mixed with the bitter of existence\u2019 cup\n          Which make me love to quaff its mingled wine.There are sweet looks and tones through all the earth\n          That win my heart.Love-looks are in the lily\u2019s bell\n          And violet\u2019s eye, and love-tones on the winds\n          And waters.There are forms of grace which all\n          The while are gliding by, enrapturing\n          My vision.O, I can not guess how one\n          Can weary of the earth, when ev\u2019ry year\n          To me it seems more and more beautiful;\n          When each succeeding spring the flowers wear\n          A fairer hue, and ev\u2019ry autumn on\n          The forest top are richer tints.When each\n          Succeeding day the sunlight brighter seems,\n          And ev\u2019ry night a fairer beauty shines\n          From all the stars....\n\nLikewise, this rather melancholy effusion, entitled \u201cWaiting\u201d:\n\n                Love, sweet Love, I\u2019m waiting for thee,\n                And my heart is wildly beating\n                At the joyous thought of meeting\n                With its kindred heart so dear.Love, _now_ I am waiting for thee._Soon_ I shall not wait

  Not upon Time\u2019s barren shore,\n                For I see my cheek is paling,\n                And I feel my strength is failing.Love, I shall not wait here for thee.When I ope the golden door\n

afterwards astronomer, came of excellent\nfamily.He was descended from John Hall, of Wallingford, Conn., who\nserved in the Pequot War.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.The same John Hall was the progenitor of Lyman\nHall, signer of the Declaration of Independence and Governor of Georgia.The carpenter\u2019s great-grandfather, David Hall, an original proprietor of\nGoshen, Conn., was killed in battle near Lake George on that fatal 8th\nof September, 1755.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.[1] His grandfather, Asaph Hall 1st, saw service in\nthe Revolution as captain of Connecticut militia.This Asaph and his\nsister Alice went from Wallingford about 1755, to become Hall pioneers\nin Goshen, Conn., where they lived in a log house.Alice married; Asaph\nprospered, and in 1767 built himself a large house.He was a friend of\nEthan Allen, was with him at the capture of Ticonderoga, and was one of\nthe chief patriots of Goshen.He saw active service as a soldier, served\ntwenty-four times in the State legislature, and was a member of the\nState convention called to ratify the Federal Constitution.Hall Meadow,\na fertile valley in the town of Goshen, still commemorates his", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "He\naccumulated considerable property, so that his only child, the second\nAsaph Hall, born in 1800 a few months after his death, was brought up a\nyoung gentleman, and fitted to enter Yale College.But the mother\nrefused to be separated from her son, and before he became of age she\nset him up in business.His inheritance rapidly slipped away; and in\n1842 he died in Georgia, where he was selling clocks, manufactured in\nhis Goshen factory.Footnote 1:\n\n  _See Wallingford Land Records, vol.541._\n\nAsaph Hall 3rd, born October 15, 1829, was the eldest of six children.His early boyhood was spent in easy circumstances, and he early acquired\na taste for good literature.But at thirteen he was called upon to help\nhis mother rescue the wreckage of his father\u2019s property.Fortunately,\nthe Widow, Hannah (Palmer) Hall, was a woman of sterling character, a\ndaughter of Robert Palmer, first of Stonington, then of Goshen, Conn.To\nher Asaph Hall 3rd owed in large measure his splendid physique; and who\ncan say whether his mental powers were inherited from father or mother?For three years the widow and her children struggled to redeem a\nmortgaged farm.During one of these years they made and sold ten\nthousand pounds of cheese, at six cents a pound.It was a losing fight,\nso the widow retired to a farm free from mortgage, and young Asaph, now\nsixteen, was apprenticed to Herrick and Dunbar, carpenters.He served an\napprenticeship of three years, receiving his board and five dollars a\nmonth.During his first year as a journeyman he earned twenty-two\ndollars a month and board; and as he was still under age he gave one\nhundred dollars of his savings to his mother.Her house was always home\nto him; and when cold weather put a stop to carpentry, he returned\nthither to help tend cattle or to hunt gray squirrels.For the young\ncarpenter was fond of hunting.One winter he studied geometry and algebra with a Mr.Rice, principal of\nthe Norfolk Academy.But he found he was a better mathematician than his\nteacher.Indeed, he had hardly begun his studies at McGrawville when he\ndistinguished himself by solving a problem which up to that time had\nbaffled students and teachers alike.Massachusetts educators would have us believe that a young man of\ntwenty-five should have spent nine years in primary and grammar schools,\nfour years more in a high school, four years more at college, and three\nyears more in some professional school.Supposing the victim to have\nbegun his career in a kindergarten at the age of three, and to have\npursued a two-years\u2019 course there, at twenty-five his education would be\ncompleted.He would have finished his education, provided his education\nhad not finished him.Now at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five Asaph Hall 3rd only began\nserious study.He brought to his tasks the vigor of an unspoiled youth,\nspent in the open air.He worked as only a man of mature strength can\nwork, and he comprehended as only a man of keen, undulled intellect can\ncomprehend.His ability as a scholar called forth the admiration of\nfellow-students and the encouragement of teachers.The astronomer\nBr\u00fcnnow, buried in the wilds of Michigan, far from his beloved Germany,\nrecognized in this American youth a worthy disciple, and Dr.Benjamin\nApthorp Gould, father of American astronomy, promptly adopted Asaph Hall\ninto his scientific family.If our young American\u2019s experience puts conventional theories of\neducation to the blush, much more does his manhood reflect upon the\ntheory that unites intellectuality with personal impurity.The historian\nLecky throws a glamor over the loathesomeness of what is politely known\nas the social evil, and calls the prostitute a modern priestess.And it\nis well known that German university students of these degenerate days\nconsider continence an absurdity.Asaph Hall was as pure as Sir\nGallahad, who sang:\n\n                My good blade carves the casques of men,\n                My tough lance thrusteth sure,\n                My strength is as the strength of ten,\n                Because my heart is pure.Let it be conceded that this untutored American youth had had an\nexcellent course in manual training\u2014anticipating the modern fad in\neducation by half a century.However, he had never belonged to an Arts\nand Crafts Movement, and had never made dinky little what-nots or other\nuseless and fancy articles.He had spent eight years at carpenter work;\nthree years as an apprentice and five years as a journeyman, and he was\na skilful and conscientious workman.He handled his tools as only\ncarpenters of his day and generation were used to handle them, making\ndoors, blinds, and window-sashes, as well as hewing timbers for the\nframes of houses.Monuments of his handiwork, in the shape of well-built\nhouses, are to be seen in Connecticut and Massachusetts to this day.Like other young men of ability, he was becomingly modest, and his boss,\nold Peter Bogart, used to say with a twinkle in his eye, that of all the\nmen in his employ, Asaph Hall was the only one who didn\u2019t know more than\nPeter Bogart.And yet it was Asaph Hall who showed his fellow carpenters how to\nconstruct the roof of a house scientifically.\u201cCut and try\u201d was their\nrule; and if the end of a joist was spoilt by too frequent application\nof the rule, they took another joist.But the young carpenter knew the\nthing could be done right the first time; and so, without the aid of\ntext-book or instructor, he worked the problem out, by the principles of\nprojection.The timbers sawed according to his directions fitted\nperfectly, and his companions marveled.To himself the incident meant much, for he had proved himself more than\na carpenter.His ambition was aroused, and he resolved to become an\narchitect.But a kindly Providence led him on to a still nobler calling.In 1854 he set out for McGrawville thinking that by the system of manual\nlabor there advertised he could earn his way as he studied.When the\nstage rolled into town, whom should he see but Angeline Stickney,\ndressed in her \u201cbloomer\u201d costume!\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                        COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.President Eliot of Harvard University is quoted as saying that marriage\nought to unite two persons of the same religious faith: otherwise it is\nlikely to prove unhappy.President Eliot has said many wise things, but\nthis is not one of them\u2014unless he is shrewdly seeking to produce\nbachelors and spinsters to upbuild his university.One of Angeline\nStickney\u2019s girl friends had a suitor of the Universalist denomination,\nand a very fine man he was; but the girl and her mother belonged to the\nBaptist denomination, which was the denomination of another suitor, whom\nshe married for denominational reasons.Abbreviating the word, her\nexperience proves the following principle: If a young woman belonging to\nthe Baptist demnition rejects an eligible suitor because he belongs to\nthe Universalist demnition, she is likely to go to the demnition\nbow-wows.For religious tolerance even in matrimony there is the best of reasons:\nWe are Protestants before we are Baptists or Universalists, Christians\nbefore we are Catholics or Protestants, moralists before we are Jews or\nChristians, theists before we are Mohammedans or Jews, and human before\nevery thing else.Angeline Stickney, like her girl friend, was a sincere Baptist.Had\njoined the church at the age of sixteen.One of her classmates, a person\nof deeply religious feeling like herself, was a suitor for her hand.But\nshe married Asaph Hall, who was outside the pale of any religious sect,\ndisbelieved in woman-suffrage, wasted little sympathy on <DW64>s, and\nplayed cards!And her marriage was infinitely more fortunate than her\nfriend\u2019s.To be sure she labored to convert her splendid Pagan, and\npartially succeeded; but in the end he converted her, till the Unitarian\nchurch itself was too narrow for her.Cupid\u2019s ways are strange, and sometimes whimsical.There was once a\nyoung man who made fun of a red-haired woman and used to say to his\ncompanions, \u201cGet ready, get ready,\u201d till Reddy got him!No doubt the\nlittle god scored a point when Asaph Hall saw Angeline Stickney solemnly\nparading in the \u201cbloomer\u201d costume.Good humor was one of the young man\u2019s\ncharacteristics, and no doubt he had a hearty laugh at the young lady\u2019s\nexpense.But Dan Cupid contrived to have him pursue a course in geometry\ntaught by Miss Stickney; and, to make it all the merrier, entangled him\nin a plot to down the teacher by asking hard questions.The teacher did\nnot down, admiration took the place of mischief, and Cupid smiled upon a\npair of happy lovers.The love-scenes, the tender greetings and affectionate farewells, the\nardent avowals and gracious answers\u2014all these things, so essential to\nthe modern novel, are known only in heaven.The lovers have lived their\nlives and passed away.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.Some words of endearment are preserved in their\nold letters\u2014but these, gentle reader, are none of your business.However, I may state with propriety a few facts in regard to Angeline\nStickney\u2019s courtship and marriage.It was characteristic of her that\nbefore she became engaged to marry she told Asaph Hall all about her\nfather.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.He, wise lover, could distinguish between sins of the stomach\nand sins of the heart, and risked the hereditary taint pertaining to the\nformer\u2014and this although she emphasized the danger by breaking down and\nbecoming a pitiable invalid.Just before her graduation she wrote:\n\n    I believe God sent you to love me just at this time, that I might\n    not get discouraged.How very good and beautiful you seemed to me that Saturday night\n    that I was sick at Mr.Porter\u2019s, and you still seem just the same.I\n    hope I may sometime repay you for all your kindness and love to me.If I have already brightened your hopes and added to your joy I am\n    thankful.I hope we may always be a blessing to each other and to\n    all around us; and that the great object of our lives may be the\n    good that we can do.There are a great many things I wish to say to\n    you, but I will not try to write them now.I hope I shall see you\n    again soon, and then I can tell you all with my own lips.Do not\n    study too hard, Love, and give yourself rest and sleep as much as\n    you need.Yours truly,\n\n                A. HALL.C. A. S.\n\nAfter her graduation, Mr.Hall accompanied her to Rodman, where he\nvisited her people a week or ten days\u2014a procedure always attended with\ndanger to Dan Cupid\u2019s plans.In this case, it is said the young\ncarpenter was charmed with the buxom sister Ruth, who was, in fact, a\nmuch more marriageable woman than Angeline.But he went about to get the\nengagement ring, which, in spite of a Puritanical protest against such\nadornment, was faithfully worn for twenty years.At last the busy\nhousewife burned her fingers badly washing lamp-chimneys with carbolic\nacid, and her astronomer husband filed asunder the slender band of gold.That the Puritan maiden disdained the feminine display by which less\nmanly lovers are ensnared is illustrated by the following extract from a\nletter to Mr.Hall:\n\n    Last week Wednesday I went to Saratoga.Staid there till the\n    afternoon of the next day.Antoinette L. Brown, Lucy Stone Blackwell,\n    Ernestine Rose, Samuel J. May, and T. W. Higginson.The streets of Saratoga were thronged with fashionables.I never saw\n    before such a display of dress.Poor gilded butterflies, no object\n    in life but to make a display of their fine colors.I could not help\n    contrasting those ladies of fashion with the earnest, noble, working\n    women who stood up there in that Convention, and with words of\n    eloquence urged upon their sisters the importance of awaking to\n    usefulness.This letter was written in August, 1855, when Angeline Stickney was\nvisiting friends and relatives in quest of health.In the same letter\nshe sent directions for Mr.Hall to meet her in Albany on his way to\nMcGrawville; but for some reason he failed her, although he passed\nthrough the city while she was there.This was a grievous\ndisappointment, of which she used to speak in after years.But in a few days they were together at McGrawville, where she remained\nten weeks\u2014visiting friends, of course.November 13 she set out for\nWisconsin, hoping to find employment as a teacher near her sister\nCharlotte Ingalls.At depots and\nhotels, during the journey westward, she thought of the absent lover,\nand sent him long messages.In one letter she said:\n\n    One night I dreamed you had gone away somewhere, without letting any\n    one know where, and I tried to find where you had gone but could\n    not.When I awoke it still\n    seemed a reality.... You must be a good boy and not go away where I\n    shall not know where you are.... It makes my heart ache to think\n    what a long weary way it is from Wisconsin to McGrawville.In the same letter she speaks about lengthening a poem, so that the time\noccupied in reading it was about twenty minutes.Hall rather discouraged his wife\u2019s inclination to write verses.Is it\npossible that he flattered her before marriage?If so, it was no more\nthan her other admirers did.Again, in the same letter, she pleads for the cultivation of religion:\n\n    Did you go to the prayer-meeting last evening?It seemed to me that\n    you were there.If you do not wish to go alone I am sure Mr.You must take some time, Love, to think of the\n    life beyond the grave.You must not be so much engaged in your\n    studies that you cannot have time to think about it and prepare for\n    it.About the middle of December she had reached Elkhorn, Wisconsin, where\nshe remained a fortnight with Elder Bright, her old pastor.Then she\nwent to her sister Charlotte\u2019s, at Milford.In one of her letters from\nthis place she speaks of going surveying.It seems the surveyor of the\nneighborhood was surprised to find a woman who understood his business.In the latter part of December, Asaph Hall returned to Goshen, Conn.Hence the following letter:\n\n                                                GOSHEN, Jan.DEAREST ANGIE:... I think of you a great deal, Angie, and sometimes\n    when I feel how much better and holier you are than I am, I think\n    that I ought to go through with much trial and affliction before I\n    shall be fitted for your companion.In this way I presume that my\n    letters have been shaded by my occasional sad thoughts.But Angie\n    you _must not_ let them affect you any more, or cherish gloomy\n    thoughts about me.I would not drive the color from your cheek or\n    give you one bad thought concerning me for the world.I want, very\n    much, to see you look healthy and strong when I meet you.... Every\n    time I go away from home, among strangers, I feel my need of you.My\n    friends here, even my sisters, seem cold and distant when compared\n    with you.O there is no one like the dear one who nestles in our\n    hearts, and loves us always.My mother loves me, and is very dear to\n    me, and my sisters too, but then they have so many other things to\n    think about that their sympathies are drawn towards other objects.I\n    must have you, Angie, to love me, and we will find a good happy home\n    somewhere, never fear.And now you must be cheerful and hopeful, try\n    to get rid of your headaches, and healthy as fast as you can....

and yet\ntradition says the young carpenter hesitated to marry; and for a brief\nseason Angeline Stickney remembered tearfully that other McGrawville\nsuitor who loved her well, but whose bashful love was too tardy to\nforestall the straightforward Mr.\u201cThe course of true love never\ndid run smooth.\u201d In this case, the trouble seems to have been the lady\u2019s\nfeeble health.When they were married she was very weak, and it looked\nas if she could not live more than two or three years.But her mental\npowers were exceptionally strong, and she remembered tenaciously for\nmany a year the seeming wrong.However, under date of April 2, 1856, Angeline wrote to her sister Mary,\nfrom Ann Arbor, Michigan:\n\n    Mr.Hall and I went to Elder Bright\u2019s and staid over Sunday.We were\n    married Monday morning, and started for this place in the afternoon.Hall came here for the purpose of pursuing his studies.Shall remain here during the summer term,\n    and perhaps three or four years.And so Asaph Hall studied astronomy under the famous Br\u00fcnnow, and French\nunder Fasquelle.And he used to carry his frail wife on his back across\nthe fields to hunt wild flowers.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                      ANN ARBOR AND SHALERSVILLE.Christopher, the strong man who\nserved his masters well, but was dissatisfied in their service until he\nheard of the Lord and Master Jesus Christ?\u2014how he then served gladly at\na ford, carrying pilgrims across on his back\u2014how one day a little child\nasked to be carried across, and perching on his broad shoulders grew\nheavier and heavier till the strong man nearly sank beneath the weight?But he struggled manfully over the treacherous stones, and with a\nsupreme effort bore his charge safely through the waters.And behold,\nthe little child was Christ himself!I think of that legend when I think of the poor ambitious scholar,\nliterally saddled by his invalid wife.For three years he hardly kept\nhis head above water.At one time he thought he could go no further, and\nproposed that she stay with his mother while he gained a better footing.But she pleaded hard, and he struggled through, to receive the reward of\nduty nobly done.But in that time Asaph\nHall had made so favorable an impression that Professor Br\u00fcnnow urged\nhim to continue his studies, and arranged matters so that he might\nattend college at Ann Arbor as long as he chose without paying tuition\nfees.Angeline made plans for her sister Ruth and husband to move to\nMichigan, where Asaph could build them a house.They went southward into Ohio,\nwhere they spent a month with Angeline\u2019s Aunt Achsah Taylor, her\nmother\u2019s sister.You may be sure they earned their board, Angeline in\nthe house and Asaph in the hayfield.Uncle Taylor was a queer old\nfellow, shedding tears when his hay got wet, and going off to the hotel\nfor dinner when his wife happened to give him the wrong end of a fish.August 6, 1856, they arrived at Shalersville, Ohio, where they had\nengaged to teach at the Shalersville Institute.Here they remained till\nabout May 1 of the next year, when Angeline returned to Rodman with\nfunds enough to pay with interest the money borrowed from her cousin\nJoseph Downs; and Asaph proceeded to Cambridge, Mass., where the\ndirector of the Harvard Observatory was in need of an assistant.Let it not be inferred that teaching at Shalersville was financially\nprofitable.Asaph Hall concluded that he preferred carpentry.And yet,\nin the best sense they were most successful\u2014things went smoothly\u2014their\npupils, some of them school teachers, were apt\u2014and they were well liked\nby the people of Shalersville.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Indeed, to induce them to keep school the\nlast term the townspeople presented them with a purse of sixty dollars\nto eke out their income.Asaph Hall turned his mechanical skill to use\nby making a prism, a three-sided receptacle of glass filled with water.Saturdays he held a sort of smoke-talk for the boys\u2014the smoke feature\nabsent\u2014and at least one country boy was inspired to step up higher.The little wife was proud of her manly husband, as the following passage\nfrom a letter to her sister Ruth shows:\n\n    He is real good, and we are very happy.He is a real noble, true man\n    besides being an extra scholar, so you must never be concerned about\n    my not being happy with him.He will take just the best care of me\n    that he possibly can.It appears also that she was converting her husband to the profession of\nreligion.Before he left Ohio he actually united with the Campbellites,\nand was baptized.In the letter just quoted Angeline says:\n\n    We have been reading some of the strongest arguments against the\n    Christian religion, also several authors who support religion, and\n    he has come to the conclusion that all the argument is on the side\n    of Christianity.When he was threatened with\na severe fever, she wrapped him up in hot, wet blankets, and succeeded\nin throwing the poison off through the pores of the skin.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.So they\ncherished each other in sickness and in health.Angeline\u2019s cousin Mary Gilman, once a student at McGrawville, came to\nShalersville seeking to enlarge the curriculum of the institute with a\ncourse in fine arts.She hindered more than she helped, and in January\nwent away\u2014but not till she had taught Angeline to paint in oil.News came of the death of Joseph\nDowns, and Angeline wrote to her aunt, his mother:\n\n    He always seemed like a brother to me.I remember all our long walks\n    and rides to school.How kind it was in him to carry me all that\n    cold winter.Then our rides to church, and all the times we have\n    been together.... I can send you the money I owed him any time.... I\n    never can be enough obliged to him for his kindness in lending me\n    that money, and I wished to see him very much, that I might tell him\n    how thankful I felt when he sent it to me.Her sister Ruth wrote:\n\n    Sweet sister, I am so _very lonely_.It would do me so much good to\n    tell you all I wish.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.I have never found... one so _willing to share\n    all my grief and joy_.But when Angeline did at length return to Rodman, Ruth\u2019s comfort must\nhave been mixed with pain.A letter to Asaph tells the story:\n\n    It is almost dark, but I wish to write a few words to you before I\n    go to bed.I have had one of those bad spells of paralysis this\n    afternoon, so that I could not speak for a minute or two.... I do\n    not know what is to become of me.If I had some quiet little room\n    with you perhaps I might get strength slowly and be good for\n    something after awhile.... I do not mourn much for the blasting of\n    my own hopes of usefulness; but I can not bear to be the canker worm\n    destroying all your beautiful buds of promise.She remained in poor health a long time\u2014so thin and pale that old\nacquaintances hardly knew her.She wrote:\n\n    I feel something as a stranger feels in a strange land I guess.This\n    makes me turn to you with all the more love.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                            STRENUOUS TIMES.They had left Shalersville resolved that Asaph should continue his\nstudies, but undecided where to go.Professor Br\u00fcnnow invited him to Ann\nArbor; and Mr.Bond, director of the Harvard College Observatory,\nencouraged him to go there.Besides, the famous mathematician Benjamin\nPeirce taught at Harvard.Not till they reached Cleveland was the\ndecision made.The way West was barred by a storm on Lake Erie, and\nAngeline said, \u201cLet\u2019s go East.\u201d\n\nSo she returned to Rodman for a visit, while her husband set out for\nHarvard University.Fifty years and more have passed since then.Their\nfour sons have long since graduated at Harvard, and growing\ngrandchildren are turning their eyes thither.Hall talked with\nProfessors Peirce and Bond, and with the dean of the faculty, Professor\nHosford.All gave him encouragement, and he proceeded to Plymouth\nHollow, Conn., now called Thomaston, to earn money enough at carpentry\nto give him a start.He earned the highest wages given to carpenters at\nthat time, a dollar and a half a day; but his wife\u2019s poor health almost\ndiscouraged him.On May 19, 1857, he wrote her as follows:\n\n    I get along very well with my work, and try to study a little in the\n    evenings, but find it rather hard business after a day\u2019s labor.... I\n    don\u2019t fairly know what we had better do, whether I had better keep\n    on with my studies or not.It would be much pleasanter for you, I\n    suppose, were I to give up the pursuit of my studies, and try to get\n    us a home.But then, as I have no tact for money-making by\n    speculation, and it would take so long to earn enough with my hands\n    to buy a home, we should be old before it would be accomplished, and\n    in this case, my studies would have to be given up forever.I do not\n    like to do this, for it seems to me that with two years\u2019 more study\n    I can attain a position in which I can command a decent salary.Perhaps in less time, I can pay my way at Cambridge, either by\n    teaching or by assisting in the Observatory.But how and where we\n    shall live during the two years is the difficulty.I shall try to\n    make about sixty dollars before the first of August.With this money\n    I think that I could stay at Cambridge one year and might possibly\n    find a situation so that we might make our home there.But I think that it is not best that we should both go to Cambridge\n    with so little money, and run the risk of my finding employment.You\n    must come here and stay with our folks until I get something\n    arranged at Cambridge, and then, I hope that we can have a permanent\n    home.... Make up your mind to be a stout-hearted little woman for a\n    couple of years.But Angeline begged to go to Cambridge with him, although she wrote:\n\n    These attacks are so sudden, I might be struck down instantly, or\n    become helpless or senseless.About the first of July she went to Goshen, Conn., to stay with his\nmother, in whom she found a friend.Though very delicate, she was\nindustrious.Her husband\u2019s strong twin sisters wondered how he would\nsucceed with such a poor, weak little wife.But Asaph\u2019s mother assured\nher son that their doubts were absurd, as Angeline accomplished as much\nas both the twins together.So it came to pass that in the latter part of August, 1857, Asaph Hall\narrived in Cambridge with fifty dollars in his pocket and an invalid\nwife on his arm.George Bond, son of the director of the\nobservatory, told him bluntly that if he followed astronomy he would\nstarve.He had no money, no social position, no friends.What right had\nhe and his delicate wife to dream of a scientific career?The best the\nHarvard Observatory could do for him the first six months of his stay\nwas to pay three dollars a week for his services.Then his pay was\nadvanced to four dollars.Early in 1858 he got some extra work\u2014observing\nmoon-culminations in connection with Col.Joseph E. Johnston\u2019s army\nengineers.For each observation he received a dollar; and fortune so far\nfavored the young astronomer that in the month of March he made\ntwenty-three such observations.His faithful wife, as regular as an\nalarm clock, would waken him out of a sound sleep and send him off to\nthe observatory.In 1858, also, he began to eke out his income by\ncomputing almanacs, earning the first year about one hundred and thirty\ndollars; but competition soon made such work unprofitable.In less than\na year he had won the respect of Mr.George Bond by solving problems\nwhich that astronomer was unable to solve; and at length, in the early\npart of 1859, upon the death of the elder Bond, his pay was raised to\nfour hundred dollars a year.After his experience such a salary seemed quite munificent.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.The twin\nsisters visited Cambridge and were much dissatisfied with Asaph\u2019s\npoverty.They tried to persuade Angeline to make him go into some more\nprofitable business.Sibley, college librarian, observing his shabby\novercoat and thin face, exclaimed, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t live on bread and\nmilk!\u201d The young man was living on astronomy, and his delicate wife was\naiding and abetting him.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.In less than a year after his arrival at\nCambridge, he had become a good observer.He\nwas pursuing his studies with great ardor.He read _Br\u00fcnnow\u2019s Astronomy_\nin German, which language his wife taught him mornings as he kindled the\nfire.In 1858 he was reading _Gauss\u2019s Theoria Motus_.Angeline was determined her husband should make good use of the talents\nGod had given him.She was courageous as only a Puritan can be.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.In\ndomestic economy she was unsurpassed.Husband and wife lived on much\nless than the average college student requires.Goodrich was state printer and claimed he had a\nright to print the proceedings of both constitutional bodies.This\naction on the part of the Pioneer produced great consternation in the\nMinnesotian office, as most of the men had not received more than half\npay for some time, and now, when the balance of their pay was almost\nin sight, they were suddenly compelled to await the slow and doubtful\naction of the courts before receiving pay for their summer's work.The\ndistrict court, subsequently confirmed by the supreme court, decided\nin favor of the Minnesotian, and the day following the decision Mr.Moore, of the Minnesotian, brought down a bag of gold from the capitol\ncontaining $4,000, and divided it up among his employes.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1858, when the first Atlantic cable was laid, the news was\nanxiously looked for, and nearly every inhabitant of the city turned\nout to greet the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two of the\nfastest boats on the river, which were expected to bring the news\nof the successful laying of the cable.The Gray Eagle started from\nDubuque at 9 o'clock in the morning and the Itasca started from\nPrairie du Chien, about 100 miles farther up the river, at noon of the\nsame day.When the boats reached the bend below the river they were\nabreast of each other, and as they reached the levee it was hardly\npossible to tell which was ahead.One of the passengers on the Gray\nEagle had a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message,\ntied up with a small stone on the inside of it, and as he threw it to\nthe shore a messenger from the Minnesotian caught it and ran up Bench\nstreet to the Minnesotian office, where the printers were waiting,\nand the Minnesotian had the satisfaction of getting out an extra some\nlittle time before their competitors.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the summer season the newspapers had to rely, to a considerable\nextent, on the steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers for\ntelegraph news.There were three or four daily lines", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "Paul, and every one of them could be distinguished by its whistle.When it was time for the arrival of the boat bringing the newspapers\nfrom which the different papers expected to get their telegraphic\nnews, messengers from the different offices would be at the levee, and\nas the boat neared the shore they would leap for the gangplank, and\nthere was always a scramble to get to the clerk's office first.James J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee\nawaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies\nof the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the\nadventurous kids from the newspaper offices.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to\nillustrate a local feature.During the summer of 1859 a man by the\nname of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county, and Gov.Sibley\ncalled out the Pioneer Guards to proceed to the place where the\nlynching occurred and arrest all persons connected with the tragedy.The Pioneer Guards was the crack military company of the state, and\nthe only service any of its members ever expected to do was in the\nballroom or to participate in a Fourth of July parade.When they were\ncalled out by the governor there was great consternation in the ranks.One of the members, who is still a prominent politician in the city,\nwhen told that his first duty was to serve his country, tremblingly\nremarked that he thought his first duty was to provide for his wife\nand family.A number of them made their wills before departing, as they thought\nthe whole of Wright county was in open rebellion.After being absent\nfor about a week they proudly marched back to the city without ever\nfiring a gun or seeing an enemy.The late J. Fletcher Williams was\ncity editor of the Minnesotian, and he wrote an extended account of\nthe expedition, and It was profusely illustrated with patent medicine\ncuts and inverted wood type and border, the only available material at\nthat time that could be procured.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe year 1859 was a memorable one in the political history of\nMinnesota.Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker, both now living in\nthis city, were the rival candidates for governor.The Republicans\nmade extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative\ntickets, as both governor and United States senator were at stake.Among the speakers imported by the Republicans were the Hon.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Galusha\nA. Grow of Pennsylvania and Hon.Grow,\nthen as now, represented the congressional district in Pennsylvania in\nwhich I formally resided, and I was very anxious to hear him, as the\nfirst political speech I had ever heard was made by him in a small\nvillage in Pennsylvania.The speakers were announced to speak at the\nold People's theater, on the corner of Fourth and St.Peter streets,\nand I was among the first to enter.Grow had made a very interesting speech of about an\nhour's duration, and Mr.Colfax was to follow for an equal length of\ntime.Colfax had spoken about ten minutes an alarm of fire\nwas sounded and in less than fifteen minutes the entire structure was\nburned to the ground.This happened about 9:30 o'clock in the\nevening, and, strange to relate, not one of the morning papers had an\nannouncement of the fact the next day.The morning papers at that time\nwere something like an evening paper of to-day.They were set up and\nmade up in the afternoon and generally printed in the early part of\nthe evening.The result of that election was very gratifying to the\nRepublicans.Foster now writing a double column\npolitical head for the Minnesotian, the first two lines of which were:\n\"Shout, Republicans, Shout!We've Cleaned the Breech Clouts Out!\"Foster was the editor of the Minnesotian and was quite a power in\nthe Republican party.He wielded a vigorous pen and possessed a very\nirascible temper.I have often seen him perform some Horace Greeley\nantics in the composing room of the old Minnesotian.At the time of\nthe execution of John Brown for his attempted raid into Virginia, I\nremember bringing the Chicago Tribune to the doctor, containing the\nannouncement of the execution.I had arranged the paper so that the\ndoctor could take in the contents of the heading at the first glance.The doctor looked at the headlines a second and then exclaimed, loud\nenough to be heard a block, \"Great God!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.In the nineteenth century, a\nman hung for an idea!\"At another time the doctor became very much enraged over some news\nthat I had laid before him.In the early 50's Galusha A. Grow, of\nPennsylvania, introduced into the house of representatives the first\nhomestead law and the Republican party soon afterward incorporated\nthe idea into their platform as one of their pet measures.After\nsuperhuman effort the bill passed the house of representatives, that\nbody being nearly tie politically, and was sent to the senate.The\nDemocratic majority in the senate was not very favorably impressed\nwith the measure, but with the assistance of the late President\nJohnson, who was senator from Tennessee at that time, the bill passed\nthe senate by a small majority.There was great rejoicing over the\nevent and no one supposed for a moment that the president would veto\nthe measure.When I laid the Chicago Tribune before the excitable\ndoctor containing the announcement of Buchanan's veto the very air was\nblue with oaths.The doctor took the paper and rushed out into the\nstreet waving the paper frantically in the air, cursing the president\nat every step.*       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom 1854, the date of the starting of the three St.Paul daily\npapers, until 1860, the time of the completion of the Winslow\ntelegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer,\nMinnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the\nstreet with the full text of the president's message.The messages of\nPierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding\ntheir arrival the various offices had all the type of every\ndescription distributed and all the printers who could possibly be\nprocured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming\nmessage.It was customary to pay every one employed, from the devil to\nthe foreman, $2.50 in gold, and every printer in the city was notified\nto be in readiness for the approaching typographical struggle.One\nyear one of the proprietors of the Minnesotian thought he would\nsurprise the other offices, and he procured the fastest livery team In\nthe city and went down the river as far as Red Wing to intercept the\nmail coach, and expected to return to St.Paul three or four hours in\nadvance of the regular mail, which would give him that much advantage\nover his competitors.Owing to some miscalculation as to the time the\nstage left Chicago the message was delivered in St.Paul twenty-four\nhours earlier than was expected, and the proprietor of the Minnesotian\nhad the pleasure of receiving a copy of his own paper, containing the\ncomplete message, long before he returned to St.The management\nalways provided an oyster supper for the employes of the paper first\nout with the message, and it generally required a week for the typos\nto fully recover from its effect.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAs an evidence of what was uppermost in the minds of most people at\nthis time, and is probably still true to-day, it may be related that\nin the spring of 1860, when the great prize fight between Heenan and\nSayers was to occur in England, and the meeting of the Democratic\nnational convention in Charleston, in which the Minnesota Democrats\nwere in hopes that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, would be nominated\nfor president, the first question asked by the people I would meet on\nthe way from the boat landing to the office would be: \"Anything from\nthe prize fight?*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The good old times\" printers often talk about were evidently not the\nyears between the great panic of 1857 and the breaking out of the\nCivil war in 1861.Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to\nspeak of.When a man did occasionally get a dollar he was not sure it\nwould be worth its face value when the next boat would arrive with\na new Bank Note Reporter.Married men considered themselves very\nfortunate when they could get, on Saturday night, an order on a\ngrocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars, and the single\nmen seldom received more than $2 or $3 cash.That was not more than\nhalf enough to pay their board bill.This state of affairs continued\nuntil the Press was started in 1861, when Gov.Marshall inaugurated\nthe custom, which still prevails, of paying his employes every\nSaturday night.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother instance of the lack of enterprise on the part of the daily\npaper of that day:\n\nDuring the summer of 1860 a large party of Republican statesmen and\npoliticians visited St.Senator John P.

Seward in the senate\njust previous to the breaking out of the war.Seward's well-known\nideas were so closely imitated that their genuineness were not\nquestioned.The rest of the news was made up of dispatches purporting\nto be from the then excited Southern States.The Minnesotian received\na Pioneer about 4 o'clock in the morning and by 8 the entire edition\nwas distributed throughout the city.I had distributed the Minnesotian\nthroughout the upper portion of the city, and just as I returned to\nBridge Square I met the carrier of the Pioneer, and laughed at him for\nbeing so late.As soon as I learned what\nhad happened I did not do either.The best of the joke was, the Times\ncould not obtain an early copy of the Pioneer and set up the bogus\nnews from the Minnesotian, and had their edition printed and ready to\ncirculate when they heard of the sell.They at once set up the genuine\nnews and circulated both the bogus and regular, and made fun of the\nMinnesotian for being so easily taken in.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was\nstarted, on the 1st of January, 1861.Winslow for full telegraphic dispatches, but there was another\nhitch in the spring of 1861 and for some time the Press had to obtain\nits telegraph from proof sheets of the St.Anthony Falls News, a paper\npublished in what is now East Minneapolis.Marshall was very much\nexercised at being compelled to go to a neighboring town for telegraph\nnews, and one night when news of unusual importance was expected he\nhad a very stormy interview with Mr.No one ever knew exactly\nwhat he told him, but that night the Press had full telegraphic\nreports, and has had ever since.*       *       *       *       *\n\nGov.When the first battle of Bull Run\noccurred the earlier reports announced a great Union victory.I\nremember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper\nas a young kitten.After the circus was out I went back to the office\nto see if any late news had been received.Marshall at the\ndoor, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the\nUnion force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the\ncountry would never recover from it.But it did, and the governor\nwas afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his\ncountry's honor.*       *       *       *       *\n\nPrinters were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for\n\"three hundred thousand more\" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that\nit was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a\nrespectable appearance.The Press advertised for anything that could\nset type to come in and help it out.I remember one man applying\nwho said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical\nknowledge of the business.One evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the\nlate T.M.Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and\ntold the foreman he thought he could help him out.He was given a\npiece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press.He was over eighty years old and managed to set about 1,000 ems.Metcalf got alarmed at his father's absence from home and searched the\ncity over, and finally found him in the composing room of the Press.The old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining\nuntil the paper was up.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAlthough Minnesota sent to the war as many, if not more, men than any\nother state in the Union in proportion to its population, yet it was\nnecessary to resort to a draft in a few counties where the population\nwas largely foreign.The feeling against the draft was very bitter,\nand the inhabitants of the counties which were behind in the quota did\nnot take kindly to the idea of being drafted to fight for a cause they\ndid not espouse.A riot was feared, and troops were ordered down from\nthe fort to be in readiness for any disturbance that might occur.Arrangements for the prosecution of the draft were made as rapidly as\npossible, but the provost marshal was not in readiness to have it take\nplace on the day designated by the war department.This situation\nof affairs was telegraphed to the president and the following\ncharacteristic reply was received: \"If the draft cannot take place, of\ncourse it cannot take place.The\nbitterest feeling of the anti-drafters seemed to be against the\nold St.Paul Press, a paper that earnestly advocated the vigorous\nprosecution of the war.Threats were made to mob the office.A company\nwas organized for self-defense, and Capt.Otis, now of West\nSuperior, one of the Press compositors at that time, was made post\ncommander.Otis had seen service in the early part of the war\nand the employes considered themselves fortunate in having a genuine\nmilitary man for a leader.The office was barricaded, fifteen old\nSpringfield muskets and 800 rounds of ammunition was brought", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "I slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building\noverlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my\nbed.I was supposed to give the alarm should the mob arrive after the\nemployes had gone home.As there was no possible avenue of escape in\ncase of an attack, it looks now as if the post commander displayed\npoor judgment in placing a lone sentinel on guard.The excitement gradually died away and the draft took place\nwithout interruption.*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore and some time after the war the daily newspapers took advantage\nof all the holidays and seldom issued papers on the days following\nChristmas, New Year's, Washington's birthday, Fourth of July\nand Thanksgiving.On the Fourth of July, 1863, the Pioneer made\narrangements to move from their old quarters near the corner of Third\nand Cedar streets to the corner of Third and Robert.It happened\nthat on that day two of the greatest events of the Civil war had\noccurred--the battle of Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg.The\nPioneer being engaged in moving their plant could not issue an extra\non that occasion, and the Press had the field exclusively to itself.The news of these two great events had become pretty generally known\nthroughout the city and the anxiety to get fuller particulars was\nsimply intense.The Press, having a clear field for that day, did not\npropose to issue its extra until the fullest possible details had\nbeen received.A great crowd had assembled in front of the old Press\noffice, anxiously awaiting details of the great Union victories.I had\nhelped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the\npress room.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed\nI attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale.As I opened the side door of the press room and undertook to reach the\ncounting room by a short circuit, I found the crowd on the outside had\nbecome so large that it was impossible to gain an entrance in that\ndirection, and undertook to retreat and try another route.But quicker\nthan a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and\nwalked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what\nfew papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out.As soon as the\nmagnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air,\nand cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a\nnoise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St.Paul had\ncelebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history.*       *       *       *       *\n\nI arrived in St.Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and\nImmediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo.W. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper.I had not been at\nwork long before I learned what a \"scoop\" was.Congress had passed\na bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no\ntelegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three\ndays for the news to reach the state.The Pioneer, Minnesotian and\nTimes were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening\nbefore.It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was\nbrought to St.Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of\nthe Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same\non the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers.The\nMinnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers\nand they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise.It\nwas not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining\nnews and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter.I could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops\n'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860.*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to\nexpand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of\nour rapidly increasing population.The various papers were printed on\nsingle-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were\nintroduced.In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the\ncity, printing four pages at one time.In 1880 the different offices\nintroduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines\nwere installed.The next great advance will probably be some system of\nphotography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer\nand proofreader.THE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION.EARLY STEAMBOATING--CELEBRATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAYING OF THE FIRST\nATLANTIC CABLE--A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CHIPPEWAS AND SIOUXS.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.\"Right this way for the Winslow\nhouse!\"\"Merchants hotel\non the levee!\"These were the\nannouncements that would greet the arrival of travelers as they would\nalight from one of the splendid steamers of the Galena, Dunleith,\nDubuque and Minnesota Packet company during the days when traveling\nby steamboat was the only way of reaching points on the upper\nMississippi.Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house,\nthe Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western\nhouse, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years\nattracted the attention of the visitor, and many others.The Merchants\nis the only one left, and that only in name.Messengers from newspaper\noffices, representatives of storage and commission houses, merchants\nlooking for consignments of goods, residents looking for friends, and\nthe ever alert dealers in town lots on the scent of fresh victims,\nwere among the crowds that daily congregated at the levee whenever the\narrival of one of the packet company's regular steamers was expected.At one time there was a daily line of steamers to La Crosse, a daily\nline to Prairie du Chien, a daily line to Dubuque and a line to St.Louis, and three daily lines for points on the Minnesota river.Does any one remember the deep bass whistle of the Gray Eagle, the\ncombination whistle on the Key City, the ear-piercing shriek of the\nlittle Antelope, and the discordant notes of the calliope on the\nDenmark?The officers of these packets were the king's of the day, and\nwhen any one of them strayed up town he attracted as much attention as\na major general of the regulars.It was no uncommon sight to see six\nor eight steamers at the levee at one time, and their appearance\npresented a decided contrast to the levee of the present time.The\nfirst boat through the lake in the spring was granted free wharfage,\nand as that meant about a thousand dollars, there was always an\neffort made to force a passage through the lake as soon as possible.Traveling by steamboat during the summer months was very pleasant,\nbut it was like taking a trip to the Klondike to go East during the\nwinter.Merchants were compelled to supply themselves with enough\ngoods to last from November till April, as it was too expensive\nto ship goods by express during the winter.Occasionally some\nenterprising merchant would startle the community by announcing\nthrough the newspapers that he had just received by Burbank's express\na new pattern in dress goods, or a few cans of fresh oysters.The\nstages on most of the routes left St.Paul at 4 o'clock in the\nmorning, and subscribers to daily newspapers within a radius of forty\nmiles of the city could read the news as early as they can during\nthese wonderful days of steam and electricity.*       *       *       *       *\n\nProbably no election ever occurred in Minnesota that excited so much\ninterest as the one known as the \"Five Million Loan Election.\"It was\nnot a party measure, as the leading men of both parties favored it;\nalthough the Republicans endeavored to make a little capital out of it\nat a later period.The only paper of any prominence that opposed the\npassage of the amendment was the Minnesotian, edited by Dr.That paper was very violent in its abuse of every one who\nfavored the passage of the law, and its opposition probably had an\nopposite effect from what was intended by the redoubtable doctor.The\ngreat panic of 1857 had had a very depressing effect on business\nof every description and it was contended that the passage of this\nmeasure would give employment to thousands of people; that the\nrumbling of the locomotive would soon be heard in every corner of the\nstate, and that the dealer in town lots and broad acres would again be\nable to complacently inform the newcomer the exact locality where a\nfew dollars would soon bring to the investor returns unheard of by\nany ordinary methods of speculation.The campaign was short and the\namendment carried by an immense majority.So nearly unanimous was\nthe sentiment of the community in favor of the measure that it was\nextremely hazardous for any one to express sentiments In opposition to\nit.Paul, with a population of about 10,000, gave a\nmajority of over 4,000 for the law.There was no Australian law\nat that time, and one could vote early and often without fear of\nmolestation.One of the amusing features of the campaign, and in\nopposition to the measure, was a cartoon drawn by R.O.Sweeney, now\na resident of Duluth.The\nnewspapers had no facilities for printing cartoons at that time.They\nhad to be printed on a hand press and folded into the papers.It was\nproposed, by the terms of this amendment to the constitution, to\ndonate to four different railroad companies $10,000 per mile for every\nmile of road graded and ready to iron.Work Was commenced soon after\nthe passage of the law, and in a short time a demand was made by the\nrailroad companies upon Gov.Sibley for the issuance of the bonds, in\naccordance with their idea of the terms of the contract made by the\nstate.Sibley declined to issue the bonds until the rights of\nthe state had been fully protected.The railroad companies would not\naccept the restrictions placed upon them by the governor, and they\nobtained a peremptory writ from the supreme court directing that they\nbe issued.The governor held that the supreme court had no authority\nto coerce the executive branch of the state government, but on the\nadvice of the attorney general, and rather than have any friction\nbetween the two branches of the government, he, in accordance with the\nmandate of the court, reluctantly signed the bonds.Judge Flandrau\ndissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas\nprevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly\nimproved.Sibley was sincere in his\nefforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with\nthe same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall.Sibley was the legal\ngovernor of Minnesota, and Tie contended that he had no right to sign\nthe bonds: that their issuance was illegal, and that neither the\nprincipal nor the interest would ever be paid.The Minnesotian carried\nat the head of its columns the words \"Official Paper of the City,\" and\nit was feared that its malignant attacks upon the state officials,\ndenouncing the issuance of the bonds as fraudulent and illegal, would\nbe construed abroad as reflecting the sentiment of the majority of the\npeople in the the community in which it was printed, and would have a\nbad effect in the East when the time came to negotiate the bonds.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.An\neffort was made to induce the city council to deprive that paper of\nits official patronage, but that body could not see its way clear to\nabrogate its contract.Threats were made to throw the office into the\nriver, but they did not materialize.Sibley endeavored\nto place these bonds on the New York market he was confronted\nwith conditions not anticipated, and suffered disappointment and\nhumiliation in consequence of the failure of the attempt.The whole railway construction scheme\nsuddenly collapsed, the railroad companies defaulted, the credit of\nthe state was compromised, \"and enterprise of great pith and\nmoment had turned their currents awry.\"The evil forbodings of the\nMinnesotian became literally true, and for more than twenty years\nthe repudiated bonds of Minnesota were a blot on the pages of her\notherwise spotless record.Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on\nwhich the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to\nnew organizations.Pillsbury the\nstate compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per\ncent of their nominal value.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee\nbetween the Sioux and the Chippewas.A party of Chippewa warriors,\nunder the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a\nbody of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly\nopened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty.Eight or\nten Chippewas were killed during the engagement.The daily papers\nsent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that\nvicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements.Among\nthe reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the\nEastern cities.He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and\nfurnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of\nthe preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable\nto find out the \"origin of the difficulty.\"As the Sioux and\nChippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded\nconsiderable amusement to the old inhabitants.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe celebration in St.Paul in honor of the successful laying of the\nAtlantic cable, which took place on the first day of September, 1858,\nwas one of the first as well as one of the most elaborate celebrations\nthat ever occurred in the city.The announcement of the completion of\nthe enterprise, which occurred on the 5th of the previous month, did\nnot reach St.Paul until two or three days later, as there was no\ntelegraphic communication to the city at that time.As soon as\nmessages had been exchanged between Queen Victoria and President\nBuchanan it was considered safe to make preparations for a grand\ncelebration.Most of the cities throughout the United States were\nmaking preparations to celebrate on that day, and St.Paul did not\npropose to be outdone.The city council appropriated several hundred\ndollars to assist in the grand jubilation and illumination.An\nelaborate program was prepared and a procession that would do credit\nto the city at the present time marched through the principal streets,\nto the edification of thousands of spectators from the city and\nsurrounding country.To show that a procession in the olden time was\nvery similar to one of the up-to-date affairs, the following order of\nprocession is appended:\n\nTHE PROCESSION.Floral procession with escort of Mounted Cadets,\n    representing Queen Victoria, President Buchanan,\n    the different States of the Union, and\n    other devices.Officers and Crews of Vessels in Port.AC Jones, adjutant general of the state, was marshal-in-chief,\nand he was assisted by a large number of aides.The Pioneer Guards,\nthe oldest military company in the state, had the right of line.They\nhad just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the\ndrum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days,\npresented a very imposing appearance.The Pioneer Guards were followed\nby the City Guards, under Capt.A detachment of cavalry\nand the City Battery completed the military part of the affair.The\nfire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H.\nWilliams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha\nEngine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was\nthe next in order.One of the most attractive features of the occasion\nwas the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company.In a large car\ndrawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of\nprinters and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several\nepochs in the life of the great philosopher.In the car with the\nrepresentatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a\nbeautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's\ntheater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear.The car was ornamented with\nflowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions\n\"Franklin,\" \"Morse,\" \"Field.\"The Pioneer book bindery was also\nrepresented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female,\nwere employed in different branches", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "While talking, the whistle of the locomotive was distinctly but faintly\nheard, and the column was at once moved forward, the Second New York in\nadvance.As we neared the station the whistles became more and more\ndistinct, and a scout reported the trains rapidly unloading, and that the\nadvance of the rebel army was passing through Appomattox Court House.Although Custer's orders were to make a junction with Merritt before\ncoming in contact with the enemy, here was a chance to strike a decisive\nblow, which, if successful, would add to his renown and glory, and if not,\nMerritt would soon be up to help him out of the scrape.Our excitement was\nintense, but subdued.All saw the vital importance of heading off the\nenemy.Another whistle, nearer and clearer, and another scout decided the\nquestion.I was ordered to move rapidly to Appomattox Station, seize the\ntrains there, and, if possible, get possession of the Lynchburg pike.General Custer rode up alongside of me and, laying his hand on my\nshoulder, said, \"Go in, old fellow, don't let anything stop you; now is\nthe chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you.\"The regiment\nleft the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we\ncaught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a\ncheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three\ntrains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and\nfiremen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men\naround me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered\nthe trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were\nclaimed as captures by General Ord's corps.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.The cars were loaded with\ncommissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the\nrebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly\ndown on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a\nfierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did\nbut little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by\na dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel\nPennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily\nskirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily\nconstructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which\nimmense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was\nordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's\nlines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest\nof the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then\nCuster, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and\ncharge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without\norganization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and\neverywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize\nwas so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel\ninfantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and\ndestruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so\nas soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,\nonly to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting\nwould not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the\noffensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I\nwent to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would\nlet me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He\nexcitedly replied, \"Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything\nyou can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold\nof the pike to-night.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by\nme, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other\nregiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge\ndown a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery\nwas posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright\nlights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot\nswept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.The\nline was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,\nnow pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither\nprisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and\nartillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and\nheaded for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we\ndiscovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit\nwas checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his\nroute to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that\nour cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our\nmen dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant\nColonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a\npicket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other\ndivisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late\nto take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took\nhours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the\nrailroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground\nto rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our\nassistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line\nwould be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work\nto head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud\nhurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming\nin rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving\ntowards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing\nlively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry\ncorps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the\nposition of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who\ngreeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to \"run the gauntlet\" of fire from the enemy's\nguns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest\nof the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy\nto put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at\nlast Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving\nat almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of\na surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste\nfor the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a\nparty of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly\nreplied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a\ncharge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the\ncharge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we\nhalted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we\ncharged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front\nwas a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,\nwith batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have\ncharged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost\ntotal annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that\npreliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon\nall became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward\nbetween the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends\namong the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee\n(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus\nWilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the\nground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I\ncalled to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a\nhostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General\nLee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General\nBabcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our\nlines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he\ngracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,\nwhich was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with\ncheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and\nthe rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our\nmen, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations\nwith the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that\nthe rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels\nseemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,\ndissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands\neager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to\neat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with\nColonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender\nhad taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that\neverything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in\nwhose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at\nManassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his\nname in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden\nharvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories\nof these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record\nof great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their\nheads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the\ncongratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They\nfelt they had done their duty, and given the \"tottering giant\" a blow that\nlaid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.Jacob Wire, with whom it was proposed to apprentice him, had the\nreputation of being a hard master.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.He loved money, and did not love\nanything else.His heart was barren of affection, as his soul was of\ngood principles; and though he did not literally starve his family and\nhis help, he fed them upon the poorest and meanest fare that would\nsupport human life.The paupers in the poorhouse lived sumptuously,\ncompared with those who gathered around the board of Jacob Wire.The keeper knew this from experience, for years ago, before he had\nbeen appointed to his present situation, he had worked for Wire; and\nage and prosperity had not improved him.The more he got, the more he\nwanted; the fuller his barn and storehouse, the more stingy he became\nto those who were dependent upon him.Harry West was a good boy, and a great favorite with the keeper of the\npoorhouse.He was always good-natured, willing to work, and never\ngrumbled about his food.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.He was not only willing to take care of the\nbaby washing days, but seemed to derive pleasure from the occupation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.Nason liked Harry, and had a deep interest\nin his welfare; something more than a merely selfish interest, for he\nhad suggested to the overseers the propriety of binding him out to\nlearn some good trade.Harry was sad and disheartened; but he had unlimited confidence in the\nkeeper, and felt sure that he would protect him from such a calamity\nas being sent to Jacob Wire's.After he had carried the windfalls into\nthe shed, he asked Mr.Nason if he might go down to the river for a\nlittle while.The permission given, he jumped over the cow yard wall,\nand with his eyes fixed in deep thought upon the ground, made his way\nover the hill to Pine Pleasant, as the beautiful grove by the river's\nside was called.The grove extended to the brink of the stream, which in this place\nwidened into a pond.Near the shore was a large flat rock, which was\nconnected with the mainland by a log, for the convenience of anglers\nand bathers.This was a favorite spot with Harry; and upon the rock he\nseated himself, to sigh over the hard lot which was in store for him.It was not a good way to contend with the trials to which all are\nsubjected; but he had not yet learned that sorrow and adversity are as\nnecessary for man as joy and prosperity.Besides, it was a turning\npoint in his life, and it seemed to him that Jacob Wire's house would\nbe the tomb of all his hopes.CHAPTER II\n\nIN WHICH HARRY FINDS A FRIEND, AND A PRACTICABLE SCHEME FOR RESISTANCE\n\n\nMy young readers will probably desire to know something about Harry's\n\"antecedents\"; and while the poor fellow is mourning over the hard\nlot which Squire Walker has marked out for him, we will briefly review\nhis previous history.Unlike the heroes of modern novels and romances, Harry did not belong\nto an ancient, or even a very respectable family.We need not trace\nhis genealogy for any considerable period, and I am not sure that the\nold records would throw much light on the subject if we should attempt\nto do so.The accident of birth in our republican land is a matter of\nvery little consequence; therefore we shall only go back to Harry's\nfather, who was a carpenter by trade, but had a greater passion for\nNew England rum than for chisels and foreplanes.The bane of New England was the bane of Franklin West; for he was a\nkind-hearted man, a good husband and a good father, before he was\ndeformed by the use of liquor.He made good wages, and supported his\nlittle family for several years; but the vile habit grew upon him to\nsuch a degree that the people of Redfield lost all confidence in him.As his business decreased, his besetting vice increased upon him, till\nhe was nothing but the wreck of the man he had once been.Poverty had\ncome, and want stared him in the face.While everybody was wondering what would become of Franklin West, he\nsuddenly disappeared, and no one could form an idea of what had become\nof him.He was only a nuisance\nto himself and his family.West was shocked by this sudden and\nmysterious disappearance.He was her husband, and the father of her\nchildren, and it was not strange that she wept, and even hoped that he\nwould come back.The neighbors comforted her, and put her in the way\nof supporting herself and the children, so that she was very soon\nreconciled to the event.When West had been gone a month, his wife received a letter from him,\ninforming her that he had determined to stop drinking, and be a man\nagain.He could not keep sober in Redfield, among his old companions,\nand he was at work in Providence till he could get money enough to\npay his expenses to Valparaiso, in South America, where a lucrative\nplace awaited him.He hoped his wife would manage to get along for a\nfew months, when he should be able to send her some money.Her husband was not dead, was not drowned in\nthe river, or lost in the woods; and her heart was cheered by the\nprospects of future plenty, which the letter pointed out to her.A year passed by, and nothing more was", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "The\npoor, forsaken wife had a hard time to support her little family.The\nmost constant and severe toil enabled her to pinch her way along; but\nit was a bitter trial.She had no relations to help her; and though\nthe neighbors were as kind as neighbors could be, life was a hard\nstruggle.This bereavement seemed to unnerve\nand discourage her, and though there was one mouth less to feed, her\nstrength failed her, and she was unequal to the task.Care and sorrow\ndid their work upon her, and though people said she died of\nconsumption, Heaven knew she died of a broken heart and disappointed\nhopes.Harry was four years old when this sad event left him alone in the\nworld.There was none willing to assume the burden of bringing up the\nlonely little pilgrim, and he was sent to the poorhouse.It was a hard\nfate for the tender child to be removed from the endearments of a\nmother's love, and placed in the cheerless asylum which public charity\nprovides for the poor and the friendless.The child was only four years old; but he missed the fond kiss and the\nloving caresses of his devoted mother.They were kind to him there,\nbut it was not home, and his heart could not but yearn for those\ntreasures of affection which glittered for him only in the heart of\nhis mother.There was an aching void, and though he could not\nunderstand or appreciate his loss, it was none the less painful.He was a favorite child, not only with the old paupers, but with the\nkeeper and his family; and this circumstance undoubtedly softened the\nasperities of his lot.As soon as he was old enough, he was required\nto work as much as the keeper thought his strength would bear.He was\nvery handy about the house and barn, more so than boys usually are;\nand Mr.Nason declared that, for the three years before it was\nproposed to send him away, he had more than earned his board and\nclothes.He had been at school four winters, and the schoolmasters were\nunanimous in their praise.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.He was a smart scholar, but a little\ndisposed to be roguish.The moral discipline of the poorhouse was not of the most salutary\ncharacter.Nason, though a generous and kind-hearted man, was not\nas exemplary in his daily life as might have been desired.Besides,\none or two of the old paupers were rather corrupt in their manners and\nmorals, and were not fit companions for a young immortal, whose mind,\nlike plastic clay, was impressible to the forming power.The poorhouse was not a good place for the boy, and the wonder is that\nHarry, at twelve years of age, was not worse than we find him.Nason, as he had learned to fear and to hate\nSquire Walker.The latter seemed to have absolute power at the\npoorhouse, and to be lord and master in Redfield.But when the\noverseer proposed to place the boy in the family of a man whom even\nthe paupers looked down upon and despised, his soul rebelled even\nagainst the mandate of the powerful magnate of the town.Harry turned the matter over and over in his mind as he sat upon the\nrock at Pine Pleasant.At first he tried to reconcile the idea of\nliving with Jacob Wire; but it was a fruitless effort.The poorhouse\nseemed like a paradise to such a fate.Then he considered the possibility and the practicability of resisting\nthe commands of Squire Walker.He could not obtain much satisfaction\nfrom either view of the difficult problem, and as a happy resort under\nthe trials of the moment, he began to console himself with the\nreflection that Mr.Nason might prevail with the overseers, and save\nhim from his doom.He had not much hope from this direction, and while he was turning\nagain to the question of resistance, he heard footsteps in the grove.He did not feel like seeing any person and wished he could get out of\nsight; but there was no retreating without being observed, so he lay\ndown upon the rock to wait till the intruder had passed.The person approaching did not purpose to let him off so easily; and\nwhen Harry heard his step on the log he raised himself up.It was Ben Smart, a boy of fourteen, who lived near the poorhouse.Ben's reputation in Redfield was not A, No.1; in fact, he had been\nsolemnly and publicly expelled from the district school only three\ndays before by Squire Walker, because the mistress could not manage\nhim.His father was the village blacksmith, and as he had nothing for\nhim to do--not particularly for the boy's benefit--he kept him at\nschool all the year round.replied Harry, more for the sake of being civil\nthan because he wished to speak to the other.asked Ben, who evidently did not understand\nhow a boy could be there alone, unless he was occupied about\nsomething.He suspected that Harry had been engaged in some\nmysterious occupation, which he desired to conceal from him.It was worse than\nthe double rule of three, which he conscientiously believed had been\ninvented on purpose to bother school boys.\"You are up to some trick, I know.Tell me what you come down here\nfor.\"No feller would come clear down here\nfor nothing.\"\"I came down to think, then, if you must know,\" answered Harry, rather\ntestily.Ain't the poor-farm big enough to\ndo your thinking on?\"I should think old Walker had\nbeen afoul of you, by your looks.\"Harry looked up suddenly, and wondered if Ben knew what had happened.\"I should like to have the old rascal down here for half an hour.I\nshould like to souse him into the river, and hold his head under till\nhe begged my pardon,\" continued Ben.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.I mean to pay him off for\nwhat he did for me the other day.I wouldn't minded being turned out\nof school.I rather liked the idea; but the old muttonhead got me up\nbefore all the school, and read me such a lecture!He thinks there\nisn't anybody in the world but him.\"\"The lecture didn't hurt you,\" suggested Harry.\"My father give me a confounded licking when I got home.But I will pay 'em for it all.\"\"If I only had a father, I wouldn't mind letting him lick me now and\nthen,\" replied Harry, to whom home seemed a paradise, though he had\nnever understood it; and a father and mother, though coarse and\nbrutal, his imagination pictured as angels.\"My father would learn you better than that in a few days,\" said Ben,\nwho did not appreciate his parents, especially when they held the rod.He thought how happy he should have\nbeen in Ben's place.We value most what we\nhave not; and if the pauper boy could have had the blessings which\ncrowned his reckless companion's lot, it seemed as though he would\nhave been contented and happy.His condescension in regard to the\nflogging now and then was a sincere expression of feeling.\"What's old Walker been doing to you, Harry?\"asked Ben, suspecting\nthe cause of the other's gloom.\"He is going to send me to Jacob Wire's to live.\"To die, you mean; Harry, I wouldn't stand\nthat.\"\"That's right; I like your spunk.He possessed a certain\ndegree of prudence, and though it was easy to declare war against so\npowerful an enemy as Squire Walker, it was not so easy to carry on the\nwar after it was declared.The overseer was a bigger man to him than\nthe ogre in \"Puss in Boots.\"Probably his imagination largely\nmagnified the grandeur of the squire's position, and indefinitely\nmultiplied the resources at his command.repeated Ben, who for some reason or other\ntook a deep interest in Harry's affairs.I would rather die than go; but I don't know how I can\nhelp myself,\" answered the poor boy, gloomily.Ben sympathized with him\nin his trials, and his heart warmed towards him.\"I daresn't tell you now,\" replied Ben after a short pause.You are a first rate feller, and I like\nyou.But you see, if you should blow on me now, you would spoil my\nkettle of fish, and your own, too.\"\"Well, then, I will get you out of the scrape as nice as a cotton\nhat.\"\"I guess I won't tell you now; but if you will come down here to-night\nat eleven o'clock I will let you into the whole thing.\"We all go to bed at eight\no'clock.\"Nason will persuade the overseers not\nto send me to Jacob Wire's.\"\"I'm glad I didn't tell you, then.But promise me this, Harry: that,\nwhatever happens, you'll hold your tongue.\"\"And if Nason don't get you off, be here at eleven o'clock.Put on\nyour best clothes, and take everything you want with you.\"Ben made him promise again to be secret, and they separated.Harry had\nan idea of what his companion intended, and the scheme solved all his\ndoubts.It was a practicable scheme of resistance, and he returned to\nthe poorhouse, no longer fearful of the impending calamity.CHAPTER III\n\nIN WHICH HARRY LEAVES THE POORHOUSE, AND TAKES TO THE RIVER\n\n\nWhen Harry reached the poorhouse, Mr.Nason was absent, and one of the\npaupers told him that he had taken the horse and wagon.He conjectured\nthat the keeper had gone to see the other overseers, to intercede with\nthem in his behalf.He did not feel as much interest in the mission as\nhe had felt two hours before, for Ben Stuart had provided a remedy for\nhis grievances, which he had fully decided to adopt.Nason returned; and when he came his\nlooks did not seem to indicate a favorable issue.Harry helped him\nunharness the horse, and as he led him into the barn the keeper opened\nthe subject.\"I have been to see the other overseers, Harry,\" he began, in tones\nwhich seemed to promise nothing hopeful.\"As I supposed, they are all afraid of Squire Walker.They daresn't\nsay their souls are their own.\"\"Then I must go to Jacob Wire's.\"\"The other overseers declare, if the squire says so, you must.\"Nason,\" replied Harry, not much disappointed\nat the result.Perhaps you might try the place, and then, if\nyou found you couldn't stand it we might make another trial to get you\noff.\"\"I don't want to go there, anyhow.I should like to help duck the\nsquire in the horse pond.\"\"Well, Harry, I have done all I can for you,\" continued Mr.Nason,\nseating himself on a keg on the barn floor.\"You have been very good to me, Mr.I shall always remember you\nas the best friend I ever had,\" replied Harry, the tears streaming\ndown his sun-browned cheeks.\"Never mind that, Harry; don't cry.\"\"I can't help it; you have been so good to me, that I hate to leave\nyou,\" blubbered Harry.\"I am sorry you must leave us; we shall miss you about the place, and\nI wish it was so that you could stay.But what makes it ten times\nworse is the idea of your going to Jacob Wire's.\"Nason,\" said Harry, dashing down his tears, and looking earnestly\nat the keeper, \"I have made up my mind that I won't go to Wire's\nanyhow.\"\"I don't blame you; but I don't see how you can fight the squire.He\ncarries too many guns for you, or for me, either, for that matter.I\nhave been thinking of something, Harry, though I suppose, if I should\nspeak it out loud, it would be as much as my place here is worth.\"\"I have been thinking of something, too,\" continued Harry, with a good\ndeal of emphasis.Nason, sympathizing deeply with his young friend, did not attempt\nto obtain any knowledge whose possession might be inconvenient to him.He was disposed to help the boy escape the fate in store for him; but\nat the same time, having a family to support, he did not wish to lose\nhis situation, though, if the emergency had demanded it, he would\nprobably have been willing to make even this sacrifice.\"I was thinking, Harry, how astonished the squire would be, when he\ncomes over in the morning to take you to Jacob Wire's, if he should\nnot happen to find you here.\"\"I dare say he would,\" answered Harry, with a meaning smile.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.\"By the way, have you heard from Charles Smith lately?You know he\nwent to Boston last spring, and they say he has got a place, and is\ndoing first rate there.\"The keeper smiled as he spoke, and Harry understood him as well as\nthough he had spoken out the real thought that was in his mind.\"I suppose others might do as he has done.\"Nason took from his pocket the large shot bag purse, in which he\nkept his change, and picked out four quarters.\"Here, Harry, take these; when you get over to Wire's, money will keep\nyou from starving.exclaimed Harry, as he took the four quarters.\"You have been a father to me, and one of these days I shall be able\nto pay you this money back again.\"Keep it; and I wish I had a\nhundred times as much to give you.\"I shall be a man one of these\ndays, and we shall meet again.\"Harry felt the spirit of a\nman stirring within him.He felt that the world had cast him off, and\nrefused him a home, even in the poorhouse.He was determined to push\nhis way through life like a hero, and he nerved himself to meet\nwhatever hardships and trials might be apportioned to him.After supper he went to his room, gathered up the few articles of\nclothing which constituted his wardrobe, and tying them up in a\nbundle, concealed them in a hollow stump back of the barn.At eight o'clock he went to bed as usual.He felt no desire to sleep,\nand would not have dared to do so if he had.He heard the old kitchen\nclock strike ten.The house was still, for all had long ago retired to\ntheir rest, and he could hear the sonorous snores of the paupers in\nthe adjoining rooms.It was a\nnovel position in which he found himself.He had been accustomed to do\neverything fairly and \"above board,\" and the thought of rising from\nhis bed and sneaking out of the house like a thief was repulsive to\nhim.But it was a good cause, in his estimation, and he did not waste\nmuch sentiment upon the matter.A conspiracy had been formed to cheat\nhim of his hopes and of his future happiness, and it seemed right to\nhim that he should flee from those with whom he could not successfully\ncontend.Carefully and stealthily he crept out of bed, and put on his best\nclothes, which were nothing to boast of at that, for there was many a\ndarn and many a patch upon the jacket and trousers.Stockings and\nshoes were luxuries in which Harry was not indulged in the warm\nseason; but he had a pair of each, which he took under his arm.Like a mouse he crept down stairs, and reached the back door of the\nhouse without having disturbed any of its inmates.There were no locks\non the poorhouse doors, for burglars and thieves never invaded the\nhome of the stricken, forsaken paupers.The door opened with a sharp creak, and Harry was sure he was\ndetected.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.For several minutes he waited, but no sound was heard, and\nmore carefully he opened the door wide enough to permit his passage\nout.He was now in the open air, and a sensation of relief pervaded his\nmind.No man was his master in this world, and he had not\nlearned to think much of the other world.As he passed through the cow\nyard he heard the old gray mare whinny, and he could not resist the\ntemptation to pay her a parting visit.They had been firm friends for\nyears, and as he entered the barn she seemed to recognize him in the\ndarkness.I am going away to leave you,\" said Harry, in low\ntones, as he patted the mare upon her neck.Nason, you have been my best friend.The mare whinnied again, as though she perfectly comprehended this\naffectionate speech, and wished to express her sympathy with her young\nfriend in her own most eloquent language.Perhaps Harry could not\nrender", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "\"Good-by, old Prue; but, before I go, I shall give you one more feed\nof oats--the very last.\"The localities of the barn were as familiar to him as those of his own\nchamber; and taking the half peck measure, he filled it heaping full\nof oats at the grain chest as readily as though it had been clear\ndaylight.\"Here, Prue, is the last feed I shall give you\"; and he emptied the\ncontents of the measure into the trough.\"Good-by, old Prue; I shall\nnever see you again.\"The mare plunged her nose deep down into the savory mess, and seemed\nfor a moment to forget her friend in the selfish gratification of her\nappetite.If she had fully realized the unpleasant fact that Harry was\ngoing, perhaps she might have been less selfish, for this was not the\nfirst time she had been indebted to him for extra rations.Passing through the barn, the runaway was again in the open air.Everything looked gloomy and sad to him, and the scene was as solemn\nas a funeral.There were no sounds to be heard but the monotonous\nchirp of the cricket, and the dismal piping of the frogs in the\nmeadow.Even the owl and the whip-poor-will had ceased their nocturnal\nnotes, and the stars looked more gloomy than he had ever seen them\nbefore.There was no time to moralize over these things, though, as he walked\nalong, he could not help thinking how strange and solemn everything\nseemed on that eventful night.It was an epoch in his history; one of\nthose turning points in human life, when all the works of nature and\nart, borrowing the spirit which pervades the soul, assume odd and\nunfamiliar forms.Harry was not old enough or wise enough to\ncomprehend the importance of the step he was taking; still he was\ndeeply impressed by the strangeness within and without.Taking his bundle from the hollow stump, he directed his steps toward\nPine Pleasant.He walked very slowly, for his feelings swelled within\nhim and retarded his steps.His imagination was busy with the past, or\nwandering vaguely to the unexplored future, which with bright promises\ntempted him to press on to the goal of prosperity.He yearned to be a\nman; to leap in an instant over the years of discipline, that yawned\nlike a great gulf between his youth and his manhood.He wanted to be a\nman, that his strong arm might strike great blows; that he might win\nhis way up to wealth and honor.Why couldn't he be a great man like Squire Walker.Squire West\nwouldn't sound bad.\"One has only to be rich in order to be great,\" thought he.\"Why can't\nI be rich, as well as anybody else?Who was that old fellow that saved\nup his fourpences till he was worth a hundred thousand dollars?I can\ndo it as well as he, though I won't be as mean as they say he was,\nanyhow.There are chances enough to get rich, and if I fail in one\nthing, why--I can try again.\"Thus Harry mused as he walked along, and fixed a definite purpose\nbefore him to be accomplished in life.It is true it was not a very\nlofty or a very noble purpose, merely to be rich; but he had been\nobliged to do his own philosophizing.He had not yet discovered the\ntrue philosopher's stone.He had concluded, like the alchemists of\nold, that it was the art of turning anything into gold.The paupers,\nin their poverty, had talked most and prayed most for that which they\nhad not.Wealth was to them the loftiest ideal of happiness, and Harry\nhad adopted their conclusions.It is not strange, therefore, that\nHarry's first resolve was to be a rich man.\"Seek ye _first_ the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be\nadded unto you,\" was a text which he had often heard repeated; but he\ndid not comprehend its meaning, and he had reversed the proposition,\ndetermined to look out for \"all these things\" first.The village clock struck eleven, and the peal of the clear notes on\nthe silent air cut short his meditations, and admonished him to\nquicken his pace, or Ben would reach the place of rendezvous before\nhim.He entered the still shades of Pine Pleasant, but saw nothing of\nhis confederate.Seating himself on the familiar rock in the river, he\nreturned to his meditations.He had hardly laid down his first proposition in solving the problem\nof his future success, before he was startled by the discovery of a\nbright light in the direction of the village.It was plainly a\nbuilding on fire, and his first impulse was to rush to the meeting\nhouse and give the alarm; but prudence forbade.His business was with\nthe great world and the future, not with Redfield and the present.A few moments later the church bell pealed its startling notes, and he\nheard the cry of fire in the village.The building, whatever it was,\nhad become a mass of fierce flames, which no human arm could stay.While he was watching the exciting spectacle, he heard footsteps in\nthe grove, and Ben Smart, out of breath and nearly exhausted, leaped\nupon the rock.\"So you are here, Harry,\" gasped he.\"We have no time to waste now,\" panted Ben, rousing himself anew.Ben descended to the lower side of the rock, and hauled a small\nflat-bottomed boat out of the bushes that grew on the river's brink.\"Never mind the fire now; jump into the boat, and let us be off.\"Harry obeyed, and Ben pushed off from the rock.asked Harry, not much pleased either with the\nimperative tone or the haughty reserve of his companion.Take the paddle and steer her; the current will take\nher along fast enough.I am so tired I can't do a thing more.\"Harry took the paddle and seated himself in the stern of the boat,\nwhile Ben, puffing and blowing like a locomotive, placed himself at\nthe bow.\"Tell me now where the fire is,\" said Harry, whose curiosity would not\nbe longer resisted.\"_Squire Walker's barn._\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER IS DIFFICULT AND\nDANGEROUS\n\n\nHarry was astounded at this information.Ben was exhausted, as though\nhe had been running very hard; besides, he was much agitated--more so\nthan the circumstances of the occasion seemed to justify.In\nconnection with the threat which his companion had uttered that day,\nthese appearances seemed to point to a solution of the burning\nbuilding.He readily understood that Ben, in revenge for the indignity\nthe squire had cast upon him, had set the barn on fire, and was now\nrunning away by the light of it.This was more than he had bargained for.However ill-natured he felt\ntowards the squire for his proposal to send him to Jacob Wire's, it\nnever occurred to him to retaliate by committing a crime.His ideas of\nChristian charity and of forgiveness were but partially developed; and\nthough he could not feel right towards his powerful enemy, he felt no\ndesire to punish him so severely as Ben had done.His companion gave him a short answer, and manifested no disposition\nto enlarge upon the subject; and for several minutes both maintained a\nprofound silence.The boat, drifting slowly with the current, was passing from the pond\ninto the narrow river, and it required all Harry's skill to keep her\nfrom striking the banks on either side.His mind was engrossed with\nthe contemplation of the new and startling event which had so suddenly\npresented itself to embarrass his future operations.Ben was a\ncriminal in the eye of the law, and would be subjected to a severe\npenalty if detected.\"I shouldn't have thought you would have done that,\" Harry observed,\nwhen the silence became painful to him.\"Well, I can see through a millstone when there is a hole in it.\"\"I didn't say I set the barn afire.\"\"I know you didn't; but you said you meant to pay the squire off for\nwhat he had done to you.\"\"I didn't say I had,\" answered Ben, who was evidently debating with\nhimself whether he should admit Harry to his confidence.\"But didn't you set the barn afire?\"\"Why, I should say you run a great risk.\"\"I see the reason now, why you wouldn't tell me what you was going to\ndo before.\"I meant to pay off the squire, and--\"\n\n\"Then you did set the barn afire?\"\"I didn't say so; and, more than that, I don't mean to say so.If you\ncan see through a millstone, why, just open your eyes--that's all.\"\"No whining, Harry; be a man.\"\"I mean to be a man; but I don't think there was any need of burning\nthe barn.\"\"I do; I couldn't leave Redfield without squaring accounts with Squire\nWalker.\"\"We will go by the river, as far as we can; then take to the road.\"\"But this is George Leman's boat--isn't it?\"\"Of course I did; you don't suppose I should mind trifles at such a\ntime as this!But he can have it again, when I have done with it.\"\"In the first place, don't you think it is easier to sail in a boat\nthan to walk?And in the second place, the river runs through the\nwoods for five or six miles below Pine Pleasant; so that no one will\nbe likely to see us.It is full of rocks about three\nmiles down.\"We can keep her clear of the rocks well enough.When I was down the river last spring, you couldn't see a single rock\nabove water, and we don't draw more than six inches.\"\"But that was in the spring, when the water was high.I don't believe\nwe can get the boat through.\"\"Yes, we can; at any rate, we can jump ashore and tow her down,\"\nreplied Ben, confidently, though his calculations were somewhat\ndisturbed by Harry's reasoning.\"There is another difficulty, Ben,\" suggested Harry.\"O, there are a hundred difficulties; but we mustn't mind them.\"\"They will miss the boat, and suspect at once who has got it.\"\"We shall be out of their reach when they miss it.\"\"I heard George Leman say he was going a fishing in her to-morrow.\"\"Because you didn't tell me what you were going to do.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.\"Never mind; it is no use to cry for spilt milk.\"That we are; and if you only stick by me, it will all come out right.If we get caught, you must keep a stiff upper lip.\"\"And, above all, don't blow on me.\"\"Whatever happens, promise that you will stick by me.\"On that, we will take a bit of luncheon,\nand have a good time of it.\"As he spoke, Ben drew out from under the seat in the bow a box filled\nwith bread and cheese.\"You see we are provisioned for a cruise, Harry,\" added Ben, as he\noffered the contents of the box to his companion.\"Here is enough to\nlast us two or three days.\"\"But you don't mean to keep on the river so long as that?\"\"I mean to stick to the boat as long as the navigation will permit,\"\nreplied Ben, with more energy than he had before manifested, for he\nwas recovering from the perturbation with which the crime he had\ncommitted filled his mind.\"There is a factory village, with a dam across the river, six or seven\nmiles below here.\"\"I know it; but perhaps we can get the boat round the dam in the night\ntime, and continue our voyage below.Don't you remember that piece in\nthe Reader about John Ledyard--how he went down the Connecticut River\nin a canoe?\"\"Yes; and you got your idea from that?\"\"I did; and I mean to have a first rate time of it.\"Ben proceeded to describe the anticipated pleasures of the river\nvoyage, as he munched his bread and cheese; and Harry listened with a\ngreat deal of satisfaction.Running away was not such a terrible\nthing, after all.It was both business and pleasure, and his\nimagination was much inflated by the brilliant prospect before him.There was something so novel and exciting in the affair, that his\nfirst experience was of the most delightful character.He forgot the crime his companion had committed, and had almost come\nto regard the burning of the squire's barn as a just and proper\nretribution upon him for conspiring against the rights and privileges\nof young America.My young readers may not know how easy it is even for a good boy to\nlearn to love the companionship of those who are vicious, and disposed\nto take the road which leads down to moral ruin and death.Those lines\nof Pope, which are familiar to almost every school boy, convey a great\ntruth, and a thrilling warning to those who first find themselves\ntaking pleasure in the society of wicked men, or wicked boys:\n\n    \"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien\n     As to be hated, needs but to be seen;\n     But seen too oft, familiar with her face,\n     We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"Now, I have not represented my hero, at this stage of the story, as a\nvery good boy, and it did not require much time to familiarize him\nwith the wickedness which was in Ben's heart, and which he did not\ntake any pains to conceal.The transition from enduring to pitying and\nfrom that to embracing was sudden and easy, if, indeed, there was any\nmiddle passage between the first and last stage.I am sorry to say that an hour's fellowship with Ben, under the\nexciting circumstances in which we find them, had led him to think Ben\na very good fellow, notwithstanding the crime he had committed.I\nshall do my young reader the justice to believe he hopes Harry will be\na better boy, and obtain higher and nobler views of duty.It must be\nremembered that Harry had never learned to \"love God and man\" on the\nknee of an affectionate mother.He had long ago forgotten the little\nprayers she had taught him, and none were said at the poorhouse.Whereupon, feeling somewhat better, she\nwent in and locked the balcony window and proceeded upstairs.There was a movement inside, the sound of a book put down.From the sounds, she judged that he was putting on his shabby gray\ncoat.The next moment he had opened the door and stepped out into the\ncorridor.I started downstairs a while ago, but you had a\nvisitor.\"He gazed down at her quizzically.He knows now that I--that I shall not marry him.\"\"I believe you think I should have married him.\"\"I am only putting myself in his place and realizing--When do you\nleave?\"Then, hurriedly:--\n\n\"I got a little present for you--nothing much, but your mother was quite\nwilling.He went back into his room, and returned with a small box.\"With all sorts of good luck,\" he said, and placed it in her hands.Because, if you would rather have something else--\"\n\nShe opened the box with excited fingers.Ticking away on its satin bed\nwas a small gold watch.\"You'll need it, you see,\" he explained nervously, \"It wasn't\nextravagant under the circumstances.Your mother's watch, which you had\nintended to take, had no second-hand.You'll need a second-hand to take\npulses, you know.\"\"A watch,\" said Sidney, eyes on it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.\"A dear little watch, to pin on and\nnot put in a pocket.\"I was afraid you might think it presumptuous,\" he said.\"I haven't any\nright, of course.I thought of flowers--but they fade and what have you?You said that, you know, about Joe's roses.And then, your mother said\nyou wouldn't be offended--\"\n\n\"Don't apologize for making me so happy!\"After that she must pin it on, and slip in to stand before his mirror\nand inspect the result.It gave Le Moyne a queer thrill to see her there\nin the room among his books and his pipes.It make him a little sick,\ntoo, in view of to-morrow and the thousand-odd to-morrows when she would\nnot be there.\"I've kept you up shamefully,'\" she said at last, \"and you get up so\nearly.I shall write you a note from the hospital, delivering a little\nlecture on extravagance--because how can I now, with this joy shining on\nme?And about how to keep Katie in order about your socks, and all sorts\nof things.She had moved to the door, and he followed her, stooping a little to\npass under the", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "\"Good-bye--and God bless you.\"She went out, and he closed the door softly behind her.CHAPTER IX\n\n\nSidney never forgot her early impressions of the hospital, although they\nwere chaotic enough at first.There were uniformed young women\ncoming and going, efficient, cool-eyed, low of voice.There were\nmedicine-closets with orderly rows of labeled bottles, linen-rooms with\ngreat stacks of sheets and towels, long vistas of shining floors and\nlines of beds.There were brisk internes with duck clothes and brass\nbuttons, who eyed her with friendly, patronizing glances.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.There were\nbandages and dressings, and great white screens behind which were played\nlittle or big dramas, baths or deaths, as the case might be.And over\nall brooded the mysterious authority of the superintendent of the\ntraining-school, dubbed the Head, for short.Twelve hours a day, from seven to seven, with the off-duty intermission,\nSidney labored at tasks which revolted her soul.She swept and\ndusted the wards, cleaned closets, folded sheets and towels, rolled\nbandages--did everything but nurse the sick, which was what she had come\nto do.She sat on the edge of her narrow white\nbed and soaked her aching feet in hot water and witch hazel, and\npracticed taking pulses on her own slender wrist, with K.Out of all the long, hot days, two periods stood out clearly, to be\nwaited for and cherished.One was when, early in the afternoon, with\nthe ward in spotless order, the shades drawn against the August sun, the\ntables covered with their red covers, and the only sound the drone of\nthe bandage-machine as Sidney steadily turned it, Dr.Max passed the\ndoor on his way to the surgical ward beyond, and gave her a cheery\ngreeting.At these times Sidney's heart beat almost in time with the\nticking of the little watch.The other hour was at twilight, when, work over for the day, the night\nnurse, with her rubber-soled shoes and tired eyes and jangling keys,\nhaving reported and received the night orders, the nurses gathered in\ntheir small parlor for prayers.It was months before Sidney got over the\nexaltation of that twilight hour, and never did it cease to bring her\nhealing and peace.In a way, it crystallized for her what the day's work\nmeant: charity and its sister, service, the promise of rest and peace.Into the little parlor filed the nurses, and knelt, folding their tired\nhands.\"The Lord is my shepherd,\" read the Head out of her worn Bible; \"I shall\nnot want.\"And the nurses: \"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth\nme beside the still waters.\"And so on through the psalm to the assurance at the end, \"And I will\ndwell in the house of the Lord forever.\"Now and then there was a death\nbehind one of the white screens.It caused little change in the routine\nof the ward.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.A nurse stayed behind the screen, and her work was done by\nthe others.When everything was over, the time was recorded exactly on\nthe record, and the body was taken away.At first it seemed to Sidney that she could not stand this nearness to\ndeath.She thought the nurses hard because they took it quietly.Then\nshe found that it was only stoicism, resignation, that they had learned.These things must be, and the work must go on.Some such patient detachment must be that of the\nangels who keep the Great Record.On her first Sunday half-holiday she was free in the morning, and went\nto church with her mother, going back to the hospital after the service.So it was two weeks before she saw Le Moyne again.Even then, it was\nonly for a short time.Christine and Palmer Howe came in to see her, and\nto inspect the balcony, now finished.But Sidney and Le Moyne had a few words together first.She was\na trifle subdued, with a puzzled look in her blue eyes.Her mouth was\ntender, as always, but he thought it drooped.There was a new atmosphere\nof wistfulness about the girl that made his heart ache.They were alone in the little parlor with its brown lamp and blue silk\nshade, and its small nude Eve--which Anna kept because it had been a\ngift from her husband, but retired behind a photograph of the minister,\nso that only the head and a bare arm holding the apple appeared above\nthe reverend gentleman.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.K. never smoked in the parlor, but by sheer force of habit he held the\npipe in his teeth.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.Aunt Harriet, who left you her love,\nhas had the complete order for the Lorenz trousseau.She and I have\npicked out a stunning design for the wedding dress.I thought I'd ask\nyou about the veil.Do you like this new\nfashion of draping the veil from behind the coiffure in the back--\"\n\nSidney had been sitting on the edge of her chair, staring.\"There,\" she said--\"I knew it!They're making an\nold woman of you already.\"\"Miss Lorenz likes the new method, but my personal preference is for the\nold way, with the bride's face covered.\"\"Katie has a new prescription--recipe--for bread.It has more bread and\nfewer air-holes.One cake of yeast--\"\n\nSidney sprang to her feet.\"Because you rent a room in\nthis house is no reason why you should give up your personality and\nyour--intelligence.But Katie has\nmade bread without masculine assistance for a good many years, and if\nChristine can't decide about her own veil she'd better not get married.Mother says you water the flowers every evening, and lock up the house\nbefore you go to bed.I--I never meant you to adopt the family!\"K. removed his pipe and gazed earnestly into the bowl.\"Bill Taft has had kittens under the porch,\" he said.\"And the\ngroceryman has been sending short weight.We've bought scales now, and\nweigh everything.\"\"Dear child, I am doing these things because I like to do them.For--for\nsome time I've been floating, and now I've got a home.Every time I\nlock up the windows at night, or cut a picture out of a magazine as a\nsuggestion to your Aunt Harriet, it's an anchor to windward.\"Sidney gazed helplessly at his imperturbable face.He seemed older than\nshe had recalled him: the hair over his ears was almost white.That was Palmer Howe's age, and Palmer seemed like a\nboy.But he held himself more erect than he had in the first days of his\noccupancy of the second-floor front.\"And now,\" he said cheerfully, \"what about yourself?You've lost a lot\nof illusions, of course, but perhaps you've gained ideals.\"Life,\" observed Sidney, with the wisdom of two weeks out in the world,\n\"life is a terrible thing, K. We think we've got it, and--it's got us.\"\"When I think of how simple I used to think it all was!One grew up and\ngot married, and--and perhaps had children.And when one got very\nold, one died.Lately, I've been seeing that life really consists of\nexceptions--children who don't grow up, and grown-ups who die before\nthey are old.And\"--this took an effort, but she looked at him\nsquarely--\"and people who have children, but are not married.\"All knowledge that is worth while hurts in the getting.\"Sidney got up and wandered around the room, touching its little familiar\nobjects with tender hands.There was this curious\nelement in his love for her, that when he was with her it took on the\nguise of friendship and deceived even himself.It was only in the lonely\nhours that it took on truth, became a hopeless yearning for the touch of\nher hand or a glance from her clear eyes.Sidney, having picked up the minister's picture, replaced it absently,\nso that Eve stood revealed in all her pre-apple innocence.\"There is something else,\" she said absently.There is a girl in the ward--\"\n\n\"A patient?\"She has had typhoid, but she is a little\nbetter.\"At first I couldn't bear to go near her.I shivered when I had to\nstraighten her bed.I--I'm being very frank, but I've got to talk this\nout with someone.I worried a lot about it, because, although at first I\nhated her, now I don't.She looked at K. defiantly, but there was no disapproval in his eyes.She'll be able to\ngo out soon.Don't you think something ought to be done to keep her\nfrom--going back?\"She was so young to face all this;\nand yet, since face it she must, how much better to have her do it\nsquarely.\"Does she want to change her mode of life?\"She\ncares a great deal for some man.The other day I propped her up in bed\nand gave her a newspaper, and after a while I found the paper on the\nfloor, and she was crying.The other patients avoid her, and it was\nsome time before I noticed it.The next day she told me that the man\nwas going to marry some one else.'He wouldn't marry me, of course,' she\nsaid; 'but he might have told me.'\"Le Moyne did his best, that afternoon in the little parlor, to provide\nSidney with a philosophy to carry her through her training.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.He told her\nthat certain responsibilities were hers, but that she could not reform\nthe world.Broad charity, tenderness, and healing were her province.\"Help them all you can,\" he finished, feeling inadequate and hopelessly\ndidactic.\"Cure them; send them out with a smile; and--leave the rest to\nthe Almighty.\"Newly facing the evil of the\nworld, she was a rampant reformer at once.Only the arrival of Christine\nand her fiance saved his philosophy from complete rout.He had time for\na question between the ring of the bell and Katie's deliberate progress\nfrom the kitchen to the front door.He stops at the door of the ward and speaks to me.It\nmakes me quite distinguished, for a probationer.Usually, you know, the\nstaff never even see the probationers.\"\"I think he is very wonderful,\" said Sidney valiantly.Christine Lorenz, while not large, seemed to fill the little room.Her\nvoice, which was frequent and penetrating, her smile, which was wide\nand showed very white teeth that were a trifle large for beauty, her\nall-embracing good nature, dominated the entire lower floor.K., who had\nmet her before, retired into silence and a corner.Young Howe smoked a\ncigarette in the hall.said Christine, and put her cheek against Sidney's.Palmer gives you a month to tire of it\nall; but I said--\"\n\n\"I take that back,\" Palmer spoke indolently from the corridor.\"There\nis the look of willing martyrdom in her face.I've\nbrought some nuts for him.\"\"Reginald is back in the woods again.\"\"Now, look here,\" he said solemnly.\"When we arranged about these rooms,\nthere were certain properties that went with them--the lady next door\nwho plays Paderewski's 'Minuet' six hours a day, and K. here, and\nReginald.If you must take something to the woods, why not the minuet\nperson?\"Howe was a good-looking man, thin, smooth-shaven, aggressively well\ndressed.This Sunday afternoon, in a cutaway coat and high hat, with\nan English malacca stick, he was just a little out of the picture.The\nStreet said that he was \"wild,\" and that to get into the Country Club\nset Christine was losing more than she was gaining.Christine had stepped out on the balcony, and was speaking to K. just\ninside.\"It's rather a queer way to live, of course,\" she said.\"But Palmer is a\npauper, practically.We are going to take our meals at home for a while.You see, certain things that we want we can't have if we take a house--a\ncar, for instance.We'll need one for running out to the Country Club to\ndinner.Of course, unless father gives me one for a wedding present, it\nwill be a cheap one.And we're getting the Rosenfeld boy to drive it.He's crazy about machinery, and he'll come for practically nothing.\"K. had never known a married couple to take two rooms and go to the\nbride's mother's for meals in order to keep a car.Also, certain sophistries of his former world about a cheap\nchauffeur being costly in the end rose in his mind and were carefully\nsuppressed.\"You'll find a car a great comfort, I'm sure,\" he said politely.She liked his graying hair\nand steady eyes, and insisted on considering his shabbiness a pose.She\nwas conscious that she made a pretty picture in the French window, and\npreened herself like a bright bird.\"You'll come out with us now and then, I hope.\"\"Isn't it odd to think that we are going to be practically one family!\"He caught the flash of Christine's smile, and smiled back.Christine was\nglad she had decided to take the rooms, glad that K. lived there.This\nthing of marriage being the end of all things was absurd.A married\nwoman should have men friends; they kept her up.She would take him to\nthe Country Club.Across the Street, the Rosenfeld boy had stopped by Dr.Wilson's car,\nand was eyeing it with the cool, appraising glance of the street\nboy whose sole knowledge of machinery has been acquired from the\nclothes-washer at home.Joe Drummond, eyes carefully ahead, went up the\nStreet.McKee's, stood in the doorway and fanned herself\nwith her apron.Max Wilson came out of the house and got into his car.For a minute, perhaps, all the actors, save Carlotta and Dr.It was that bete noir of the playwright, an ensemble; K. Le\nMoyne and Sidney, Palmer Howe, Christine, Tillie, the younger Wilson,\nJoe, even young Rosenfeld, all within speaking distance, almost touching\ndistance, gathered within and about the little house on a side street\nwhich K. at first grimly and now tenderly called \"home.\"CHAPTER X\n\n\nOn Monday morning, shortly after the McKee prolonged breakfast was over,\na small man of perhaps fifty, with iron-gray hair and a sparse goatee,\nmade his way along the Street.He moved with the air of one having a\ndefinite destination but a by no means definite reception.As he walked along he eyed with a professional glance the ailanthus and\nmaple trees which, with an occasional poplar, lined the Street.Owing to a slight change\nin the grade of the street, the McKee house had no stoop, but one flat\ndoorstep.Thus it was possible to ring the doorbell from the pavement,\nand this the stranger did.It gave him a curious appearance of being\nready to cut and run if things were unfavorable.She recognized him at once, but no smile met the nervous one\nthat formed itself on the stranger's face.\"I was thinking, as I came along,\" he said, \"that you and the neighbors\nhad better get after these here caterpillars.\"If you want to see Tillie, she's busy.\"\"I only want to say how-d 'ye-do.A certain doggedness took the place of his tentative smile.\"I'll say it to myself, I guess.I don't want any unpleasantness, but\nI've come a good ways to see her and I'll hang around until I do.\"McKee knew herself routed, and retreated to the kitchen.Only, my advice to you is, don't be a fool.\"The hands with which she tied a white apron\nover her gingham one were shaking.Her visitor had accepted the open door as permission to enter and was\nstanding in the hall.He went rather white himself when he saw Tillie coming toward him down\nthe hall.He knew that for Tillie this visit would mean that he was\nfree--and he was not free.Sheer terror of his errand filled him.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.said poor Tillie, with the\nquestion in her eyes.\"I was passing through, and I just thought I'd call around and tell\nyou--My God, Tillie, I'm glad to see you!\"She made no reply, but opened the door into the cool and, shaded little\nparlor.He followed her in and closed the door behind him", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Playing with paper dolls--that's the latest.\"Tillie sat down suddenly on one of the stiff chairs.Her lips were as\nwhite as her face.\"I thought, when I saw you--\"\n\n\"I was afraid you'd think that.\"Tillie's hands twisted nervously in her lap.Schwitter's eyes were fixed on the window, which looked back on the\nMcKee yard.\"That spiraea back there's not looking very good.If you'll save the\ncigar butts around here and put them in water, and spray it, you'll kill\nthe lice.\"\"I don't know why you come around bothering me,\" she said dully.\"I've\nbeen getting along all right; now you come and upset everything.\"Schwitter rose and took a step toward her.\"Well, I'll tell you why I came.I ain't getting any\nyounger, am I?Time's going on, and I'm wanting you all the time.What've I got out of life, anyhow?\"You're lonely, too, ain't you?\"And, anyhow, there's always a crowd\nhere.\"\"You can be lonely in a crowd, and I guess--is there any one around here\nyou like better than me?\"\"We can talk our heads off and\nnot get anywhere.You've got a wife living, and, unless you intend to do\naway with her, I guess that's all there is to it.\"Haven't you got a right to be happy?\"She was quick of wit, and she read his tone as well as his words.\"You get out of here--and get out quick!\"She had jumped to her feet; but he only looked at her with understanding\neyes.\"That's the way I thought of it at first.Maybe I've\njust got used to the idea, but it doesn't seem so bad to me now.Here\nare you, drudging for other people when you ought to have a place all\nyour own--and not gettin' younger any more than I am.I'd be a good husband to you, Till--because, whatever it'd be in\nlaw, I'd be your husband before God.\"Tillie cowered against the door, her eyes on his.Here before her,\nembodied in this man, stood all that she had wanted and never had.He\nmeant a home, tenderness, children, perhaps.He turned away from the\nlook in her eyes and stared out of the front window.\"Them poplars out there ought to be taken away,\" he said heavily.Tillie found her voice at last:--\n\n\"I couldn't do it, Mr.\"Perhaps, if you got used to the idea--\"\n\n\"What's that to do with the right and wrong of it?\"It seems to\nme that the Lord would make an exception of us if He knew the\ncircumstances.Perhaps, after you get used to the idea--What I thought\nwas like this.I've got a little farm about seven miles from the city\nlimits, and the tenant on it says that nearly every Sunday somebody\nmotors out from town and wants a chicken-and-waffle supper.There ain't\nmuch in the nursery business anymore.These landscape fellows buy their\nstuff direct, and the middleman's out.I've got a good orchard, and\nthere's a spring, so I could put running water in the house.I'd be good\nto you, Tillie,--I swear it.\"Don't a man respect a woman that's got courage enough to give up\neverything for him?\"Tillie was crying softly into her apron.He put a work-hardened hand on\nher head.\"It isn't as if I'd run around after women,\" he said.\"You're the only\none, since Maggie--\" He drew a long breath.\"I'll give you time to think\nit over.Suppose I stop in to-morrow morning.It doesn't commit you to\nanything to talk it over.\"There had been no passion in the interview, and there was none in\nthe touch of his hand.He was not young, and the tragic loneliness of\napproaching old age confronted him.He was trying to solve his problem\nand Tillie's, and what he had found was no solution, but a compromise.\"To-morrow morning, then,\" he said quietly, and went out the door.All that hot August morning Tillie worked in a daze.McKee watched\nher and said nothing.She interpreted the girl's white face and set lips\nas the result of having had to dismiss Schwitter again, and looked for\ntime to bring peace, as it had done before.Le Moyne came late to his midday meal.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.For once, the mental anaesthesia\nof endless figures had failed him.On his way home he had drawn his\nsmall savings from the bank, and mailed them, in cash and registered, to\na back street in the slums of a distant city.He had done this before,\nand always with a feeling of exaltation, as if, for a time at least,\nthe burden he carried was lightened.But to-day he experienced no\ncompensatory relief.Life was dull and stale to him, effort ineffectual.At thirty a man should look back with tenderness, forward with hope.K.\nLe Moyne dared not look back, and had no desire to look ahead into empty\nyears.Although he ate little, the dining-room was empty when he finished.Usually he had some cheerful banter for Tillie, to which she responded\nin kind.But, what with the heat and with heaviness of spirit, he did\nnot notice her depression until he rose.\"Why, you're not sick, are you, Tillie?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.If I send you two tickets to a\nroof garden where there's a variety show, can't you take a friend and go\nto-night?\"\"Thanks;

law and creed and early training were\nfighting against the strongest instinct of the race.CHAPTER XI\n\n\nThe hot August days dragged on.Merciless sunlight beat in through the\nslatted shutters of ward windows.At night, from the roof to which the\nnurses retired after prayers for a breath of air, lower surrounding\nroofs were seen to be covered with sleepers.Children dozed precariously\non the edge of eternity; men and women sprawled in the grotesque\npostures of sleep.There was a sort of feverish irritability in the air.Even the nurses,\nstoically unmindful of bodily discomfort, spoke curtly or not at all.Miss Dana, in Sidney's ward, went down with a low fever, and for a day\nor so Sidney and Miss Grange got along as best they could.Sidney worked\nlike two or more, performed marvels of bed-making, learned to give\nalcohol baths for fever with the maximum of result and the minimum\nof time, even made rounds with a member of the staff and came through\ncreditably.Ed Wilson had sent a woman patient into the ward, and his visits\nwere the breath of life to the girl.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Some of them will\ntry to take it out of you.It's been hot, and of course it's troublesome to tell\nme everything.I--I think they're all very kind.\"He reached out a square, competent hand, and put it over hers.\"We miss you in the Street,\" he said.\"It's all sort of dead there since\nyou left.Joe Drummond doesn't moon up and down any more, for one thing.What was wrong between you and Joe, Sidney?\"\"I didn't want to marry him; that's all.\"Then, seeing her face:--\n\n\"But you're right, of course.Don't marry anyone unless you can't live\nwithout him.That's been my motto, and here I am, still single.\"During the lonely times when Max was at college and in Europe, he had\nwatched her grow from a child to a young girl.He did not suspect for\na moment that in that secret heart of hers he sat newly enthroned, in\na glow of white light, as Max's brother; that the mere thought that\nhe lived in Max's house (it was, of course Max's house to her), sat at\nMax's breakfast table, could see him whenever he wished, made the touch\nof his hand on hers a benediction and a caress.Sidney finished folding linen and went back to the ward.Almost every bed had its visitor beside it; but\nSidney, running an eye over the ward, found the girl of whom she had\nspoken to Le Moyne quite alone.She was propped up in bed, reading; but\nat each new step in the corridor hope would spring into her eyes and die\nagain.If these people would only get out and let me read\nin peace--Say, sit down and talk to me, won't you?It beats the mischief\nthe way your friends forget you when you're laid up in a place like\nthis.\"\"A girl I knew was sick here last year, and it wasn't too hot for me to\ntrot in twice a week with a bunch of flowers for her.Do you think she's\nbeen here once?Then, suddenly:--\n\n\"You know that man I told you about the other day?\"\"It was a shock to me, that's all.I didn't want you to think I'd break\nmy heart over any fellow.All I meant was, I wished he'd let me know.\"They looked unnaturally large and somber in\nher face.Her hair had been cut short, and her nightgown, open at the\nneck, showed her thin throat and prominent clavicles.\"You're from the city, aren't you, Miss Page?\"\"You told me the street, but I've forgotten it.\"Sidney repeated the name of the Street, and slipped a fresh pillow under\nthe girl's head.\"The evening paper says there's a girl going to be married on your\nstreet.\"A friend of mine is going to be married.I--I don't remember the man's name.\"I suppose you'll be going to that wedding?\"\"If I ever get time to have a dress made, I'll surely go.\"Toward six o'clock the next morning, the night nurse was making out her\nreports.On one record, which said at the top, \"Grace Irving, age 19,\"\nand an address which, to the initiated, told all her story, the night\nnurse wrote:--\n\n\"Did not sleep at all during night.Face set and eyes staring, but\ncomplains of no pain.Carlotta Harrison, back from her vacation, reported for duty the next\nmorning, and was assigned to E ward, which was Sidney's.She gave Sidney\na curt little nod, and proceeded to change the entire routine with the\nthoroughness of a Central American revolutionary president.Sidney, who\nhad yet to learn that with some people authority can only assert itself\nby change, found herself confused, at sea, half resentful.Once she ventured a protest:--\n\n\"I've been taught to do it that way, Miss Harrison.If my method is\nwrong, show me what you want, and I'll do my best.\"\"I am not responsible for what you have been taught.And you will not\nspeak back when you are spoken to.\"Small as the incident was, it marked a change in Sidney's position\nin the ward.She got the worst off-duty of the day, or none.Small\nhumiliations were hers: late meals, disagreeable duties, endless and\noften unnecessary tasks.Even Miss Grange, now reduced to second place,\nremonstrated with her senior.\"I think a certain amount of severity is good for a probationer,\" she\nsaid, \"but you are brutal, Miss Harrison.\"She's going to be one of the best nurses in\nthe house.\"Wilson's pet\nprobationer, that I don't always say 'please' when I ask her to change a\nbed or take a temperature.\"Miss Grange was not lacking in keenness.She died not go to the Head,\nwhich is unethical under any circumstances; but gradually there spread\nthrough the training-school a story that Carlotta Harrison was jealous\nof the new Page girl, Dr.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.Things were still highly\nunpleasant in the ward, but they grew much better when Sidney was off\nduty.She was asked to join a small class that was studying French at\nnight.As ignorant of the cause of her popularity as of the reason of\nher persecution, she went steadily on her way.For the first time, she was facing problems and\ndemanding an answer.Why must there be Grace Irvings in the world?Why\nmust the healthy babies of the obstetric ward go out to the slums and\ncome back, in months or years, crippled for the great fight by the\nhandicap of their environment, rickety, tuberculous, twisted?Why need\nthe huge mills feed the hospitals daily with injured men?And there were other things that she thought of.Every night, on her\nknees in the nurses' parlor at prayers, she promised, if she were\naccepted as a nurse, to try never to become calloused, never to regard\nher patients as \"cases,\" never to allow the cleanliness and routine of\nher ward to delay a cup of water to the thirsty, or her arms to a sick\nchild.On the whole, the world was good, she found.And, of all the good things\nin it, the best was service.True, there were hot days and restless\nnights, weary feet, and now and then a heartache.But to offset these there was the sound of Dr.Max's step\nin the corridor, and his smiling nod from the door; there was a \"God\nbless you\" now and then for the comfort she gave; there were wonderful\nnights on the roof under the stars, until K.While Sidney watched the stars from her hospital roof, while all around\nher the slum children, on other roofs, fought for the very breath of\nlife, others who knew and loved her watched the stars, too.K. was\nhaving his own troubles in those days.Late at night, when Anna and\nHarriet had retired, he sat on the balcony and thought of many things.He had noticed that her lips were rather blue,\nand had called in Dr.Anna was not to\nbe told, or Sidney.\"Sidney can't help any,\" said Harriet, \"and for Heaven's sake let her\nhave her chance.If you tell her anything at all, she'll have Sidney here, waiting on her\nhand and foot.\"And Le Moyne, fearful of urging too much because his own heart was\ncrying out to have the girl back, assented.The boy did not seem to get over the\nthing the way he should.Now and then Le Moyne, resuming his old habit\nof wearying himself into sleep, would walk out into the country.On one\nsuch night he had overtaken Joe, tramping along with his head down.Joe had not wanted his company, had plainly sulked.Better do so, and you will then be more likely to get a good\ncatch and full stand.Blue grass is very good for hogs, but it is improved by the addition of\nclover.C.

did not take the\npapers, and had not heard anything about the disease here or in England.Then I explained to him, as best I could, its nature, contagious\ncharacter, etc., and having a PRAIRIE FARMER in my pocket, read him your\nbrief history of the ailment in Great Britain.Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question\nabout buying cattle and sheep at the stock yards?Just this, I replied:\nevery day there are arrivals at the stock yards of many thousands of\ncattle from these infected States.Perhaps some of them come from the very\ncounties where this disease is known to exist.The disease may break out\nany day in scores of places in all these States.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.It may appear--indeed is\nquite likely to do so at the stock yards.For aught I know it may be there\nnow.The cattle brokers will not be very likely to make known such an\nunwelcome fact a minute sooner than they are obliged to.In fact, from\nwhat they have lately been saying about the absurdity of new and stringent\nenactments concerning animal diseases, I conclude they will labor to\nconceal cases that may really exist.Now you go there to pick up cattle to\nconsume your pasturage this spring and summer, and don't you see you run\nthe risk of taking to your home and neighborhood a disease that may cost\nyou and your neighbors many thousands of dollars?If I were you I would\npick up the stock I want in my own neighborhood and county, even though\nnot exactly the kind I would like to have, and though it would cost me a\ngreat deal more time and trouble.You see to a Man of the Prairie things\nlook a little squally in this cattle business.We have all got to be\ncareful about this thing.We have a terrible enemy at our stable doors and\npasture gates, and we must guard them well.I am not an alarmist, but I\nwould run any time, almost, rather than get licked, and I have always\ntried to keep a lock on the stable door before the horse is stolen.I am\nin favor of _in_-trenchment.Perhaps my advice to my neighbor was not\nsound, but according to the light I have, I have no desire to recall it\ntill I hear more from the infected districts.To show the difference between the winter in Colorado and the States this\nway and further west, the Farmer, of Denver, mentions the fact that it\nknows a farmer who has had about two hundred acres of new land broken\nbetween the middle of November and the first of March.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Still, these\nEastern States have advantages which render them rather pleasant to live\nin.Our farmers find plenty of time in fall and spring in which to do\ntheir plowing and sowing, and our severe winters don't seem to hurt the\nground a bit.In fact, I suppose it has got used to them, sort of\nacclimated, as it were.We have pretty good markets, low railway fares,\ngood schools and plenty of them, and we manage to enjoy ourselves just as\nwell as though we could hitch up to the plow and do our breaking in\nDecember and January.We can't all go to Colorado, Dakota, Montana, or\nWashington Territory, nor to those other Edens at the South and Southwest\nwhere a man, so far as winter is concerned, may work about every day in\nthe year; but don't do so any more than we here at the North where we have\nthe excuse of severe weather for our laziness between November and April.I like Colorado and Wyoming, Arkansas and Texas, Alabama and Florida--for\nother people who like to make their homes there, but my home is here and I\nlike it.\"I don't _have_ to\" plow in winter, and I don't need to.I am\ngoing to try to do my duty and be happy where I am, believing Heaven to be\njust as near Illinois as any other State or any Territory.I read in the dispatches this morning that the barns on a ranch near Omaha\nburned the other night.With the barns were consumed twenty-six cows,\neighteen horses, 1,000 bushels of corn and a large lot of hay and oats.In\nall the loss amounted to above $10,000 and there was no insurance.From\nall over the country and at all times of the year I read almost daily of\nsimilar losses varying from $100 up into the thousands, and the closing\nsentence of about nine out of ten of these announcements is \"no\ninsurance.\"Now I am neither an insurance agent nor a lightning rod\npeddler, but there are two luxuries that I indulge in all the time, and\nthese are an insurance policy to fairly cover my farm buildings and their\ncontents, and what I believe to be well constructed lightning rods in\nsufficient number to protect the property from electric eccentricities.True, my buildings have never suffered from fire or lightning and these\nluxuries have cost me no inconsiderable amount of cash, but this money has\nbrought me relief from a heap of anxiety, for I know in case my property\nis swept away I am not left stripped and powerless to provide for my\nfamily, and I know that it will not be necessary to mortgage the farm to\nfurnish them a shelter.I don't take _cheap_ insurance either, but invest\nmy money in the policy of a company which I believe has abundant capital\nand is cautiously managed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.A wealthy man can take his fire risks in his\nown hands if he chooses, but for a man of small or moderate means it seems\nto me the height of folly to do so.I would rather go without tobacco or\n\"biled shirts\" than insurance and lightning rods.I don't know that an American farmer ever had the gout.Certainly I never\nheard of such a case.If one does get the ailment, however, if he keeps\nbees he always has a sure remedy at hand.A German has discovered that if\na bee is allowed to sting the affected part, a cure is instantaneous.Why\ndon't Bismarck try this home remedy for his complication of gout and\ntrichinae?REMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the\nsubscriber gets a copy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, FREE!_This is the most liberal offer ever made by any first-class\nweekly agricultural paper in this country._\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: Poultry Notes.]One of my correspondents writes: \"My hens don't eat well--they just pick\nover the food as if it were not good enough for them--and they don't lay\nwell; in fact they don't do much of anything except to mope about--not as\nif sick, but as if lazy.\"Probably you have fed the same thing every day for the last six months,\nand the hens are getting tired of it.Hens are like other people--they\nlike a change of provender once in awhile--especially when confined\nindoors.Sometimes over-feeding will cause indigestion, and then the\nbiddies will exhibit the symptoms you describe.In either case, let the\nfowls fast for a whole day, and then for a few days feed lightly with food\nthat is different from what they have been living on.Give plenty of green\nfood, also Douglas' mixture in the drinking water twice a week.Another correspondent wants to know why I always advise giving cooked food\nto fowls and chicks when uncooked food is the natural diet.I advise cooked food because experience has taught me that it is much\nbetter for poultry than the raw articles would be.Because raw bugs and\nworms constitute the \"natural diet\" of fowls in their wild state, it does\nnot follow that raw meal and potatoes would be the best and most\neconomical food for our domestic fowls.Other things being equal, chicks\nthat are fed on cooked food grow fatter, are less liable to disease, and\nthrive better generally than those who worry along on uncooked rations.If you are short of sitting hens and don't own an incubator, make the hens\ndo double duty.Set two or more at the same time, and when the chicks come\nout, give two families to one hen, and set the other over again.To do\nthis successfully, the chicks must be taken from the nest as soon as dry\nand given to the hen that is to raise them; for if a hen once leaves the\nnest with her chicks, no amount of moral suasion will induce her to go\nback.Before giving the hen fresh eggs, the nest should be renovated and\nthe hen dusted with sulphur or something to prevent lice.A lady who commenced raising thoroughbred poultry last season writes me\nthat she proposes to sell eggs for hatching this season, and asks for\ninformation about advertising, packing eggs, etc.The advertising is easy enough: all you have to do is to write a copy of\nyour \"ad.,\" send it to THE PRAIRIE FARMER and other papers that circulate\namong farmers, pay the bills, and answer the postals and letters as they\ncome.But if I were in your shoes, I would \"put my foot down\" on the\npostals to begin with; they don't amount to anything anyway; the people\nwho ask a long string of questions on a postal card are not, as a rule,\nthe ones who become customers.Before we went into the poultry business an\nold poultry-breeder said: \"Don't have anything to do with postals, it\ndon't pay.\"We thought differently, but to satisfy ourselves, we kept\ntrack of the postals, and to-day I have the addresses of over 300 people\nwho wrote us on postal cards.Just one, and he was an Ohio man.When I go into that branch of the\npoultry business again, my advertisements will contain a postscript which\nwill read thusly: \"No postals answered.\"And you need not expect that every letter will mean business; people who\nhave not the remotest idea of buying eggs will write and ask your prices,\netc., and you must answer them all alike.Here is where circulars save\nlots of work and postage.I have sent you by mail what I call a model\ncircular, and from that you can get up something to fit your case.Pack\nyour eggs in baskets in cut straw or chaff, first wrapping each egg\nseparately in paper.The eggs should not touch each other or the basket.Put plenty of packing on top, and with a darning needle and stout twine\nsew on a cover of stout cotton cloth.For the address use shipping tags,\nor else mark it plainly on the white cotton cover; I prefer the latter\nway.A day or two before you ship the eggs send a postal telling your\ncustomer when to look for them; that's all that postals are good for.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Concerning the duplicating of orders in cases of failure of the eggs to\nhatch, I quote from one of my old circulars: \"I guarantee to furnish fresh\neggs, true to name, from pure-bred, standard fowls, packed to carry safely\nany distance.In cases of total failure, when the eggs have been properly\ncared for and set within two weeks after arrival, orders will be\nduplicated free of charge.\"I furnished just what I promised, and when a\ntotal failure was reported I sent the second sitting free--though\nsometimes I felt sure that the eggs were not properly cared for, and once\na man reported a failure when, as I afterwards learned, eight eggs of the\nfirst sitting hatched.But, generally speaking, my customers were pretty\nwell satisfied.It sometimes happens that only one or two eggs out of a\nsitting will hatch, and naturally the customer feels that he has not\nreceived the worth of his money.In such cases, if both parties are\nwilling to do just what is right, the matter can be arranged so that all\nwill be satisfied.And you will sometimes get hold of a customer that\nnothing under the heavens will satisfy; when this happens, do just exactly\nas you would wish to be done by, and there let the matter end.If the lady who wrote from Carroll county, Illinois, concerning an\nincubator, will write again and give the name of her postoffice, she will\nreceive a reply by mail.Although yesterday was very cold and inclement, to-day (March 11th) is\nwarm and pleasant, and bees that are wintered upon their summer stands\nwill be upon the wing.It would be well on such days as this to see that\nall entrances to hives are open, so that no hindrances may be in the way\nof house-cleaning.This is all we think necessary for this month, provided\nthey have plenty of stores to last until flowers bloom.Handling bees\ntends to excite them to brood rearing, and veterans in bee-culture claim\nthat this uses up the vitality of bees in spring very fast.Although more\nyoung may be reared, it is at the risk of the old ones, as they leave the\nhive in search of water; many thus perish, which often results in the\ndeath of the colony, as the young perish for want of nurses.Sometimes,\nalso, in handling bees early in the season the queens are lost, as they\nmay fall upon the ground, yet chilled, and perish.Bees consume food very fast while rearing brood; naturalists tells us that\ninsects during the larvae state consume more food than they do during the\nremainder of their existence.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Where a bee-keeper has been so improvident\nas to neglect to provide abundance of stores for his bees he should\nexamine them carefully, and if found wanting, remove an empty frame,\nsubstituting a full one in its place.Where frames of honey are not to be\nhad, liquid honey and sugar can be kneaded together, forming cakes, which\ncan be placed over the cluster.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Care should be taken that no apertures are\nleft, thus forming a way for cold drafts through the hive.These cakes are\nthought to excite bees less than when liquid food is given; they have\nanother advantage, also, viz., bees can cluster upon them while feeding,\nand do not get chilled.Bees that have been wintered in cell", "question": "Where is Daniel?

L. Langstroth will be pained to learn that\nhe has a severe attack of his old malady and unable to do any mental work.May the Lord deal kindly and gently with him.During the last fall and winter he has been the light of many conventions,\nand it will be remembered as a pleasant episode in the lives of many\nbee-keepers that they had the privilege of viewing his beaming\ncountenance, hearing the words of wisdom as they escaped from his lips,\nand taking the hand of this truly great and good man.L. HARRISON\n\n\nExtracted Honey.A couple of copies of THE PRAIRIE FARMER have lately come to my desk, a\nreminder of my boyhood days, when, in the old home with my father, I used\nto contribute an article now and then to its columns.There is an old\nscrap-book on the shelf, at my right, now, with some of those articles in\nit, published nearly thirty years ago.But my object in writing now is to\nadd something to Mrs.Last year my\nhoney crop was about 3,000 pounds, and half of this was extracted, or\nslung honey, as we bee-keepers often call it; but for next year I have\ndecided to raise nearly all comb honey, for the reason that I do not get\ncustomers so readily for extracted honey.I have never extracted until the\nhoney was all, or nearly all, capped over, and then admitted air into the\nvessels holding it, so as to be absolutely sure of getting it \"dry,\" and\nproof against souring.This method has given me about half the amount\nothers obtained by extracting as soon as the combs were filled by the\nbees, and ripening afterward.But in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against\nextracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to\nthis sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees\nthemselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that\nwhile my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have\nseveral ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an\nabsolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs.When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean\nthat all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey\nI have ever had never candied at all.In one case I knew the honey to\ncandy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,\nparticularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all.This difference\nseems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will\ncrystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey\nmerchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose\nwith honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.CAMM., MORGAN CO., ILL.South'n Wisconsin Bee-keepers' Ass'n.The bee-keepers met in Janesville, Wis., on the 4th inst., and organized a\npermanent society, to be known as the Southern Wisconsin Bee-keepers'\nAssociation.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.The following named persons were elected officers for the\nensuing year: President, C.

S.\nPennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: \"Many thanks for your\ninstructive articles on Silk Culture.Could the many miles of Osage orange\nfound in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give\nemployment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means\nthey could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting.I hope that\nyou will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this\nsubject.\"Anent this subject we find the following by Prof.C. V. Riley in a late\nissue of the American Naturalist:\n\n\"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making\nmoney by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use\nof Osage orange as silk-worm food.We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the\nmost careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is\nproperly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in\nquantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has\nbeen fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without\ndeterioration.There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if\nanything, must be looked upon as an advantage.It is more than likely, how\never, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the\nMaclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from\nMorus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in\nsome depreciation.Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,\nhas completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,\nwhich he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and\nManufacturer's Gazette.The race\nknown as the \"Var\" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves.The \"Pyrenean\"\nand \"Cevennes\" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage\norange, while the \"Milanese\" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second\nmolt and then changed to mulberry leaves.At the close examples of each\nvariety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,\nand appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per\npound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per\npound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between\nMaclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per\ncent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the\nOsage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of\nthe worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding\nduring the last three ages.'The experiment, although interesting, is not\nconclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the\ndifferent tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been\ndue, to a certain extent, to race and not to food.\"A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the\nhead of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two\nbricks, is an effective remedy for cramps.Patients who have suffered at\nnight, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,\ncertain, and permanent relief.California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,\nand is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea\nwater is carried on to any considerable extent.This industry has\nincreased rapidly during the last twenty years.The production has risen\nfrom 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is\nshown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following\nschools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute\nat Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'\nschools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for\nbasket weavers, and fourteen for lace making.Besides these there are the\nfollowing trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,\nendowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for\nwatchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument\nmakers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one\nfor machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,\nthree for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,\nfour for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork.There are,\nmoreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight\nagricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr.Raydt, of\nHanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid\nas a motive agent.Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is\nreduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates\nand expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before.It\nis by", "question": "Where is John?

Y.[Illustration of trees]\n\nFOREST TREES.Thus the battle of Shiloh\nopened.When the first shots were fired, Preston Johnston, son of the\nConfederate commander, looked at his watch, and it was just fourteen\nminutes past five o'clock.This little advance band must have made a brave fight, for Major\nHardcastle, in command of the Confederate outposts, reports that he\nfought a thousand men an hour.It was after six o'clock when the general\nadvance of the whole Confederate army commenced, and the pickets along\nthe line of Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions were driven in.Preston\nJohnston states that it was seven o'clock when the first cannon shot was\nfired.It was eight o'clock before the engagement became general along\nthe whole line, and at that time portions of Prentiss' division had been\nfighting for nearly three hours.General Grant was at breakfast in Savannah, nine miles away, when he was\nstartled by the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh.Hastily\nwriting an order to General Nelson to procure a guide and march his\ndivision up the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, Grant left\nhis breakfast half-eaten, and boarding his dispatch boat was soon\nsteaming up the river.His fear was that the isolated division of\nGeneral Lewis Wallace, which lay at Crump's Landing, had been attacked.Finding this not to be the case when he reached Crump's, he bade Wallace\nhold his division in readiness and to await orders, and steamed on.Turning to Rawlins, his\nchief-of-staff, Grant said:\n\n\"Rawlins, I am afraid this is a general attack.Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions are in front, and both are composed of\nraw troops; but if we can hold them until Wallace and Nelson come we are\nall right.\"\"It is a pity you did not order Wallace up when you were there,\"\nanswered Rawlins.\"Yes,\" answered Grant, \"but I couldn't make up my mind it was a general\nattack.\"It sounds very much like it,\" replied Rawlins, grimly.When Grant reached the landing the battle was raging furiously, and all\ndoubts as to its being a general attack were removed from his mind.Already the vanguard of what was afterward an army of panic-stricken men\nhad commenced gathering under the river bank.A staff officer was sent back immediately to order General Wallace to\ncome at once.Grant then set to work quickly to do what he could to stem\nthe tide, which was already turning against him.Two or three regiments\nwhich had just landed he ordered to points where they were the most\nneeded.He then rode the entire length of the line, encouraging his\ngenerals, telling them to stand firm until Wallace and Nelson came, and\nall would be well.Some of his regiments\nhad broken at the first fire, and fled panic-stricken to the Landing.Sherman was straining every nerve to hold his men firm.Oblivious of\ndanger, he rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved, encouraging,\npleading, threatening, as the case might be.Grant cautioned him to be\ncareful, and not expose himself unnecessarily, but Sherman answered: \"If\nI can stem the tide by sacrificing my life, I will willingly do it.\"Then turning to Grant, he said, with feeling: \"General, I did not\nexpect this; forgive me.\"\"You depended on me for\nreports; I quieted your fears.I reported there was no danger of an\nattack.I couldn't believe it this morning until my orderly was shot by\nmy side, and I saw the long lines of the enemy sweeping forward.\"There is nothing to forgive,\" he said, gently.If I had, I could have had Buell here.As it is, Wallace and Nelson will\nsoon be here, and we will whip them; never fear.\"By ten o'clock Prentiss had been pushed back clear through and beyond\nhis camp, and had taken position along a sunken road.General W. H. L.\nWallace's division came up and joined him on the right.This part of the\nfield was afterward known as the \"Hornet's Nest.\"Here Grant visited them, and seeing the strength of the position, told\nthem to hold it to the last man.\"We will,\" responded both Wallace and Prentiss.For hours the Confederate lines beat\nagainst them like the waves of the ocean, only to be flung back torn and\nbleeding.Both flanks of the Federal army\nwere bent back like a bow.Every moment the number of panic-stricken\nsoldiers under the bank grew larger.Noon came, but no Lew Wallace, no Nelson.Turning to an aid, Grant said:\n\"Go for Wallace; bid him hurry, hurry.\"Everywhere, except in the center, the Confederates were pressing the\nUnion lines back.But the desperate resistance offered surprised\nJohnston; he had expected an easier victory.Many of his best regiments\nhad been cut to pieces.Thousands of his men had also fled to the rear.The afternoon was passing; the fighting must be pressed.A desperate effort was made to turn the Federal left flank, and thus\ngain the Landing.Like iron Hurlbut's men stood, and time after time\nhurled back the charging columns.At last the Confederates refused to\ncharge again.Then General Johnston placed himself at their head and\nsaid: \"I will lead you, my children.\"With wild cheers his men pressed forward;\nnothing could withstand the fury of the charge.The Federal left was\ncrushed, hurled back to the Landing in a torn, disorganized mass.For a time the Confederate\narmy stood as if appalled at its great loss.The thunder of battle died\naway, only to break out here and there in fitful bursts.But the\nrespite was brief, and then came the final desperate onslaught.With features as impassive as stone, Grant saw his army crumbling to\npieces.Officer after officer had been sent to see what had become of\nGeneral Lew Wallace; he should have been on the field hours before.With\nanxious eyes Grant looked across the river to see if he could catch the\nfirst fluttering banner of Nelson's division.An officer rides up, one of the messengers he had sent for Wallace.The officer\nreports: \"Wallace took the wrong road.I found him five miles further\nfrom the Landing than when he started.Then he countermarched, instead\nof hurrying forward left in front.Then he\nis marching so slow, so slow.For an instant a spasm of pain passed over Grant's face.\"He\ncountermarched; coming slow,\" he said, as if to himself, \"Great God,\nwhat does he mean?\"Turning to Colonel Webster, he said: \"Plant the siege guns around the\nLanding.See that you have every available piece of artillery in\nposition.\"And it was only this frowning line of artillery that stood between\nGrant's army and utter rout.\"Have you any way of retreat mapped out?\"Buell had come up from Savannah on a boat, and was now on the field,\nviewing with consternation and alarm the tremendous evidences of\ndemoralization and defeat.Turning to him as quick as a flash, Grant replied: \"Retreat!I\nhave not yet despaired of victory.\"Both the right and left wings of Grant's army were now crushed back from\nthe center.Around the flanks of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss'\ndivisions the exultant Confederates poured.Well had Wallace and\nPrentiss obeyed the orders of Grant to hold their position.From ten\no'clock in the forenoon until nearly five o'clock in the afternoon their\nlines had hurled back every attack of the enemy.The Hornet's Nest stung\nevery time it was touched.But now the divisions were hemmed in on every\nside.The brave Wallace formed his men to cut their way out, and as he\nwas cheering them on he fell mortally wounded.No better soldier than\nWallace fell on that bloody field.As for the two divisions, they were\ndoomed.General Grant sits on his horse, watching the preparations for the last\nstand.An officer, despair written in every lineament of his face, rides\nup to him.\"General,\" he says, \"Sherman reports that he has taken his last\nposition.He has but the remnant of one brigade with him and what\nstragglers he has gathered.\"Go back,\" quietly said Grant, \"and tell Sherman to hold if possible;\nnight is most here.\"McClernand's division had been standing bravely all day, and had\nfurnished fewer stragglers than any other division in the army, but now\nan orderly with a pale face and his left arm resting in a bloody sling,\ncame spurring his reeking horse up to Grant, and exclaimed:\n\n\"General McClernand bade me report, that after his division had most\ngallantly repulsed the last charge of the enemy, for some unaccountable\nreason, the left regiments broke, and are fleeing panic-stricken to the\nLanding.\"\"Go tell McClernand,\" said Grant, \"that he has done well, but he must\nhold out just a little longer.General Hurlbut, his face black with the smoke of battle, rode up.\"General,\" he said, in a broken voice, \"my division is gone, the whole\nleft is gone; the way to the Landing is open to the enemy.\"\"General,\" replied Grant, without a quiver, \"rally what broken regiments\nand stragglers you can behind the guns, close up as much as possible on\nMcClernand, and hold your position to the last man.\"Now there came roaring past a confused mass of white-faced officers and\nsoldiers commingled, a human torrent stricken with deadly fear.\"Prentiss and Wallace have\nsurrendered.\"\"Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or\nfor night,\" he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's\nregiments waving.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.he cried to his aids, \"go to Sherman, to McClernand, to\nHurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard\nhad given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,\nthe capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had\ndisarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the\nmorning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when\nNelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of\ncannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,\nand Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they\nwere met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his\nsurprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his\nbrigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the\nTennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from\ncapture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into\nvictory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to\nCorinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had\nnot been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted\nto the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the\nTennessee.There was but a remnant in", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell\nfailed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered\nand was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,\nhis head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he\nhad received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance\nin the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: \"No use, General, no\nuse; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can\nassume the offensive.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the\nfield.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure.\"Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on\nthe field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had\nreceived orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg\nLanding.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for\nhis delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his\ndestination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,\nand when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all\nvestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and\nwilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though\nGrant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson\nsent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This\nofficer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay\nlistening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As\nfor Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay.\"The expected has come,\" he growled, \"and here I am doing no more good\nthan if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,\nif Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set\nof fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his\nthumbs.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division\nthrough the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen\nand infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division\nstarted at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder\nof cannon.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.\"This beats Donelson,\" remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never\nceased.\"My boy,\" replied Nelson, \"the greatest battle ever fought on this\ncontinent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping\neverything before them.\"\"Your division will surely give a good account of itself,\" said Fred,\nlooking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.\"See how eager the men\nare, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of\nthem are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they\nget there.\"\"The question is, shall we be in\ntime.\"Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the\ncombatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every\nsoldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the\nriver cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then\nwas heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly\nspent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber\non the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had\nmanaged to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came\nto ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these\nskulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river\nwere seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men\nwore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that\nthey begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering\nbeneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling\nwretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,\npraying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to\neverything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken\nthrong, they were greeted with, \"You are all going to your death!\"Don't touch my men; you\ncontaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you\nshould be swept from the face of the earth.\"And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning\ncannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed\ntheir way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked\nwith contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,\nthe next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around\nthem.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the\nsupreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank\nat Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down\ntheir lives for their country.From the Landing\ncame the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of\nthe surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been\nbright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching\nthe living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat\nagainst a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by\nchance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the\ngunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle\nbegan.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he\nrode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:\n\"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero.\"About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant\ncharge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line\nfor more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken\nmob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,\ninstead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the\nthickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of\nMabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, \"he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to\nmake her happy.\"On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of\nthe guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.Then the smoke of battle\nhid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,\nshoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying\ngrasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly\nwalk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: \"I want you to\nhunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle.\"But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying\ndown, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and\npoured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The\nbrigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of\nits number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full\nretreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed\nthe field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The\nforest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole\nthickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over\nthem.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every\nfield, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of\nall semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or\nground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men\nlay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had\nbeen blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as\nthey hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had\nnever been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the\nSouth there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would\nnot return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's\nskirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the\nHon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he\nwas.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson\naccompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he\nhad bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation\nwhen Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his\nforlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and\nhis garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the\nTennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught\nCalhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain.\"It is what is left of me,\" answered Calhoun, with a faint smile.\"You don't know,\" continued Johnson, \"how glad I am to see you.I had\ngiven you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to\ngo on your dangerous undertaking.\"First,\" answered Calhoun, \"I must speak to General Beauregard,\" and,\nsaluting, he said: \"General, I bring you heavy news.\"I feared it, I feared it, when the\nFederals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor\nas you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he\nhad not been reinforced.\"said Calhoun, \"if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you\nhad only attacked a couple of days sooner!\"\"That was the calculation,\" answered Beauregard, \"but the dreadful roads\nretarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our\nscouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of\ndays at Waynesborough.\"\"So he was,\" answered Calhoun, bitterly; \"and he would have done so if\nit had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was\nwho rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field\nto-day.\"\"Do you know how many men Buell has?\"\"Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.\"\"I thank you,\nLieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my\narmy.\"So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene\nof action.\"This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant,\" said the Governor, after\nBeauregard had gone.\"But tell me about yourself; you must have been in\ntrouble.\"At first I was very successful, and\nfound out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was\njust starting back with this important information, information which\nmeant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured\nbefore I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but\nthere was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted\nme being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me\nuntil my knowledge could do no good.\"\"It looks as though the hand of God were against us,\" solemnly responded\nJohnson.\"If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a\nday or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But\nnow----\" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then\ncontinued: \"There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and\nI must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.\"\"Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,\"\nreplied the Governor calmly.\"I shall go with you,\" replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and\ndid yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last\nfurious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,\nstaggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms\nof Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled\nforever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on\nthe field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in\nsearch of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the\nplace where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the\ncenter of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave\norders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given\nhim by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the\ncolors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise\nand delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented\nhimself.\"You are the young officer who\ngot me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never\nceased to feel grateful towards you.\"\"Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.\"\"Don't want to tie me up again, does\nhe?\"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come\nalong.\"\"General,\" said Fred, when he had found Nelson, \"here is the brave boy\nwho captured the colors.\"\"That was a gallant act, my boy,\" kindly remarked Nelson, \"and you\ndeserve the thanks of your general.\"\"It just made me mad to have\nthem shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it.\"He noticed Hugh more closely, and\nthen suddenly asked: \"Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?\"\"On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for\nstraggling.\"Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came\ninto his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: \"Liked it, didn't you?\"\"I was just\nmad enough at you to kill you.\"\"There is the boy for me,\" said Nelson, turning to his staff.\"He not\nonly captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks\nof him.\"Then addressing Hugh, he continued: \"I want a good orderly, and\nI will detail you for the position.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love\nhim as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which\nscience has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must\nride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling\nhim, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse\nand rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where\nTrabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,\nattracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his\nheart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over\nthe death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside\nit.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.He had looked into the face of his father.", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like\nform.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint\nfluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel\nShackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to\ntake a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound\nwas the work of a moment.Tenderly was\nColonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely\nsaid: \"It will have to come off.\"\"It's that, or his life,\" shortly answered the surgeon.\"Do it then,\" hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear\nthe cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room\nin a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was\nsitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been\nhovering between life and death.\"Dear father,\" whispered Fred, \"you have been very sick.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.Don't talk,\"\nand he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The\nsurgeon came in, and looking at him, said: \"It is all right, captain; he\nhas passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around.\"When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul\nin gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred\ntold him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the\nloss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life.\"And now, father,\" he said, \"I am taking you home--home where we can be\nhappy once more.\"The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his\nknees beside him.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.\"Father,\" he moaned, \"father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me\nto your heart and love me once more?\"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently\nplaced his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, \"My son!In the old Kentucky home\nFred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt\nthat he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed\nin Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and\ncrimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her\nface, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she\nrecovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: \"Now\ntell me all about it.\"Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,\namong the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he\nhad finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked\nGod that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more\nbeautiful by her sorrow, she said:\n\n\"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Hereafter I shall do\nwhat I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's\nflag.In memory of this,\" and she pressed the little blood-stained flag\nto her lips, \"I devote my life to this sacred object.\"And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered\nwords of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp\nfrom the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those\nwhose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an\nangel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward\njoined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous\nraider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of\nhis father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,\nand then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of\nGeneral George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the\nnumerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never\nperformed more valiant service than when he was known as \"General\nNelson's Scout.\"Again Rosendo, who by this time\nhad learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the\nirresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position.\"Why don't you watch where you are going?\"\"I might,\" sputtered Harris, \"if I could keep my eyes off of you.\"Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments\nfor those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling\nasleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_\nand tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning\nrepast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would\ngather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen\nto sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would\nring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either\nhand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the\njungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they\nhalf believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris\nwould draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy\nand religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he\nwas, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so\nchildishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from\nthe conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes\nmuttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his\ncollegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical\ntheories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less\nhuman belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and\nretired from the field.But his admiration for the child became\nsincere.And by the time\nthey had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he\nwas dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked\nat his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and\nfatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more\nthan mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible\nfuture in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged\ndefile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the\n_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's\nbelief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square\nmiles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the\n_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief\ndescription given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even\nmore important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense\nof conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is\nfollowing the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;\nbut he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,\nup into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the\n_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common\ndanger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered\ntraces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but\nobliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and\ndrier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed\nthe beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water\nraced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by\ncountless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered\nthem in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the\nsalt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris\nswore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful\nof food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with\nthe shrill cry, \"_Avispas_!\"Rosendo would tear recklessly through\nthe matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,\nuntil the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they\nwalked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the\ngreat _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous.\"Ah, senores,\"\ncommented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous\nroadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,\n\"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie\nthe weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and\nlet these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know\nthe terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!\"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never\nknown the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further\nrespite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;\nover monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer\nsides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_\nvines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots\nof rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,\nwhere the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams\nbecame an interminable morass, through which passage was possible\nonly by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the\ngreat trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution\nof the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous\nbellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The\nflickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men\ngrew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on\nthe slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in\nthe river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that\nblotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous\ncannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An\nunvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which\nuncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist\nearth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet\nsoil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again\nthe peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man\npatiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled\nviolently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually\ngreater.Hour after hour she toiled along,\nfloundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's\nbroad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and\npressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at\nevening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would\nbring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the\nunfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend\near to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of\nthe human mind.She\nsaw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the\nphenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment\nand cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that\nhuman endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been\nstraining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the\nsinging noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and\nplunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the\nriver Tigui.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense\ngrowth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a\nsort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east\nbank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright\nmorning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the\ngreat jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the\nground.\"La Colorado,\" he said, indicating what the Americans at length made\nout to be a frame house, looming above the high grass.\"And there,\"\npointing to the north, \"is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that\nleads to La Libertad.\"That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La\nColorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,\nyears before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz\nvein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country\nceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and\nabounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It\nseemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.Those unafflicted fled--all but one.He remained to protect the\ncompany's property.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,\nas he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining\nservant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of\nstrychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in\nthat unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in\nterror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it\nyet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the\nnight vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The\ngiant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night\ncroaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to\nthe awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless\nwrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed\nthis marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended\nlike a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting\nreligion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the\nparty and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey\nover boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo\nwould take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to\nknow the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was\nundertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region\naround the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts\nof satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,\nhunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day\nover the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don\nIgnacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who\nfind themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all\nother considerations.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,\nwith costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and\ntrail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose\nancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.", "question": "Where is John?

then the noxious\nmeasure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required\nfor this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw\nCarmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no\ntime in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,\nand securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,\nimploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then\ncame Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the\nreturned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could\ncalm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she\nhad gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti\nno more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them\nexcitedly.Then, evidently acting on\nthe advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off\nacross the lake toward the _cano_.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and\nthat the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *\n\nReed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind.\"For\nheaven's sake, Charles,\" she had cried, turning from his embrace to\nlook at the wondering girl who stood behind him, \"what have you\nhere?\"\"Oh, that,\" he laughingly replied, \"is only a little Indian I lassoed\nback in the jungle.\"And, leaving the girl to the not very tender\ngraces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and\nbegged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her\nhusband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she\npresented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been\ndelighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as\nshe had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--\"Ah, senora,\" she\npleaded, \"do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions\nand trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while\nthe girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a\nragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon\npaper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name.\"Rincon,\" the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly.\"In the Calle Lozano,\" he replied, wondering why these people seemed\ninterested in him.\"Ask him who his father\nis,\" suggested the latter.\"I do not know,\" replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says.\"Come with me to your home,\"\nshe said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little\nupper room where, years before, he had first seen the light.\"Tia Catalina,\" he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as\nthe visitors entered, \"see, some strangers!\"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question.\"The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.And--he lives up the\ngreat river?\"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying.\"Yes, senorita,\" he said eagerly, \"in\nSimiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going\nto visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?\"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed\nto the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her\nwrinkled face.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.\"_Ah, gracias, senor_,\" she murmured, bending over his hand;

and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for\nsanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic\nmessage to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,\nstopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched\nover the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night\nfell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de\nRincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow\nthe existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young\ngirl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail\nand gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw\nher heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her\nbeautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their\nhearts.CARMEN ARIZA\n\n\n\n\nBOOK 3\n\n\n           And while within myself I trace\n           The greatness of some future race,\n           Aloof with hermit-eye I scan\n           The present works of present man,--\n           A wild and dream-like trade of blood and guile,\n           Too foolish for a tear, too wicked for a smile!--_Coleridge._\n\n\n\n\nCARMEN ARIZA\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nThe blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such\nexasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,\nand revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the\nrail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with\nmyriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray\npall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of\nthe metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless\nconfusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw\nsound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their\nraucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and\nadded bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had\nnot been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The\nconvulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering\nabout little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the\nscalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness\nthat, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be\nwandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean\nvoyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of\nembarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she\ngazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before\nher: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from\nhis arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,\nwhite-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched\nLlano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding\nstream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now\nwhy she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences\nwhich had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle\nand lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which\nbeset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the\ntrackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held\nout to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,\nshe would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and\nto the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had\nsent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due", "question": "Where is Sandra?

that she was tolerated because of\nreasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took\npains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the\nperplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken\nto the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the\ntraining would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris\nalone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck\nwith her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught\nher to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He\nconducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and\nthe numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the\ndeck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in\nfrontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat\nnext to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would\nhave placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,\nthough mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a\ndrive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to\nJose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly\nrecounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving\nthese cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the\npreparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled\ncraft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the\nvessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the\n_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,\nbut had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from\nHavre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the\nsame shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,\nwhile Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a\nlittle scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with\na profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully\ninto their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs\nofficer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in\nthe shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a\nbundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,\nthe impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the\nboat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against\nthe swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,\npaper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her\nfeet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the\ndistant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to\nprevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her\nhand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for\nus up ahead.\"It was a woman, comely of feature,\nand strikingly well dressed.The\nanxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all;

and I entertained some\nalarm that a march-dike, long meditated by the two proprietors whose\nestates were divided by my favourite brook, was about to be drawn up the\nglen, in order to substitute its rectilinear deformity for the graceful\nwinding of the natural boundary.[Note: I deem it fitting that the reader\nshould be apprised that this limitary boundary between the conterminous\nheritable property of his honour the Laird of Gandercleugh, and his\nhonour the Laird of Gusedub, was to have been in fashion an agger, or\nrather murus of uncemented granite, called by the vulgar a drystane <DW18>,\nsurmounted, or coped, _cespite viridi_, i.e.Truly their\nhonours fell into discord concerning two roods of marshy ground, near the\ncove called the Bedral's Beild; and the controversy, having some years\nbygone been removed from before the judges of the land, (with whom it\nabode long,) even unto the Great City of London and the Assembly of the\nNobles therein, is, as I may say, adhuc in pendente.--J.As I\napproached, I was agreeably undeceived.An old man was seated upon the\nmonument of the slaughtered presbyterians, and busily employed in\ndeepening, with his chisel, the letters of the inscription, which,\nannouncing, in scriptural language, the promised blessings of futurity to\nbe the lot of the slain, anathematized the murderers with corresponding\nviolence.A blue bonnet of unusual dimensions covered the grey hairs of\nthe pious workman.His dress was a large old-fashioned coat of the coarse\ncloth called hoddingrey, usually worn by the elder peasants, with\nwaistcoat and breeches of the same; and the whole suit, though still in\ndecent repair, had obviously seen a train of long service.Strong clouted\nshoes, studded with hobnails, and gramoches or leggins, made of thick\nblack cloth, completed his equipment.Beside him, fed among the graves a\npony, the companion of his journey, whose extreme whiteness, as well as\nits projecting bones and hollow eyes, indicated its antiquity.It was\nharnessed in the most simple manner, with a pair of branks, a hair\ntether, or halter, and a sunk, or cushion of straw, instead of bridle and\nsaddle.A canvass pouch hung around the neck of the animal, for the\npurpose, probably, of containing the rider's tools, and any thing else he\nmight have occasion to carry with him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Although I had never seen the old\nman before, yet from the singularity of his employment, and the style of\nhis equipage, I had no difficulty in recognising a religious itinerant\nwhom I had often heard talked of, and who was known in various parts of\nScotland by the title of Old Mortality.[Illustration: The Graveyard--006]\n\n\n\"Where this man was born, or what was his real name, I have never been\nable to learn; nor are the motives which made him desert his home, and\nadopt the erratic mode of life which he pursued, known to me except very\ngenerally.According to the belief of most people, he was a native of\neither the county of Dumfries or Galloway, and lineally descended from\nsome of those champions of the Covenant, whose deeds and sufferings were\nhis favourite theme.He is said to have held, at one period of his life,\na small moorland farm; but, whether from pecuniary losses, or domestic\nmisfortune, he had long renounced that and every other gainful calling.In the language of Scripture, he left his house, his home, and his\nkindred, and wandered about until the day of his death, a period of\nnearly thirty years.\"During this long pilgrimage, the pious enthusiast regulated his circuit\nso as annually to visit the graves of the unfortunate Covenanters, who\nsuffered by the sword, or by the executioner, during the reigns of the\ntwo last monarchs of the Stewart line.These are most numerous in the\nwestern districts of Ayr, Galloway, and Dumfries; but they are also to be\nfound in other parts of Scotland, wherever the fugitives had fought, or\nfallen, or suffered by military or civil execution.Their tombs are often\napart from all human habitation, in the remote moors and wilds to which\nthe wanderers had fled for concealment.But wherever they existed, Old\nMortality was sure to visit them when his annual round brought them\nwithin his reach.In the most lonely recesses of the mountains, the\nmoor-fowl shooter has been often surprised to find him busied in cleaning\nthe moss from the grey stones, renewing with his chisel the half-defaced\ninscriptions, and repairing the emblems of death with which these simple\nmonuments are usually adorned.Motives of the most sincere, though\nfanciful devotion, induced the old man to dedicate so many years of\nexistence to perform this tribute to the memory of the deceased warriors\nof the church.He considered himself as fulfilling a sacred duty, while\nrenewing to the eyes of posterity the decaying emblems of the zeal and\nsufferings of their forefathers, and thereby trimming, as it were, the\nbeacon-light, which was to warn future generations to defend their\nreligion even unto blood.\"In all his wanderings, the old pilgrim never seemed to need, or was\nknown to accept, pecuniary assistance.It is true, his wants were very\nfew; for wherever he went, he found ready quarters in the house of some\nCameronian of his own sect, or of some other religious person.The\nhospitality which was reverentially paid to him he always acknowledged,\nby repairing the gravestones (if there existed any) belonging to the\nfamily or ancestors of his host.As the wanderer was usually to be seen\nbent on this pious task within the precincts of some country churchyard,\nor reclined on the solitary tombstone among the heath, disturbing the\nplover and the black-cock with the clink of his chisel and mallet, with\nhis old white pony grazing by his side, he acquired, from his converse\namong the dead, the popular appellation of Old Mortality.\"The character of such a man could have in it little connexion even with\ninnocent gaiety.Yet, among those of his own religious persuasion, he is\nreported to have been cheerful.The descendants of persecutors, or those\nwhom he supposed guilty of entertaining similar tenets, and the scoffers\nat religion by whom he was sometimes assailed, he usually termed the\ngeneration of vipers.Conversing with others, he was grave and\nsententious, not without a cast of severity.But he is said never to have\nbeen observed to give way to violent passion, excepting upon one\noccasion, when a mischievous truant-boy defaced with a stone the nose of\na cherub's face, which the old man was engaged in retouching.I am in\ngeneral a sparer of the rod, notwithstanding the maxim of Solomon, for\nwhich school-boys have little reason to thank his memory; but on this\noccasion I deemed it proper to show that I did not hate the child.--But I\nmust return to the circumstances attending my first interview with this\ninteresting enthusiast.\"In accosting Old Mortality, I did not fail to pay respect to his years\nand his principles, beginning my address by a respectful apology for\ninterrupting his labours.The old man intermitted the operation of the\nchisel, took off his spectacles and wiped them, then, replacing them on\nhis nose, acknowledged my courtesy by a suitable return.Encouraged by\nhis affability, I intruded upon him some questions concerning the\nsufferers on whose monument he was now employed.To talk of the exploits\nof the Covenanters was the delight, as to repair their monuments was the", "question": "Where is Sandra?

and yet you\nmay be gathered into the garner of mortality before me, for the sickle of\ndeath cuts down the green as oft as the ripe, and there is a colour in\nyour cheek, that, like the bud of the rose, serveth oft to hide the worm\nof corruption.Wherefore labour as one who knoweth not when his master\ncalleth.And if it be my lot to return to this village after ye are gane\nhame to your ain place, these auld withered hands will frame a stane of\nmemorial, that your name may not perish from among the people.'\"I thanked Old Mortality for his kind intentions in my behalf, and heaved\na sigh, not, I think, of regret so much as of resignation, to think of\nthe chance that I might soon require his good offices.But though, in all\nhuman probability, he did not err in supposing that my span of life may\nbe abridged in youth, he had over-estimated the period of his own\npilgrimage on earth.It is now some years since he has been missed in all\nhis usual haunts, while moss, lichen, and deer-hair, are fast covering\nthose stones, to cleanse which had been the business of his life.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.About\nthe beginning of this century he closed his mortal toils, being found on\nthe highway near Lockerby, in Dumfries-shire, exhausted and just\nexpiring.The old white pony, the companion of all his wanderings, was\nstanding by the side of his dying master.There was found about his\nperson a sum of money sufficient for his decent interment, which serves\nto show that his death was in no ways hastened by violence or by want.The common people still regard his memory with great respect; and many\nare of opinion, that the stones which he repaired will not again require\nthe assistance of the chisel.They even assert, that on the tombs where\nthe manner of the martyrs' murder is recorded, their names have remained\nindelibly legible since the death of Old Mortality, while those of the\npersecutors, sculptured on the same monuments, have been entirely\ndefaced.It is hardly necessary to say that this is a fond imagination,\nand that, since the time of the pious pilgrim, the monuments which were\nthe objects of his care are hastening, like all earthly memorials, into\nruin or decay.\"My readers will of course understand, that in embodying into one\ncompressed narrative many of the anecdotes which I had the advantage of\nderiving from Old Mortality, I have been far from adopting either his\nstyle, his opinions, or even his facts, so far as they appear to have\nbeen distorted by party prejudice.I have endeavoured to correct or\nverify them from the most authentic sources of tradition, afforded by the\nrepresentatives of either party.\"On the part of the Presbyterians, I have consulted such moorland farmers\nfrom the western districts, as, by the kindness of their landlords, or\notherwise, have been able, during the late general change of property, to\nretain possession of the grazings on which their grandsires fed their\nflocks and herds.I must own, that of late days, I have found this a\nlimited source of information.I have, therefore, called in the\nsupplementary aid of those modest itinerants, whom the scrupulous\ncivility of our ancestors denominated travelling merchants, but whom, of\nlate, accommodating ourselves in this as in more material particulars, to\nthe feelings and sentiments of our more wealthy neighbours, we have\nlearned to call packmen or pedlars.To country weavers travelling in\nhopes to get rid of their winter web, but more especially to tailors,\nwho, from their sedentary profession, and the necessity, in our country,\nof exercising it by temporary residence in the families by whom they are\nemployed, may be considered as possessing a complete register of rural\ntraditions, I have been indebted for many illustrations of the narratives\nof Old Mortality, much in the taste and spirit of the original.\"I had more difficulty in finding materials for correcting the tone of\npartiality which evidently pervaded those stores of traditional learning,\nin order that I might be enabled to present an unbiassed picture of the\nmanners of that unhappy period, and, at the same time, to do justice to\nthe merits of both parties.But I have been enabled to qualify the\nnarratives of Old Mortality and his Cameronian friends, by the reports of\nmore than one descendant of ancient and honourable families, who,\nthemselves decayed into the humble vale of life, yet look proudly back on\nthe period when their ancestors fought and fell in behalf of the exiled\nhouse of Stewart.I may even boast right reverend authority on the same\nscore; for more than one nonjuring bishop, whose authority and income\nwere upon as apostolical a scale as the greatest abominator of Episcopacy\ncould well desire, have deigned, while partaking of the humble cheer of\nthe Wallace Inn, to furnish me with information corrective of the facts\nwhich I learned from others.There are also here and there a laird or\ntwo, who, though they shrug their shoulders, profess no great shame in\ntheir fathers having served in the persecuting squadrons of Earlshall and\nClaverhouse.From the gamekeepers of these gentlemen, an office the most\napt of any other to become hereditary in such families, I have also\ncontrived to collect much valuable information.\"Upon the whole, I can hardly fear, that, at this time, in describing the\noperation which their opposite principles produced upon the good and bad\nmen of both parties, I can be suspected of meaning insult or injustice to\neither.If recollection of former injuries, extra-loyalty, and contempt\nand hatred of their adversaries, produced rigour and tyranny in the one\nparty, it will hardly be denied, on the other hand, that, if the zeal for\nGod's house did not eat up the conventiclers, it devoured at least, to\nimitate the phrase of Dryden, no small portion of their loyalty, sober\nsense, and good breeding.We may safely hope, that the souls of the brave\nand sincere on either side have long looked down with surprise and pity\nupon the ill-appreciated motives which caused their mutual hatred and\nhostility, while in this valley of darkness, blood, and tears.Let us think of them as the heroine of our only Scottish\ntragedy entreats her lord to think of her departed sire:--\n\n               'O rake not up the ashes of our fathers!Implacable resentment was their crime,\n               And grievous has the expiation been.'\"Summon an hundred horse, by break of day,\n               To wait our pleasure at the castle gates.Under the reign of the last Stewarts, there was an anxious wish on the\npart of government to counteract, by every means in their power, the\nstrict or puritanical spirit which had been the chief characteristic of\nthe republican government, and to revive those feudal institutions which\nunited the vassal to the liege lord, and both to the crown.Frequent\nmusters and assemblies of the people, both for military exercise and for\nsports and pastimes, were appointed by authority.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.The interference, in\nthe latter case, was impolitic, to say the least; for, as usual on such\noccasions, the consciences which were at first only scrupulous, became\nconfirmed in their opinions, instead of giving way to the terrors of\nauthority; and the youth of both sexes, to whom the pipe and tabor in\nEngland, or the bagpipe in Scotland, would have been in themselves an\nirresistible temptation, were enabled to set them at defiance, from the\nproud consciousness that they were, at the same time, resisting an act of\ncouncil.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.To compel men to dance and be merry by authority, has rarely\nsucceeded even on board of slave-ships, where it was formerly sometimes\nattempted by way of inducing the wretched captives to agitate their limbs\nand restore the circulation, during the few minutes they were permitted\nto enjoy the fresh air upon deck.The rigour of the strict Calvinists\nincreased, in proportion to the wishes of the government that it should\nbe relaxed.A judaical observance of the Sabbath--a supercilious\ncondemnation of all manly pastimes and harmless recreations, as well as\nof the profane custom of promiscuous dancing, that is, of men and women\ndancing together in the same party (for I believe they admitted that\nthe exercise might be inoffensive if practised by the parties\nseparately)--distinguishing those who professed a more than ordinary\nshare of sanctity, they discouraged, as far as lay in their power, even\nthe ancient wappen-schaws, as they were termed, when the feudal array of\nthe county was called out, and each crown-vassal was required to appear\nwith such muster of men and armour as he was bound to make by his fief,\nand that under high statutory penalties.The Covenanters were the more\njealous of those assemblies, as the lord lieutenants and sheriffs under\nwhom they were held had instructions from the government to spare no\npains which might render them agreeable to the young men who were thus\nsummoned together, upon whom the military exercise of the morning, and\nthe sports which usually closed the evening, might naturally be supposed\nto have a seductive effect.The preachers and proselytes of the more rigid presbyterians laboured,\ntherefore, by caution, remonstrance, and authority, to diminish the\nattendance upon these summonses, conscious that in doing so, they\nlessened not only the apparent, but the actual strength of the\ngovernment, by impeding the extension of that esprit de corps which soon\nunites young men who are in the habit of meeting together for manly\nsport, or military exercise.They, therefore, exerted themselves\nearnestly to prevent attendance on these occasions by those who could\nfind any possible excuse for absence, and were especially severe upon\nsuch of their hearers as mere curiosity led to be spectators, or love of\nexercise to be partakers, of the array and the sports which took place.Such of the gentry as acceded to these doctrines were not always,\nhowever, in a situation to be ruled by them.The commands of the law were\nimperative; and the privy council, who administered the executive power\nin Scotland, were severe in enforcing the statutory penalties against the\ncrown-vassals who did not appear at the periodical wappen-schaw.The\nlandholders were compelled, therefore, to send their sons, tenants, and\nvassals to the rendezvous, to the number of horses, men, and spears, at\nwhich they were rated; and it frequently happened, that notwithstanding\nthe strict charge of their elders, to return as soon as the formal\ninspection was over, the young men-at-arms were unable to resist the\ntemptation of sharing in the sports which succeeded the muster, or to\navoid listening to the prayers read in the churches on these occasions,\nand thus, in the opinion of their repining parents, meddling with the\naccursed thing which is an abomination in the sight of the Lord.The sheriff of the county of Lanark was holding the wappen-schaw of a\nwild district, called the Upper Ward of Clydesdale, on a haugh or level\nplain, near to a royal borough, the name of which is no way essential to\nmy story, on the morning of the 5th of May, 1679, when our narrative\ncommences.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.When the musters had been made, and duly reported, the young\nmen, as was usual, were to mix in various sports, of which the chief was\nto shoot at the popinjay, an ancient game formerly practised with\narchery, but at this period with fire-arms.[Note: Festival of the Popinjay.The Festival of the Popinjay is\n     still, I believe, practised at Maybole, in Ayrshire.The following\n     passage in the history of the Somerville family, suggested the\n     scenes in the text.The author of that curious manuscript thus\n     celebrates his father's demeanour at such an assembly.\"Having now passed his infancie, in the tenth year of his age, he\n     was by his grandfather putt to the grammar school, ther being then\n     att the toune of Delserf a very able master that taught the grammar,\n     and fitted boyes for the colledge.Dureing", "question": "Where is Sandra?

but\nthe company, for the reasons already assigned, was rather select than\nnumerous.Near to the enormous leathern vehicle which we have attempted to\ndescribe, vindicating her title to precedence over the untitled gentry of\nthe country, might be seen the sober palfrey of Lady Margaret Bellenden,\nbearing the erect and primitive form of Lady Margaret herself, decked in\nthose widow's weeds which the good lady had never laid aside, since the\nexecution of her husband for his adherence to Montrose.Her grand-daughter, and only earthly care, the fair-haired Edith, who was\ngenerally allowed to be the prettiest lass in the Upper Ward, appeared\nbeside her aged relative like Spring placed close to Winter.Her black\nSpanish jennet, which she managed with much grace, her gay riding-dress,\nand laced side-saddle, had been anxiously prepared to set her forth to\nthe best advantage.But the clustering profusion of ringlets, which,\nescaping from under her cap, were only confined by a green ribbon from\nwantoning over her shoulders; her cast of features, soft and feminine,\nyet not without a certain expression of playful archness, which redeemed\ntheir sweetness from the charge of insipidity, sometimes brought against\nblondes and blue-eyed beauties,--these attracted more admiration from the\nwestern youth than either the splendour of her equipments or the figure\nof her palfrey.The attendance of these distinguished ladies was rather inferior to their\nbirth and fashion in those times, as it consisted only of two servants on\nhorseback.The truth was, that the good old lady had been obliged to make\nall her domestic servants turn out to complete the quota which her barony\nought to furnish for the muster, and in which she would not for the\nuniverse have been found deficient.The old steward, who, in steel cap\nand jack-boots, led forth her array, had, as he said, sweated blood and\nwater in his efforts to overcome the scruples and evasions of the\nmoorland farmers, who ought to have furnished men, horse, and harness, on\nthese occasions.At last, their dispute came near to an open declaration\nof hostilities, the incensed episcopalian bestowing on the recusants the\nwhole thunders of the commination, and receiving from them, in return,\nthe denunciations of a Calvinistic excommunication.To punish the refractory tenants would have been easy enough.The privy\ncouncil would readily have imposed fines, and sent a troop of horse to\ncollect them.But this would have been calling the huntsman and hounds\ninto the garden to kill the hare.\"For,\" said Harrison to himself, \"the carles have little eneugh gear at\nony rate, and if I call in the red-coats and take away what little they\nhave, how is my worshipful lady to get her rents paid at Candlemas, which\nis but a difficult matter to bring round even in the best of times?\"So he armed the fowler, and falconer, the footman, and the ploughman, at\nthe home farm, with an old drunken cavaliering butler, who had served\nwith the late Sir Richard under Montrose, and stunned the family nightly\nwith his exploits at Kilsythe and Tippermoor, and who was the only man in\nthe party that had the smallest zeal for the work in hand.In this\nmanner, and by recruiting one or two latitudinarian poachers and\nblack-fishers, Mr Harrison completed the quota of men which fell to the\nshare of Lady Margaret Bellenden, as life-rentrix of the barony of\nTillietudlem and others.But when the steward, on the morning of the\neventful day, had mustered his _troupe dore_ before the iron gate of the\ntower, the mother of Cuddie Headrigg the ploughman appeared, loaded with\nthe jackboots, buff coat, and other accoutrements which had been issued\nforth for the service of the day, and laid them before the steward;\ndemurely assuring him, that \"whether it were the colic, or a qualm of\nconscience, she couldna tak upon her to decide, but sure it was, Cuddie\nhad been in sair straits a' night, and she couldna say he was muckle\nbetter this morning.The finger of Heaven,\" she said, \"was in it, and her\nbairn should gang on nae sic errands.\"Pains, penalties, and threats of\ndismission, were denounced in vain; the mother was obstinate, and Cuddie,\nwho underwent a domiciliary visitation for the purpose of verifying his\nstate of body, could, or would, answer only by deep groans.Mause, who\nhad been an ancient domestic in the family, was a sort of favourite with\nLady Margaret, and presumed accordingly.Lady Margaret had herself set\nforth, and her authority could not be appealed to.In this dilemma, the\ngood genius of the old butler suggested an expedient.\"He had seen mony a braw callant, far less than Guse Gibbie, fight brawly\nunder Montrose.This was a half-witted lad, of very small stature, who had a kind of\ncharge of the poultry under the old henwife; for in a Scottish family of\nthat day there was a wonderful substitution of labour.This urchin being\nsent for from the stubble-field, was hastily muffled in the buff coat,\nand girded rather to than with the sword of a full-grown man, his little\nlegs plunged into jack-boots, and a steel cap put upon his head, which\nseemed, from its size, as if it had been intended to extinguish him.Thus\naccoutred, he was hoisted, at his own earnest request, upon the quietest\nhorse of the party; and, prompted and supported by old Gudyill the\nbutler, as his front file, he passed muster tolerably enough; the sheriff\nnot caring to examine too closely the recruits of so well-affected a\nperson as Lady Margaret Bellenden.To the above cause it was owing that the personal retinue of Lady\nMargaret, on this eventful day, amounted only to two lacqueys, with which\ndiminished train she would, on any other occasion, have been much ashamed\nto appear in public.But, for the cause of royalty, she was ready at any\ntime to have made the most unreserved personal sacrifices.She had lost\nher husband and two promising sons in the civil wars of that unhappy\nperiod; but she had received her reward, for, on his route through the\nwest of Scotland to meet Cromwell in the unfortunate field of Worcester,\nCharles the Second had actually breakfasted at the Tower of Tillietudlem;\nan incident which formed, from that moment, an important era in the life\nof Lady Margaret, who seldom afterwards partook of that meal, either at\nhome or abroad, without detailing the whole circumstances of the royal\nvisit, not forgetting the salutation which his majesty conferred on each\nside of her face, though she sometimes omitted to notice that he bestowed\nthe same favour on two buxom serving-wenches who appeared at her back,\nelevated for the day into the capacity of waiting gentlewomen.[Illustration: Tillietudlem Castle--128]\n\n\nThese instances of royal favour were decisive; and if Lady Margaret had\nnot been a confirmed royalist already, from sense of high birth,\ninfluence of education, and hatred to the opposite party, through whom\nshe had suffered such domestic calamity, the having given a breakfast to\nmajesty, and received the royal salute in return, were honours enough of\nthemselves to unite her exclusively to the fortunes of the Stewarts.These were now, in all appearance, triumphant; but Lady Margaret's zeal\nhad adhered to them through the worst of times, and was ready to sustain\nthe same severities of fortune should their scale once more kick the\nbeam.At present she enjoyed, in full extent, the military display of the\nforce which stood ready to support the crown, and stifled, as well as she\ncould, the mortification she felt at the unworthy desertion of her own\nretainers.At last I found a\n\"comfortable\" stone, sheltered from the wind, which blew tolerably\nfresh, and utterly solitary (as I thought), the intense silence\nbeing such that one could almost hear the cropping of three placid\nsheep--evidently well accustomed to sunsets, and thinking them of\nlittle consequence.There I sat until the last red spark had gone out, quenched in the\nAtlantic waters, and from behind the vanished sun sprung a gleam of\nabsolutely green light, \"like a firework out of a rocket,\" the young\npeople said; such as I had never seen before, though we saw it once\nafterwards.Nature's fireworks they were; and I could see even the two\nlittle black figures moving along the rocks below stand still to watch\nthem.I watched too, with that sort of lonely delight--the one shadow\nupon it being that it is so lonely--with which all one's life one is\naccustomed to watch beautiful and vanishing things.Then seeing how\nfast the colours were fading and the sky darkening, I rose; but just\ntook a step or two farther to look over the edge of my stone into the\nnext dip of the cliff, and there I saw--\n\n[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS--EVENING.]Nothing else would have\nsat so long and so silently, for I had been within three yards of them\nall the time, and had never discovered them, nor they me.They sat, quite absorbed in\none another, hand in hand, looking quietly seaward, their faces bathed\nin the rosy sunset--which to them was a sunrise, the sort of sun which\nnever rises twice in a life-time.Evidently they did not see me, in fact I just\npeered over the rock's edge and drew back again; any slight sound they\nprobably attributed to the harmless sheep.Well, it was but an equally\nharmless old woman, who did not laugh at them, as some might have done,\nbut smiled and wished them well, as she left them to their sunset, and\nturned to face the darkening east, where the sun would rise to-morrow.The moon was rising there now, and it was a picture to behold.Indeed,\nall these Cornish days seemed so full of moonrises and sunsets--and\nsunrises too--that it was really inconvenient.Going to bed seemed\nalmost a sin--as on this night, when, opening our parlour door, which\nlooked right on to the garden, we saw the whole world lying in a flood\nof moonlight peace, the marigolds and carnations leaning cheek to\ncheek, as motionless as the two young lovers on the cliff.must long ago have had their dream broken, for five minutes afterwards\nI had met a most respectable fat couple from Lizard Town taking their\nSunday evening stroll, in all their Sunday best, along those very\ncliffs.But perhaps, the good folks had once\nbeen lovers too.How the stars\nshone, without a mist or a cloud; how the Lizard Lights gleamed, even\nin spite of the moonlight, and how clear showed the black outline of\nKynance Cove, from which came through the silence a dull murmur of\nwaves!It was, as we declared, a sin and a shame to go to bed at all\nthough we had been out the whole day, and hoped to be out the whole of\nto-morrow.Still, human nature could not keep awake for ever.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.We passed\nfrom the poetical to the practical, and decided to lay us down and\nsleep.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.But, in the middle of the night I woke, rose, and looked out of the\nwindow.Sea and sky were one blackness, literally as \"black as\nink,\" and melting into one another so that both were undistinguishable.As for the moon and stars--heaven knows where they had gone to, for\nthey", "question": "Where is Sandra?

also some anxious looks from our handmaiden.Apparently no\nfire, had been lit in this rather despised room for many months--years\nperhaps--and the chimney rather resented being used.A few agonised\ndown-puffs greatly interfered with the comfort of the breakfast table,\nand an insane attempt to open the windows made matters worse.Which was most preferable--to be stifled or deluged?We were just\nconsidering the question, when the chimney took a new and kinder\nthought, or the wind took a turn--it seemed to blow alternately from\nevery quarter, and then from all quarters at once--the smoke went up\nstraight, the room grew warm and bright, with the cosy peace of the\nfirst fire of the season.Existence became once more endurable, nay,\npleasant.And we began to laugh over our\nlost day which we had meant to begin by bathing in Housel Cove; truly,\njust to stand outside the door would give an admirable douche bath in\nthree minutes.\"But how nice it is to be inside, with a roof over our\nheads, and no necessity for travelling.Fancy the unfortunate tourists\nwho have fixed on to-day for visiting the Lizard!\"(Charles had told us\nthat Monday was a favourite day for excursions.)\"Fancy anybody being\nobliged to go out such weather as this!\"And in our deep pity for our fellow-creatures we forgot to pity\nourselves.Nor was there much pity needed; we had provided against emergencies,\nwith a good store of needlework and knitting, anything that would\npack in small compass, also a stock of unquestionably \"light\"\nliterature--paper-covered, double-columned, sixpenny volumes, inclosing\nan amount of enjoyment which those only can understand who are true\nlovers of Walter Scott.We had enough of him to last for a week of wet\ndays.And we had a one-volume Tennyson, all complete, and a \"Morte\nd'Arthur\"--Sir Thomas Malory's.On this literary provender we felt that\nas yet we should not starve.Also, some little fingers having a trifling turn for art, brought out\ntriumphantly a colour-box, pencils, and pictures.And the wall-paper\nbeing one of the very ugliest that ever eye beheld, we sought and\nobtained permission to adorn it with these, our _chefs-d'[oe]uvre_,\npasted at regular intervals.Where we hope they still remain, for the\nedification of succeeding lodgers.We read the \"Idylls of the King\" all through, finishing with \"The\nPassing of Arthur,\" where the \"bold Sir Bedivere\" threw Excalibur into\nthe mere--which is supposed to be Dozmare Pool.Here King Arthur's\nfaithful lover was so melted--for the hundredth time--by the pathos\nof the story, and by many old associations, that the younger and\nmore practical minds grew scornful, and declared that probably King\nArthur had never existed at all--or if he had, was nothing but a rough\nbarbarian, unlike even the hero of Sir Thomas Malory, and far more\nunlike the noble modern gentleman of Tennyson's verse.Maybe: and yet,\nseeing that\n\n  \"'Tis better to have loved and lost\n  Than never to have loved at all,\"\n\nmay it not be better to have believed in an impossible ideal man, than\nto accept contentedly a low ideal, and worship blindly the worldly, the\nmean, or the base?This topic furnished matter for so much hot argument, that, besides\ndoing a quantity of needlework, we succeeded in making our one wet day\nby no means the least amusing of our seventeen days in Cornwall.[Illustration: HAULING IN THE LINES.]Hour after hour we watched the rain--an even down-pour.In the midst\nof it we heard a rumour that Charles had been seen about the town, and\nsoon after he appeared at the door, hat in hand, soaked but smiling,\nto inquire for and sympathise with his ladies.Yes, he _had_ brought a\nparty to the Lizard that day!--unfortunate souls (or bodies), for there\ncould not have been a dry thread left on them!We gathered closer round\nour cosy fire; ate our simple dinner with keen enjoyment, and agreed\nthat after all we had much to be thankful for.In the afternoon the storm abated a little, and we thought we would\nseize the chance of doing some shopping, if there was a shop in Lizard\nTown.So we walked--I ought rather to say waded, for the road was\nliterally swimming--meeting not one living creature, except a family of\nyoung ducks, who, I need scarcely say, were enjoying supreme felicity.\"Yes, ladies, this is the sort of weather we have pretty well all\nwinter.Very little frost or snow, but rain and storm, and plenty of\nit.Also fogs; I've heard there's nothing anywhere like the fogs at the\nLizard.\"So said the woman at the post-office, which, except the serpentine\nshops, seemed to be the one emporium of commerce in the place.There we\ncould get all we wanted, and a good deal that we were very thankful we\ndid not want, of eatables, drinkables, and wearables.Also ornaments,\nchina vases, &c., of a kind that would have driven frantic any person\nof aesthetic tastes.Among them an active young Cornishman of about a\nyear old was meandering aimlessly, or with aims equally destructive\nto himself and the community.He all but succeeded in bringing down a\nrow of plates upon his devoted head, and then tied himself up, one fat\nfinger after another, in a ball of twine, upon which he began to howl\nviolently.\"He's a regular little trial,\" said the young mother proudly.\"He's\nonly sixteen months old, and yet he's up to all sorts of mischief.I\ndon't know what in the world I shall do with he, presently.\"Not naughty, only active,\" suggested another maternal spirit, and\npleaded that the young jackanapes should be found something to do that\nwas not mischief, but yet would occupy his energies, and fill his mind.At which, the bright bold face looked up as if he had understood it\nall--an absolutely fearless face, brimming with fun, and shrewdness\ntoo.The \"regular little trial\" may grow into a valuable\nmember of society--fisherman, sailor, coastguardman--daring and doing\nheroic deeds; perhaps saving many a life on nights such as last night,\nwhich had taught us what Cornish coast-life was all winter through.The storm was now gradually abating; the wind had lulled entirely, the\nrain had ceased, and by sunset a broad yellow streak all along the west\nimplied that it might possibly be a fine day to-morrow.But the lane was almost a river still, and the slippery altitudes of\nthe \"hedges\" were anything but desirable.As the only possible place\nfor a walk I ventured into a field where two or three cows cropped\ntheir supper of damp grass round one of those green hillocks seen in\nevery Cornish pasture field--a manure heap planted with cabbages, which\ngrow there with a luxuriance that turns ugliness into positive beauty.Very dreary everything was--the soaking grass, the leaden sky, the\nangry-looking sea, over which a rainy moon was just beginning to throw\na faint glimmer; while shorewards one could just trace the outline of\nLizard Point and the wheat-field behind it.Yesterday those fields had\nlooked so sunshiny and fair, but to-night they were all dull and grey,\nwith rows of black dots indicating the soppy, sodden harvest sheaves.Which reminded me that to-morrow was the harvest festival at\nLandewednack, when all the world and his wife was invited by shilling\ntickets to have tea in the rectory garden, and afterwards to assist at\nthe evening thanksgiving service in the church.some poor farmer might well exclaim,\nespecially on such a day as this.Some harvest festivals must\noccasionally seem a bitter mockery.Indeed, I doubt if the next\ngeneration will not be wise in taking our \"Prayers for Rain,\"\n\"Prayers for Fair Weather,\" clean out of the liturgy.Such conceited\nintermeddling with the government of the world sounds to some\nridiculous, to others actually profane.\"Snow and hail, mists and\nvapours, wind and storm, fulfilling His Word.\"And it must be\nfulfilled, no matter at what cost to individuals or to nations.The\nlaws of the universe must be carried out, even though the mystery\nof sorrow, like the still greater mystery of evil, remains for ever\nunexplained.\"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\"How marvellously beautiful He can make this\nworld!until we can hardly imagine anything more beautiful in the world\neverlasting.Ay, even after such a day as to-day, when the world seems\nhardly worth living in, yet we live on, live to wake up unto such a\nto-morrow--\n\nBut I must wait to speak of it in another page.DAY THE SIXTH\n\n\nAnd a day absolutely divine!Not a cloud upon the sky, not a ripple\nupon the water, or it appeared so in the distance.Nearer, no doubt,\nthere would have been that heavy ground-swell which is so long in\nsubsiding, in fact is scarcely ever absent on this coast.The land,\nlike the sea, was all one smile; the pasture fields shone in brilliant\ngreen, the cornfields gleaming yellow--at once a beauty and a\nthanksgiving.It was the very perfection of an autumn morning.We would not lose\nan hour of it, but directly after breakfast started leisurely to\nfind Housel Cove and try our first experiment of bathing in the wide\nAtlantic.Not a rood of land lay between us and\nAmerica.Yet the illimitable ocean \"where the great ships go down,\"\nrolled in to our feet in baby ripples, disporting itself harmlessly,\nand tempting my two little mermaids to swim out to the utmost limit\nthat prudence allowed.And how delightful it was to run back barefoot\nacross the soft sand to the beautiful dressing-room of serpentine\nrock, where one could sit and watch the glittering sea, untroubled by\nany company save the gulls and cormorants.What a contrast to other\nbathing places--genteel Eastbourne and Brighton, or vulgar Margate and\nRamsgate, where, nevertheless, the good folks look equally happy.Shall we stamp ourselves\nas persons of little mind, easily satisfied, if I confess that we\nspent the whole morning in Housel Cove without band or promenade,\nwithout even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement\nbeing the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of\na small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill\nchance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his\nsea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of\nhim, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he\nresides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely\nnothing!<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for\nthose few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares\nalike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one's hands and look\nat the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps\nto count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest\nalways--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that\nstone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside\nthem, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our\nfeet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of\nhumanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,\ngreatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and\nmoat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,\nhave we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy\nif by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will\nsoon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse\nwhom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the\nleg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be\nthe ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the\n\"hedges\" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the\ncreatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,\nas it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one\nanother, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at\nthe sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of\nquadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We\nsat in a row on the top of the \"hedge,\" enjoying the golden afternoon,\nand scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;\neverything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,\nsummer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and\ndistant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we\nhad nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought\nthe news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its\nvery best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,\nthough small were our possibilities of toilette.\"Nobody knows us, and we know\nnobody.\"A position rather rare to those who \"dwell among their own people,\"\nwho take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable\ncredulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in\nits pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,\nbut courtesy--a courtesy that was given", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know\na single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener\nat the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty\ngarden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of\nrich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas\ngrew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid\nas trees.In front of the open hall door was a gravel sweep where were ranged\ntwo long tea-tables filled with the humbler but respectable class of\nparishioners, chiefly elderly people, and some very old.The Lizard is\na place noted for longevity, as is proved by the register books, where\nseveral deaths at over a hundred may be found recorded, and one--he was\nthe rector of Landewednack in 1683--is said to have died at the age of\n120 years.The present rector is no such Methuselah.He moved actively to and fro\namong his people, and so did his wife, whom we should have recognised\nby her omnipresent kindliness, even if she had not come and welcomed\nus strangers--easily singled out as strangers, where all the rest were\nfriends.Besides the poor and the aged, there was a goodly number of guests\nwho were neither the one nor the other, playing energetically at\nlawn-tennis behind the house, on a \"lawn\" composed of sea-sand.All\nseemed determined to amuse themselves and everybody else, and all did\ntheir very best--including the band.I would fain pass it over in silence (would it\nhad returned the compliment!); but truth is truth, and may benefit\nrather than harm.The calm composure with which those half-dozen\nwind-instruments sat in a row, playing determinedly flat, bass coming\nin with a tremendous boom here and there, entirely at his own volition,\nwithout regard to time or tune, was the most awful thing I ever heard\nin music!Agony, pure and simple, was the only sensation it produced.When they struck up, we just ran away till the tune was ended--what\ntune, familiar or unfamiliar, it was impossible to say.Between us\nthree, all blessed, or cursed, with musical ears, there existed such\ndifference of opinion on this head, that decision became vain.And\nwhen at last, as the hour of service approached, little groups began\nstrolling towards the church, the musicians began a final \"God save the\nQueen,\" barely recognisable, a feeling of thankfulness was the only\nsensation left.[Illustration: THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER--A CORNISH STUDY.]<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Now, let me not be hard upon these village Orpheuses.They did their\nbest, and for a working man to study music in any form is a good and\ndesirable thing.But whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing\nwell.The great bane of provincial life is that people have so few\nopportunities of finding out when they do _not_ do things well, and so\nlittle ambition to learn to do them better.If these few severe remarks\nshould spur on that anonymous band to try and emulate the Philharmonic\nor the Crystal Palace orchestra, it will be all the better for the\nlittle community at the Lizard.A crowded congregation--not a\nseat vacant--listened to the excellent chanting, hymns, and a harvest\nanthem, most accurately and correctly sung.The organist too--it was\na pleasure to watch that young man's face and see with what interest\nand enthusiasm he entered into it all.Besides the rector, there were\nseveral other clergymen, one of whom, an old man, read the prayers\nwith an intonation and expression which I have rarely heard equalled,\nand another preached what would have been called anywhere a thoroughly\ngood sermon.All the statelier guests at the Rectory tea--probably\ncounty families (one stout lady had the dignity of a duchess at\nleast)--\"assisted\" at this evening service, and behind them was a\nthrong of humbler folk, among whom we recognised our sole friend here,\nJohn Curgenven.We had passed him at the church door, and he had lifted\nhis hat with the air of a _preux chevalier_ of the olden time; \"more\nlike King Arthur than ever\"--we observed to one another.He, and we, and the aristocratic groups, with a few more of the\ncongregation, lingered for several minutes after service was over,\nadmiring the beautiful flowers and fruit.I think I never saw any\ndecorations so rich or so tasteful.And then, as the organ played us\nout with an exceedingly brilliant voluntary, the vision of light and\ncolour melted away, and we came out upon the quiet churchyard, lying in\nthe cold, still moonlight.Clear as day, the round silver orb sailing\nthrough a cloudless sky of that deep dark which we know is blue, only\nmoonlight shows no colours.Oh, Lady Moon, Lady Moon, what a dangerous\nnight for some of those groups to go walking home in!We saw them in\ntwos and threes, various young people whom we had got to know by sight,\nand criticise, and take an interest in, wandering slowly on through\nLizard Town, and then diverging into quieter paths.For there, in an open space near the two hotels\nwhich co-exist close together--I hope amicably, and divide the tourist\ncustom of the place--in front of a row of open windows which showed the\nremains of a _table d'hote_, and playing lively tunes to a group of\ndelighted listeners, including some children, who had struck up a merry\ndance--stood that terrible wind band!All our sympathy with our fellow-creatures, our\npleasure in watching them enjoy themselves, our interest in studying\nhuman nature in the abstract, nay, even the picturesqueness of the\ncharming moonlight scene, could not tempt us to stay.We paused a\nminute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled.Gradually those\nfearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of\nmoonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful,\nof the far-gleaming Lizard Lights.DAY THE SEVENTH\n\n\nJohn Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising,\nhalf regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King\nArthur--\"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you.\"And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a\npicture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the\nother--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be\npaid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun.He\ncame to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.We did not like venturing in strange and\ndangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector.But this was\nour last chance, and such a lovely day.\"You won't come to any harm, ladies,\" said the consoling John.\"I'll\ntake you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff.You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance,\nand then you go down a steep path to the Cove.You'll have plenty of\ntime before the tide comes in to see everything.\"\"Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the\nKitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to\nswim out far, though.And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs\nin pretty fast.\"\"Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe.Only\ndon't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it.\"Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we\ncould manage even without our friend.So, long ere the dew was dried on\nthe sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening\nhis quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man\nof his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all\nthe way.[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.]\"Ower the muir amang the heather\" have I tramped many a mile in\nbonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite\ndifferent.As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face,\nand his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch\npeasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle \"dour.\"John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet\nindependence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to\nstop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or\nbog.He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the\nlittle community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice,\nupon its summer savings.\"Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if\nwe've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am.\"I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a\nremarkably sober set at the Lizard.\"Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the\npublic-house, for we've got none to spend.I'm no teetotaller myself,\"\nadded John boldly.\"I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I\ncan afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I\ndo take it I always know when to stop.\"Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop.It is this\nwhich makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise\nman and a fool.Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and\ncommon sense, is the best possession of any human being.And looking at\nthe honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it.\"Now I must leave you, ladies,\" said he, a great deal sooner than we\nwished, for we much liked talking to him.\"My time's nearly up, and I\nmustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day,\nand has been a good friend to me.The road's straight before you,\nladies; and there's another party just ahead of you.Follow the track,\nand you'll soon be at Kynance.It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I\nhope you'll enjoy yourselves.\"John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight\nof the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as\nactive and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level\ndown.When, afterwards, I stood one dull winter day\nin a London Art Gallery, opposite the _Cornish Lions_, how well I\nrecalled this day!How truly Brett's picture gives the long roll of\nthe wave upon the silver sands, the richly-tinted rocks and caves, the\nbrightness and freshness of everything.And those merry girls beside\nme, who had the faculty of enjoying all they had, and all they did,\nwithout regretting what they had not or what they might not do--with\nheroic resignation they promised not to attempt to swim in the tempting\nsmooth water beyond the long rollers.Though knocked down again and\nagain, they always emerged from the waves with shouts of laughter.Mere\ndots they looked to my anxious eyes--a couple of corks tossed hither\nand thither on the foaming billows--and very thankful I was to get them\nsafe back into the \"drawing-room,\" the loveliest of lovely caves.There was no time to lose; by noon our parlour floor--what a fairy\nfloor it was!of the softest, most delicious sand--would be all covered\nwith waves.And before then there was a deal to be seen and done, the\nBellows, the Gull Rock, Asparagus Island--even if we left out the\ndangerous points with the ugly names that Curgenven had warned us\nagainst.What is there in humanity, certainly in youthful humanity, that if\nit can attain its end in two ways, one quiet and decorous, the other\ndifficult and dangerous, is certain to choose the latter?\"We must manage to get you to the Bellows, it is such a curious sight,\"\nsaid my girls as they returned from it.By dint of pulling, pushing, and the help of stick and arm, I came:\nstood watching the spout of water which, in certain conditions of the\ntide, forces itself through a tiny fissure in the rock with a great\nroar, and joined in the childish delight of waiting, minute by minute,\nfor the biggest spout, the loudest roar.But Asparagus Island (where was no asparagus at all) I totally\ndeclined.Not being a goat or a chamois, I contented myself with\nsitting where I could gain the best view of the almost invisible\npath by which my adventurous young \"kids\" disappeared.Happily they\nhad both steady heads and cool nerves; they were neither rash nor\nunconscientious.I knew they would come back as soon as they could.So\nI waited patiently, contemplating a fellow-victim who seemed worse off\nthan myself; a benign-looking clergyman, who kept walking up and down\nthe soppy sands, and shouting at intervals to two young people, a man\nand a woman, who appeared to be crawling like flies along the face of\nthe rock towards another rock, with a yawning cave and a wide fissure\nbetween.the clergyman cried at the top of his voice.\"Your young people seem rather venturesome,\" said I sympathetically.[Illustration: THE STEEPLE ROCK, KYNANCE COVE.]\"Not _my_ young people,\" was the dignified answer.\"My girls are up\nthere, on Asparagus Rock, which is easy enough climbing.They promised\nnot to go farther, and they never disobey their mother and me.I declare he is taking her to the most dangerous part, that\nrock where you have to jump--a good jump it is, and if you miss your\nfooting you are done for, you go right into the boiling waves below.Well, it's no business of mine; she is his own property; he is engaged\nto her, but\"--\n\nI fear I made some very severe remarks on the folly of a young man who\ncould thus risk life and limbs--not only his own, but those of his wife\nto be;

Woe the while\n                 That brought such wanderer to our isle.Woodward was a\nstrong-willed widower with five strong-willed sons and five\nstrong-willed daughters.The next four years Angeline was a sort of\nwhite slave in this family of wrangling brothers and sisters.When her\nsister Charlotte inquired how she liked her new home, her answer was\nsimply, \u201cMa\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nThe story of this second marriage of Electa Cook\u2019s is worthy of record.Any impatience toward her first husband of which she may have been\nguilty was avenged upon her a hundred-fold.And yet the second marriage\nwas a church affair.Woodward saw her at church and took a fancy to\nher.\u201cIt will make a home for you,\nMrs.Stickney,\u201d said the minister\u2014as if she were not the mistress of\nseventy-two acres in her own right!Why she gave up her independence it\nis difficult to see; but the ways of women are past finding out.Perhaps\nshe sympathized with the ten motherless Woodward children.Milton Woodward, for he was a man of violent temper, and\nsometimes abused her in glorious fashion.At the very outset, he opposed\nher bringing her unmarried daughters to his house.She insisted; but\nmight more wisely have yielded the point.For two of the daughters\nmarried their step-brothers, and shared the Woodward fate.Twelve-year old Angeline went to work very industriously at the Woodward\nfarm on Dry Hill.What the big, strapping Woodward girls could have been\ndoing it is hard to say\u2014wholly occupied with finding husbands, perhaps.For until 1847 Angeline was her mother\u2019s chief assistant, at times doing\nmost of the housework herself.She baked for the large family, mopped\nfloors, endured all sorts of drudgery, and even waded through the snow\nto milk cows.But with it all she attended school, and made great\nprogress.She liked grammar and arithmetic, and on one occasion showed\nher ability as a speller by spelling down the whole school.She even\nwent to singing school, and sang in the church choir.Some of the\nenvious Woodward children ridiculed the hard-working, ambitious girl by\ncalling her \u201cLady Angeline,\u201d a title which she lived up to from that\ntime forth.Let me reproduce here two of her compositions, written when she was\nfourteen years of age.They are addressed as letters to her teacher, Mr.George Waldo:\n\n                                               RODMAN, January 21st 1845\n\n    SIR, As you have requested me to write and have given me the\n    subjects upon which to write, I thought I would try to write what I\n    could about the Sugar Maple.The Sugar Maple is a very beautiful as\n    well as useful tree.In the summer the beasts retire to its kind\n    shade from the heat of the sun.And though the lofty Oak and pine\n    tower above it, perhaps they are no more useful.Sugar is made from\n    the sap of this tree, which is a very useful article.It is also\n    used for making furniture such as tables bureaus &c. and boards for\n    various uses.It is also used to cook Our victuals and to keep us\n    warm.But its usefulness does not stop here even the ashes are\n    useful; they are used for making potash which with the help of flint\n    or sand and a good fire to melt it is made into glass which people\n    could not very well do without.Glass is good to help the old to see\n    and to give light to our houses.Besides all this teliscopes are\n    made of glass by the help of which about all the knowledge of the\n    mighty host of planetary worlds has been discovered.In the first place sugar is made from it.Then it gives us all sorts of beautiful furniture.Then it warms our\n    houses and cooks our victuals and then even then we get something\n    from the ashes yes something very useful.Teacher\u2019s comment:\n\n    I wish there was a good deal more.The next composition is as follows:\n\n                                SLAVERY.RODMAN February 17th 1845\n\n    Slavery or holding men in bondage is one of the most unjust\n    practices.But unjust as it is even in this boasted land of liberty\n    many of our greatest men are dealers in buying and selling slaves.Were you to go to the southern states you would see about every\n    dwelling surrounded by plantations on which you would see the half\n    clothed and half starved slave and his master with whip in hand\n    ready to inflict the blow should the innocent child forgetful of the\n    smart produced by the whip pause one moment to hear the musick of\n    the birds inhale the odor of the flowers or through fatigue should\n    let go his hold from the hoe.And various other scenes that none but\n    the hardest hearted could behold without dropping a tear of pity for\n    the fate of the slave would present themselves probably you would\n    see the slave bound in chains and the driver urging him onward while\n    every step he takes is leading him farther and farther from his home\n    and all that he holds dear.But I hope these cruelties will soon\n    cease as many are now advocating the cause of the slave.But still\n    there are many that forget that freedom is as dear to the slave as\n    to the master, whose fathers when oppressed armed in defence of\n    liberty and with Washington at their head gained it.But to their\n    shame they still hold slaves.But some countries have renounced\n    slavery and I hope their example will be followed by our own.Teacher\u2019s comment:\n\n    I hope so too.When men shall learn to do unto\n    others as they themselves wish to be done unto.And not only say but\n    _do_ and that _more than_ HALF as they say.Then we may hope to see\n    the slave Liberated, and _not_ till _then_._Write again._\n\nThe composition on slavery (like the mention of the telescope) is in the\nnature of a prophecy, for our astronomer\u2019s wife during her residence of\nthirty years in Washington was an unfailing friend of the <DW64>.Many a\nNortherner, coming into actual contact with the black man, has learned\nto despise him more than Southerners do.The conviction\nof childhood, born of reading church literature on slavery and of\nhearing her step-father\u2019s indignant words on the subject\u2014for he was an\nardent abolitionist\u2014lasted through life.In the fall of 1847 the ambitious school-girl had a stroke of good\nfortune.Her cousin Harriette Downs, graduate of a young ladies\u2019 school\nin Pittsfield, Mass., took an interest in her, and paid her tuition for\nthree terms at the Rodman Union Seminary.So Angeline worked for her\nboard at her Aunt Clary Downs\u2019, a mile and a half from the seminary, and\nwalked to school every morning.A delightful walk in autumn; but when\nthe deep snows came, it was a dreadful task to wade through the drifts.Her skirts would get wet, and she took a severe cold.She never forgot\nthe hardships of that winter.The next winter she lived in Rodman\nvillage, close to the seminary, working for her board at a Mr.Wood\u2019s,\nwhere on Monday mornings she did the family washing before school began.How thoroughly she enjoyed the modest curriculum of studies at the\nseminary none can tell save those who have worked for an education as\nhard as she did.That she was appreciated and beloved by her schoolmates\nmay be inferred from the following extracts from a letter dated\nHenderson, Jefferson Co., N.Y., January 9, 1848:\n\n    Our folks say they believe you are perfect or I would not say so\n    much about you.They would like to have you come out here & stay a\n    wek, they say but not half as much as I would I dont believe, come\n    come come.... Your letter I have read over & over again, ther seems\n    to be such a smile.I almost immagin I can\n    see you & hear you talk while I am reading your letter.... Those\n    verses were beautiful, they sounded just lik you.... Good Night for\n    I am shure you will say you never saw such a boched up mess\n\n    I ever remain your sincere friend\n\n            E. A. BULFINCH.No doubt as to the genuineness of this document!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.Angeline had indeed\nbegun to write verses\u2014and as a matter of interest rather than as an\nexample of art, I venture to quote the following lines, written in\nOctober, 1847:\n\n             Farewell, a long farewell, to thee sweet grove,\n             To thy cool shade and grassy seat I love;\n             Farewell, for the autumnal breeze is sighing\n             Among thy boughs, and low thy leaves are lying.Farewell, farewell, until another spring\n             Rolls round again, and thy sweet bowers ring\n             With song of birds, and wild flowers spring,\n             And on the gentle breeze their odors fling.Farewell, perhaps I ne\u2019er again may view\n             Thy much-loved haunt, so then a sweet adieu.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                            TEACHING SCHOOL.In the North teaching follows schooling almost as a matter of course.In\n1848 Angeline Stickney began to teach the district school in Heath\nHollow, near Rodman, for a dollar and a quarter a week and board.The\nsame year she taught also at Pleasant Valley, near Cape Vincent, whither\nEdwin Ingalls had moved.Angeline boarded with her sister and spun her\nwool.Would that some artist had painted this nineteenth century\nPriscilla at the spinning-wheel!For the next nine years, that is, until\na year after her marriage, she was alternately teacher and pupil.In the\nwinter of 1849-50 she tutored in the family of Elder Bright, who six\nyears later, in Wisconsin, performed her marriage ceremony.In the\nwinter of 1850-51 she attended the seminary at Rodman, together with her\nsister Ruth.An excellent teacher always, she won the respect and affection of her\npupils.After her death a sturdy farmer of Rodman told me, with great\nfeeling, how much he liked the patient teacher.He was a dull boy, and\nfound many perplexities in arithmetic, which Miss Stickney carefully\nexplained.And so she became the boy\u2019s ideal woman.Very seldom did she\nhave to resort to punishment, but when punishment was necessary she did\nnot flinch.The same might be said of her in the rearing of her four\nsons.Her gentleness, united to a resolute will and thorough goodness of\nheart, made obedience to her word an acknowledged and sacred duty.The following fragment of a letter, written after she had begun her\ncollege course at McGrawville, gives a glimpse of her at this period:\n\n                                                 WATERTOWN Nov.27th \u201952\n\n   ... it is half past eight A.M.I\n    have had but fourteen scholars yet, but expect more next week.Sister Ruth teaches in the district adjoining this.I see her often,\n    have been teaching two weeks.I do not have a very good opportunity\n    for studying, or reciting.There is a gentleman living about a mile\n    and a half from me to whom I suppose I might recite, but the road is\n    bad and so I have to content myself without a teacher, and I fear I\n    shall not make much progress in my studies this winter.Saturday Dec\n    4th.... I do not teach to-day, so I started off in the rain this\n    morning to come and see Sister Ruth.It is about a mile and a half\n    across through swamp and woods, but I had a very fine walk after\n    all.I had to climb a hill on the way, that may well vie in height\n    with the hills of McGrawville, and the prospect from its summit is\n    the finest I ever saw.Sister saw me coming and came running to meet\n    me and now we are sitting side by side in her school room with none\n    to molest us.... I board around the district.... Oh!how I long for\n    a quiet little room, where I might write and study....\n\nLet me add here an extract from a brief diary kept in 1851, which\nillustrates a phase of her character hardly noticed thus far.She was,\nlike the best young women of her day and generation, intensely\nreligious\u2014even morbidly so, perhaps.But as sincerity is the saving\ngrace of all religions", "question": "Where is John?

I intended to go to Lockport to teach\n    painting to-day, but the stage left before I was ready to go, so I\n    came back home.Ruth and I had our daguerreotypes taken to-day.David here when we arrived at home to carry Ruth to her school.Vandervort came up after the horses\n    and sleigh to go to Mr.He said he would carry me to\n    Watertown and I could take the stage for Lockport, but the stage had\n    left about half an hour before we arrived there, so Mr.Vandervort\n    said he would bring me up in the evening.We started after tea and\n    arrived here in safety, but too late to do anything towards getting\n    a class.Granger the landlord told me I had\n    better go and get Miss Cobe to assist me in getting a class.She\n    called with me at several places.Did not get much encouragement, so\n    I thought best to go to Felts Mills in the afternoon.Tavern bill 3\n    shillings, fare from Lockport to the Mills 2 s.

Anthony and Horace\nGreeley.Of that hard-hitting Unitarian minister and noble poet, John\nPierpont, she wrote, at the time of her graduation:\n\n    The Rev.He preached in the chapel Sunday\n    forenoon.He is\n    over seventy years old, but is as straight as can be, and his face\n    is as fresh as a young man\u2019s.Little did she dream that this ardent patriot would one day march into\nWashington at the head of a New Hampshire regiment, and break bread at\nher table.Nor could she foresee that her college friends Oscar Fox and\nA. J. Warner would win laurels on the battlefields of Bull Run and\nAntietam, vindicating their faith with their blood.Both giants in\nstature, Captain Fox carried a minie-ball in his breast for forty years,\nand Colonel Warner, shot through the hip, was saved by a miracle of\nsurgery.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.Of her classmates\u2014there were only four, all men, who graduated\nwith her\u2014she wrote:\n\n    I think I have three as noble classmates as you will find in any\n    College, they are Living Men.It is amusing to turn from college friends to college studies\u2014such a\ncontrast between the living men and their academic labors.For example,\nAngeline Stickney took the degree of A.B.in July, 1855, having entered\ncollege, with a modest preparation, in April, 1852, and having been\nabsent about a year, from November, 1852 to September, 1853, when she\nentered the Junior Class.It is recorded that she studied Virgil the\nsummer of 1852; the fall of 1853, German, Greek, and mathematical\nastronomy; the next term, Greek and German; and the next term, ending\nJuly 12, 1854, Greek, natural philosophy, German and surveying.She\nbegan her senior year with calculus, philosophy, natural and mental, and\nAnthon\u2019s Homer, and during that year studied also Wayland\u2019s Political\nEconomy and Butler\u2019s Analogy.She is also credited with work done in\ndeclamation and composition, and \u201ctwo orations performed.\u201d Her marks, as\nfar as my incomplete records show, were all perfect, save that for one\nterm she was marked 98 per cent in Greek.Upon the credit slip for the\nlast term her \u201cstanding\u201d is marked \u201c1\u201d; and her \u201cconduct\u201d whenever\nmarked is always 100.However, be it observed that Angeline Stickney not only completed the\ncollege curriculum at McGrawville, but also taught classes in\nmathematics.In fact, her future husband was one of her pupils, and has\nborne witness that she was a \u201cgood, careful teacher.\u201d\n\nIf McGrawville was not distinguished for high thinking, it could at\nleast lay claim to plain living.Let us inquire into the ways and means\nof the Stickney sisters.I have already stated that board and lodging\ncost the two together only one dollar a week.They wrote home to their\nmother, soon after their arrival:\n\n    We are situated in the best place possible for studying domestic\n    economy.We bought a quart of milk, a pound of crackers, and a sack\n    of flour this morning.Tuition for a term of three months was only five dollars; and poor\nstudents were encouraged to come and earn their way through college.Ruth returned home after one term, and Angeline worked for her board at\na Professor Kingley\u2019s, getting victuals, washing dishes, and sweeping.Even so, after two terms her slender means were exhausted, and she went\nhome to teach for a year.Returning to college in September, 1853, she\ncompleted the course in two years, breaking down at last for lack of\nrecreation and nourishment.Ruth returned to McGrawville in 1854, and\nwrote home: \u201c", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "We are going to board\nourselves at Mr.Smith\u2019s.\u201d And Angeline herself wrote: \u201cMy health has\nbeen quite good ever since I came here.It agrees with me to study....\nWe have a very pleasant boarding place, just far enough from the college\nfor a pleasant walk.\u201d\n\nAngeline was not selfishly ambitious, but desired her sister\u2019s education\nas well as her own.Before the bar of her Puritanical conscience she may\nhave justified her own ambition by being ambitious for her sister.In\nthe fall of 1853 she wrote to Ruth:\n\n    I hope you will make up your mind to come out here to school next\n    spring.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.You can go through college as well as I. As soon as I get\n    through I will help you.You can go through the scientific course, I\n    should think, in two years after next spring term if you should come\n    that term.Then we would be here a year together, and you would get\n    a pretty good start.There seems to be a way opening for me to get\n    into good business as soon as I get through college.And again, in January, 1854:\n\n    Ruth, I believe I am more anxious to have you come to school than I\n    ever was before.I see how much it will increase your influence, and\n    suffering humanity calls for noble spirits to come to its aid.And I\n    would like to have you fitted for an efficient laborer.I know you\n    have intellect, and I would have it disciplined and polished.Come\n    and join the little band of reformers here, will you not?Sometimes I get very lonely here, and I never should,\n    if you were only here.Tell me in your next letter that you will\n    come.I will help you all I can in every thing.But Ruth lacked her sister\u2019s indomitable will.She loved her, and wished\nto be with her, whether at home or at college.Indeed, in a letter to\nAngeline she said she would tease very hard to have her come home, did\nshe not realize how her heart was set upon getting an education.Ruth\ndid return to McGrawville in 1854, but remained only two months, on\naccount of poor health.The student fare did not agree with the vigorous\nRuth, apparently; and she now gave up further thought of college, and\ngenerously sought to help her sister what she could financially.Though a dime at McGrawville was equivalent to a dollar elsewhere,\nAngeline was much cramped for money, and to complete her course was\nobliged finally to borrow fifty dollars from her cousin Joseph Downs,\ngiving her note payable in one year.When her breakdown came, six weeks\nbefore graduation, Ruth, like a good angel, came and took her home.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.It\nwas a case of sheer exhaustion, aggravated by a tremendous dose of\nmedicine administered by a well-meaning friend.Though she returned to\nMcGrawville and graduated with her class, even producing a sorry sort of\npoem for the commencement exercises, it was two or three years before\nshe regained her health.Such was a common experience among ambitious\nAmerican students fifty years ago, before the advent of athletics and\ngymnasiums.In closing this chapter, I will quote a character sketch written by one\nof Angeline\u2019s classmates:\n\n    _Slate Pencil Sketches\u2014No.L. A. C\u2014and C. A. Stickney._ Miss C\u2014\n    is Professor of Rhetoric, and Miss Stickney is a member of the\n    Senior Class, in N.Y.A description of their\n    personal appearance may not be allowable; besides it could not be\n    attracting, since the element of Beauty would not enter largely into\n    the sketch.Both are fortunately removed to a safe distance from\n    Beauty of the Venus type; though the truth may not be quite\n    apparent, because the adornments of mind by the force of association\n    have thrown around them the Quakerish veil of _good looks_ (to use\n    moderate terms), which answers every desirable end of the most\n    charming attractions, besides effectually saving both from the folly\n    of Pride.Nevertheless, the writer of this sketch can have no\n    earthly object in concealing his appreciation of the high brow, and\n    Nymphean make of the one, and the lustrous eye of the other.said the gentleman; 'your mistress' gown is dusty.'\"Jack instantly took a small brush from his master's pocket, raised the\nhem of the lady's dress, cleaned it, and then did the same to his\nmaster's shoes, which were also dusty.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.\"When they gave him any thing to eat, he did not cram his pouches with\nit, but delicately and tidily devoured it; and when, as frequently\noccurred, strangers gave him money, he always put it in his master's\nhands.\"\"Do you think, mamma, I could teach Jacko to do so?\"\"I can't say, my dear; and indeed I think it would be hardly worth the\npains to spend a great deal of time in teaching him.He seems to learn\nquite fast enough by himself.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.Indeed, he is so full of tricks, and so\ntroublesome to cook in hiding her kitchen utensils, I am afraid we shall\nhave to put him in close confinement.\"\"I had rather uncle Frank would carry him back to Africa,\" sighed the\nchild.\"Well, dear, I wouldn't grieve about it now.We must manage somehow till\nuncle Frank comes, and then perhaps he can tell us what to do.\"A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome\nthat the servants were constantly complaining.\"\"That seems similar to our case,\" said the lady, smiling, as she\ninterrupted the reading.\"One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into\nthe next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately\nopen.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,\nlaces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away\nvigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be\nfound in the room.\"When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in\nspreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry.\"He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to\nhim, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case\nof the large kitchen clock.\"The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his\nplace of refuge when he was in disgrace.\"One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for\ndinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon\nmanaged to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam\nfowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and\nbegan plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the\nservants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in\nsuch a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,\n\"I wonder how old that monkey was.\"\"The book does not mention his age, my dear.\"I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;\nand then I said to myself, 'That one must have been young.'\"\"If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,\"\nremarked the lady.\"His company does not begin to compensate for the\ntrouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and\ntractable.\"\"And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?\"\"I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better\nkind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny\ntricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I\nknew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I\nshould be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; \"O, mamma, I wouldn't\nhave one of my pets killed for any thing.\"Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie's fate, but\nshe wisely said nothing.I don't want to think about such awful\nthings.\"The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently\nshe said, \"Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but\nfirst I must explain to you what a sounding-board is.\"In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the\npulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was\nthought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the\ncongregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my\ngrandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a\nsounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would\nfall on the minister's head and kill him.\"There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept\nin his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,\nwhich was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he\nwent out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out\nof sight, on his way to church.\"But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under\nhis arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the\nopportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,\nran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board.\"Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on\nthe congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle.\"The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much\nenjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the\nsounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was\nunconscious of his presence.\"When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with\nlaughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it\nhis duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action\nof his hands and arms.\"The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every\nmotion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the\ncountenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the\nmost solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity\nappear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,\nevery word being enforced by great energy of action.\"All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with\nardor and exactness.\"The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man\nand his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of\ncomposure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one\nof the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the\nirreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the\nmerriment.\"Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal\nstanding on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his\nmight, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly\nexasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey\nremoved, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to\nrecover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed.\"CHAPTER V.\n\nJACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching\nmice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to\ngood account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,\ndetermined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,\nand shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his\ncomfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every\nthing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and\nwell secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this\ntreatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup\ntureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over\nthe place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke\nshivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup\ntureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he\nbegan to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on\nthe upper shelf.\"There is something good,\" he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,\nraspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,\ndisappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in\na corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave\na scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a\nthousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her\nthat this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,\nwho began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his\nstomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his\nexcess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an\nexperiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new\nmischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,\nlaughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as\nhe said, \"We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;\nbut you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.\"\"Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?\"\"I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I\ncan find any for you.\"He opened the book, and then asked,--\n\n\"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in\ntheir cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the\nanimal look wrinkled?\"\"No, sir; I never heard about it.\"He puts his food in them, and keeps it there\ntill he wishes to devour it.\"There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;\nthat is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,\nand which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The\nfacility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the\nbranches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it\nmakes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,\nit is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it\nto swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.\"\"I'm sure, father,\" eagerly cried Minnie, \"that Jacko has a prehensile\ntail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the\nhay mow.\"But here is an\naccount of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black\nhands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called\nHoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be\none of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to\ndeath; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy\ngreat quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by\nthe natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone\nwould compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us\nthat their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are\nraised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in\nwhich they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A\nhand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum\nin Paris.\"\"Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures\nor hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other\nsubstances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they\ndo not", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.\"Mamma,\" she\nexclaimed, \"cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families.\"I suppose, my dear,\" she responded, \"that there is a\ndifference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very\nfond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount\nthem on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection.\"But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,\nand if I can find the book, I will read it to you.\"\"There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most\nbeautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from\nits extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at\nliberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in\norder to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a\nwife.\"For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every\nattention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much\ncruelty.\"One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than\nusual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,\nafter winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and\ndrew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave\nher a push, which threw her into the sea.\"This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he\ndescended in high spirits.\"\"I should think they would have punished him,\" said Minnie, with great\nindignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no\nmeans always to be depended upon.\"Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one\nmore story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,\ncomplied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this\nchapter on Minnie's pet monkey.\"A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented\nto his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.\"Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress\nused sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him\nrun up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper.\"On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,\nran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and\nchattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,\n'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally\nleaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled\nhimself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth\nopen, his sides ready to burst with his running.\"Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former\nexperience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at\ncleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the\nhandle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he\nrelinquished the sport.\"Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and\nboots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering\nall the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole\nand all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &\nMartin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was\na nice mess for some days after.\"One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found\nSprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and\narranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he\nheard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as\nthough nothing had happened.Occasionally a bowl of water was\ngiven him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his\nfinger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the\nother, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed\nhimself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped\nout and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during\nthis performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his\nmight to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over\nthem.As he was brought from a\nvery warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the\ncold.\"The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his\nbasket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning\nhe frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of\nmaking the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet.\"One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on\nthe tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her.\"Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from\nhis basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it\njust the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving\nonly his head above the water.\"This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water\nbegan to grow hot.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly\nsat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have\nbeen boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and\nfirmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,\nwho, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head\nand pulled him out.\"He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon\nrecovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot\nexperience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire.\"When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a\nmenagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was\ngreatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty\nquestions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their\nway home, she inquired,--\n\n\"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?\"\"Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot\nconceive of.\"\"I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets,\" added her\nmother, laughing.\"I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,\"\nanswered the child.\"But, father, will you please tell me something\nmore about the curious animals?\"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had\nstopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered\nabout some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to\nget out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,\nand then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.He had been in\nthe road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had\ngone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which\nMinnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like\nher.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it\nseemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he\nfound her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave\nJohn orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering\nwhether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy\npaid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature\nmust be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many\nadmonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her\nthoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the\nanimal, which he read to her.\"The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like\nhead, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.The form\nand position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and\nhands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as\nit is disgusting.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.\"Then follows an account,\" the gentleman went on, \"of the peculiarities\nof different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.\"\"But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?\"\"I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that\nthey are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper.\"They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the\nseverest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to\ntheir own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions\nare cruel, destructive, and disgusting.\"\"I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples,\" said Minnie; \"but\nhe did not give them any meat all the time I was there.\"\"No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable\nmatter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of\nGood Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to\ndestroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and\ngardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the\ndogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the\ngun.\"As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage\nincreases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible\nfury.\"\"Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking\nencyclopaedia.\"Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless\nthey go into gardens?\"\"I rather think I should soon convince them they\nwere not to enter my garden,\" he said, emphatically.\"But seriously,\nthey descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in\na few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,\nthey move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to\ngive notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,\nthe sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with\nthe greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into\ntheir cheek pouches.\"Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her\nmother said, \"I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named\nKees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.\"\"Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,\"\nsaid the gentleman, rising.\"It was in a book of travels in Africa,\" the lady went on.\"The\ntraveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his\njourney, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a\nsentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his\nsense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of\nprey, when every thing was apparently secure.\"There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they\ncame across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were\nunacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he\nthrew them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or\ndisagreeable, and left them untasted.\"Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these\nexcursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the\nsport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he\nshowed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance\nabout, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was\nvery fond.\"I recall one amusing trick of Kees,\" said the lady, laughing, \"which\npleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows\nof trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of\nwhich his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he\nwould run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it\nas fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him.\"These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner\nof doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong\nteeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself\ngradually back, which forced it from the earth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.If it proved stubborn,\nwhile he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,\nwhich gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come\nout.\"Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired\nwith the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the\ndogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew\nweary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into\nservice.As soon as Kees leaped on\nhis back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the\nspot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until\nthe party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great\nhaste to overtake their master.\"Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were\naccustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the\nslightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their\nplaces about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them\ncame too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,\nand thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.\"\"Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed,\" said Minnie,\nwith considerable warmth.\"I have told you the best traits of his character,\" she answered,\nsmiling.\"He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He\ncould not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He\nunderstood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take\nthe cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it\nwhenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these\nmisdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good.\"Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his\nservants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any\nthing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,\ngenerally deserved it.\"The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the\nplace; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the\nbroken shell.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a\nsevere beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the\ngentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as\nsoon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast.\"One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of\na bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had\ncarefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran\nout of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,\nbut found not a bean left, and Kees missing.\"When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some\nhours; but, this time, he hid himself for several

My children ought to kiss her very\nsteps; for my part, I have no gift for education.She has such a gift,\nthat I look upon it as nothing less than the eighth endowment of the\nHoly Ghost; I mean a certain fond persecution by which it is given her\nto torment her children from morning to night to do something, not to do\nsomething, to learn--and yet without for a moment losing their tender\naffection for her.She was\nlaughingly called by himself and her friends, Madame Prudence.It is\ncertain that few women have found more necessity for the qualities\nimplied in this creditable nickname.They had not been married many years before they were overtaken by\nirreparable disaster.The French Revolution broke out, and Savoy was\ninvaded by the troops of the new Republic.Count De Maistre, with his\nwife and children, fled from Chambery across the Alps to Aosta.'_Ma\nchere amie_,' he said to his wife, by the side of a great rock which he\nnever afterwards forgot, 'the step that we are taking to-day is\nirrevocable; it decides our lot for life;' and the presentiment was\ntrue.Soon the _Loi des Allobroges_ was promulgated, which enjoined upon\nall who had left their homes in Savoy to return instantly, under pain of\nconfiscation of all their property.Madame de Maistre was in the ninth month of her pregnancy.She knew that\nher husband would endure anything rather than expose her to the risks of\na journey in such a season.So, urged by a desire to save something from\nthe wreck of their fortune by compliance with the French decree, she\nseized the opportunity of her husband's absence at Turin, and started\nfor Savoy without acquainting him with her design.Bernard in the beginning of January on the back of a mule,\naccompanied by her two little children wrapped in blankets.The Count,\non his return to Aosta two or three days afterwards, forthwith set off\nin her steps, in the trembling expectation of finding her dead or dying\nin some Alpine hovel.But the favour of fate and a stout heart brought\nher safe to Chambery, where shortly afterwards she was joined by her\nhusband.The authorities vainly tendered him the oath, vainly bade him\ninscribe his name on the register of citizens; and when they asked him\nfor a contribution to support the war, he replied curtly that he did not\ngive money to kill his brothers in the service of the King of Sardinia.As soon as his wife was delivered of their third child, whom he was\ndestined not to see again for nearly twenty years, he quitted her side,\nabandoned his property and his country, and took refuge at Lausanne,\nwhere in time his wife and his two eldest children once more came to\nhim.Gibbon tells us how a swarm of emigrants, escaping from the public ruin,\nwas attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the language of\nLausanne.'They are entitled to our pity,' he reflected, 'and they may\nclaim our esteem, but they cannot in their present state of mind and\nfortune contribute much to our amusement.Instead of looking down as\ncalm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our domestic harmony\nis somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit.'Gibbon died in\nLondon almost at the very moment that De Maistre arrived at Lausanne,\nbut his account of things remained true, and political feuds continued\nto run as high as ever.Among the people with whom De Maistre was thrown\nwas Madame de Stael.'As we had not been to the same school,' he says,\n'either in theology or in politics, we had some scenes enough to make\none die of laughter; still without quarrelling.Her father, who was then\nalive, was the friend and relative of people that I love with all my\nheart, and that I would not vex for all the world.So I allowed the\n_emigres_ who surrounded us to cry out as they would, without ever\ndrawing the sword.'De Maistre thought he never came across a head so\ncompletely turned wrong as Madame de Stael's, the infallible\nconsequence, as he took it to be, of modern philosophy operating upon a\nwoman's nature.if Madame de Stael had been\nCatholic, she would have been adorable, instead of famous.'We can\nbelieve that his position among the French _emigres_ was not\nparticularly congenial.For though they hated the Revolution, they had\nall drunk of the waters of the eighteenth century philosophy, and De\nMaistre hated this philosophy worse than he hated the Revolution itself.Then again, they would naturally vapour about the necessities of strong\ngovernment.'Yes,' said the Savoyard exile, 'but be quite sure that, to\nmake the monarchy strong, you must rest it on the laws, avoiding\neverything arbitrary, too frequent commissions, and all ministerial\njobberies.'We may well believe how unsavoury this rational and just\ntalk was to people who meant by strong government a system that should\nrestore to them their old prerogatives of anti-social oppression and\nselfish corruption.The order that De Maistre vindicated was a very\ndifferent thing from the deadly and poisonous order which was the object\nof the prayers of the incorrigible royalists around him.After staying three years at Lausanne, De Maistre went to Turin, but\nshortly afterwards the Sardinian king, at the end of a long struggle,\nwas forced to succumb to the power of the French, then in the full tide\nof success.Bonaparte's brilliant Italian campaign needs no words here.The French entered Turin, and De Maistre, being an _emigre_, had to\nleave it.Furnished with a false passport, and undergoing a thousand\nhardships and dangers, he made his way, once more in the depth of a\nsevere winter (1797), to Venice.He went part of the way down the Po in\na small trading ship, crowded with ladies, priests, monks, soldiers, and\na bishop.There was only one small fire on board, at which all the\ncooking had to be done, and where the unhappy passengers had to keep\nthemselves warm as they could.At night they were confined each to a\nspace about three planks broad, separated from neighbours by pieces of\ncanvas hanging from a rope above.Each bank of the river was lined by\nmilitary posts--the left by the Austrians, and the right by the French;\nand the danger of being fired into was constantly present to aggravate\nthe misery of overcrowding, scanty food, and bitter cold.Even this\nwretchedness was surpassed by the hardships which confronted the exiles\nat Venice.The physical distress endured here by De Maistre and his\nunfortunate family exceeded that of any other period of their\nwanderings.He was cut off from the court, and from all his relations\nand friends, and reduced for the means of existence to a few fragments\nof silver plate, which had somehow been saved from the universal wreck.This slender resource grew less day by day, and when that was exhausted\nthe prospect was a blank.The student of De Maistre's philosophy may see\nin what crushing personal anguish some of its most sinister growths had\ntheir roots.When the cares of beggary come suddenly upon a man in\nmiddle life, they burn very deep.Alone, and starving for a cause that\nis dear to him, he might encounter the grimness of fate with a fortitude\nin which there should be many elevating and consoling elements.But the\ndestiny is intolerably hard which condemns a man of humane mould, as De\nMaistre certainly was, to look helplessly on the physical pains of a\ntender woman and famishing little ones.The anxieties that press upon\nhis heart in such calamity as this are too sharp, too tightened, and too\nsordid for him to draw a single free breath, or to raise his eyes for a\nsingle moment of relief from the monstrous perplexity that chokes him.The hour of bereavement has its bitterness, but the bitterness is\ngradually suffused with soft reminiscence.The grip of beggary leaves a\nmark on such a character as De Maistre's which no prosperity of after\ndays effaces.The seeming inhumanity of his theory of life, which is so\nrevolting to comfortable people like M. Villemain, was in truth the only\nexplanation of his own cruel sufferings in which he could find any\nsolace.It was not that he hated mankind, but that his destiny looked as\nif God hated him, and this was a horrible moral complexity out of which\nhe could only extricate himself by a theory in which pain and torment\nseem to stand out as the main facts in human existence.Hope smiled on him momentarily,\nbut, in his own words: 'It was only a flash in the night.'While he was\nin Venice, the armies of Austria and Russia reconquered the north of\nItaly, and Charles Emanuel IV., in the natural anticipation that the\nallies would at once restore his dominions, hastened forward.Austria,\nhowever, as De Maistre had seen long before, was indifferent or even\nabsolutely hostile to Sardinian interests, and she successfully opposed\nCharles Emanuel's restoration.The king received the news of the perfidy\nof his nominal ally at Florence, but not until after he had made\narrangements for rewarding the fidelity of some of his most loyal\nadherents.It was from Florence that De Maistre received the king's nomination to\nthe chief place in the government of the island of Sardinia.Through the\nshort time of his administration here, he was overwhelmed with vexations\nonly a little more endurable than the physical distresses which had\nweighed him down at Venice.During the war, justice had been\nadministered in a grossly irregular manner.Hence, people had taken the\nlaw into their own hands, and retaliation had completed the round of\nwrong-doing.The higher\nclass exhibited an invincible repugnance to paying their debts.Some of\nthese difficulties in the way of firm and orderly government were\ninsuperable, and De Maistre vexed his soul in an unequal and only\npartially successful contest.In after years, amid the miseries of his\nlife in Russia, he wrote to his brother thus: 'Sometimes in moments of\nsolitude that I multiply as much as I possibly can, I throw my head back\non the cushion of my sofa, and there with my four walls around me, far\nfrom all that is dear to me, confronted by a sombre and impenetrable\nfuture, I recall the days when in a little town that you know well'--", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "little men and little things, I used to ask myself: \"Am I then condemned\nto live and die in this place, like a limpet on a rock?\"I suffered\nbitterly; my head was overloaded, wearied, flattened, by the enormous\nweight of Nothing.'In 1802 he received an order\nfrom the king to proceed to St.Petersburg as envoy extraordinary and\nminister plenipotentiary at the court of Russia.Even from this bitter\nproof of devotion to his sovereign he did not shrink.He had to tear\nhimself from his wife and children, without any certainty when so cruel\na separation would be likely to end; to take up new functions which the\ncircumstances of the time rendered excessively difficult; while the\npetty importance of the power he represented, and its mendicant attitude\nin Europe, robbed his position of that public distinction and dignity\nwhich may richly console a man for the severest private sacrifice.It is\na kind destiny which veils their future from mortal men.Fifteen years\npassed before De Maistre's exile came to a close.From 1802 to 1817 he\ndid not quit the inhospitable latitudes of northern Russia.De Maistre's letters during this desolate period furnish a striking\npicture of his manner of life and his mental state.We see in them his\nmost prominent characteristics strongly marked.Not even the\npainfulness of the writer's situation ever clouds his intrepid and\nvigorous spirit.Lively and gallant sallies of humour to his female\nfriends, sagacious judgments on the position of Europe to political\npeople, bits of learned criticism for erudite people, tender and playful\nchat with his two daughters, all these alternate with one another with\nthe most delightful effect.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Whether he is writing to his little girl\nwhom he has never known, or to the king of Sardinia, or to some author\nwho sends him a book, or to a minister who has found fault with his\ndiplomacy, there is in all alike the same constant and remarkable play\nof a bright and penetrating intellectual light, coloured by a humour\nthat is now and then a little sardonic, but more often is genial and\nlambent.There is a certain semi-latent quality of hardness lying at the\nbottom of De Maistre's style, both in his letters and in his more\nelaborate compositions.His writings seem to recall the flavour and\nbouquet of some of the fortifying and stimulating wines of Burgundy,\nfrom which time and warmth have not yet drawn out a certain native\nroughness that lingers on the palate.This hardness, if one must give\nthe quality a name that only imperfectly describes it, sprang not from\nany original want of impressionableness or sensibility of nature, but\npartly from the relentless buffetings which he had to endure at the\nhands of fortune, and partly from the preponderance which had been given\nto the rational side of his mind by long habits of sedulous and accurate\nstudy.Few men knew so perfectly as he knew how to be touching without\nceasing to be masculine, nor how to go down into the dark pits of human\nlife without forgetting the broad sunlight, nor how to keep habitually\nclose to visible and palpable fact while eagerly addicted to\nspeculation.His contemplations were perhaps somewhat too near the\nground; they led him into none of those sublimer regions of subtle\nfeeling where the rarest human spirits have loved to travel; we do not\nthink of his mind among those who have gone\n\n    Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.If this kind of temper, strong, keen, frank, and a little hard and\nmordent, brought him too near a mischievous disbelief in the dignity of\nmen and their lives, at least it kept him well away from morbid weakness\nin ethics, and from beating the winds in metaphysics.But of this we\nshall see more in considering his public pieces than can be gathered\nfrom his letters.The discomforts of De Maistre's life at St.The\ndignity of his official style and title was an aggravation of the\nexceeding straitness of his means.The ruined master could do little to\nmitigate the ruin of his servant.He had to keep up the appearance of an\nambassador on the salary of a clerk.'This is the second winter,' he\nwrites to his brother in 1810, 'that I have gone through without a\npelisse, which is exactly like going without a shirt at Cagliari.When I\ncome from court a very sorry lackey throws a common cloak over my\nshoulders.'The climate suited him better than he had expected; and in\none letter he vows that he was the only living being in Russia who had\npassed two winters without fur boots and a fur hat.It was considered\nindispensable that he should keep a couple of servants; so, for his\nsecond, De Maistre was obliged to put up with a thief, whom he rescued\nunder the shelter of ambassadorial privilege from the hands of justice,\non condition that he would turn honest.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.The Austrian ambassador, with\nwhom he was on good terms, would often call to take him out to some\nentertainment.'His fine servants mount my staircase groping their way\nin the dark, and we descend preceded by a servant carrying _luminare\nminus quam ut praeesset nocti_.''I am certain,' he adds pleasantly,\n'that they make songs about me in their Austrian patois.it\nis well they can amuse themselves.'Sometimes he was reduced so far as to share the soup of his valet, for\nlack of richer and more independent fare.Then he was constantly fretted\nby enemies at home, who disliked his trenchant diplomacy, and distrusted\nthe strength and independence of a mind which was too vigorous to please\nthe old-fashioned ministers of the Sardinian court.These chagrins he\ntook as a wise man should.They disturbed him less than his separation\nfrom his family.'Six hundred leagues away from you all,' he writes to\nhis brother, 'the thoughts of my family, the reminiscences of childhood,\ntransport me with sadness.'Visions of his mother's saintly face\nhaunted his chamber; almost gloomier still was the recollection of old\nintimates with whom he had played, lived, argued, and worked for years,\nand yet who now no longer bore him in mind.There are not many glimpses\nof this melancholy in the letters meant for the eye of his beloved\n_trinite feminine_, as he playfully called his wife and two daughters.'_A quoi bon vous attrister_,' he asked bravely, '_sans raison et sans\nprofit?_' Occasionally he cannot help letting out to them how far his\nmind is removed from composure.'Every day as I return home I found my\nhouse as desolate as if it was yesterday you left me.In society the\nsame fancy pursues me, and scarcely ever quits me.'Music, as might be\nsurmised in so sensitive a nature, drove him almost beside himself with\nits mysterious power of intensifying the dominant emotion.'Whenever by\nany chance I hear the harpsichord,' he says,'melancholy seizes me.The\nsound of the violin gives me such a heavy heart, that I am fain to leave\nthe company and hasten home.'He tossed in his bed at night, thinking he\nheard the sound of weeping at Turin, making a thousand efforts to\npicture to himself the looks of that 'orphan child of a living father'\nwhom he had never known, wondering if ever he should know her, and\nbattling with a myriad of black phantoms that seemed to rustle in his\ncurtains.'But you, M. de Chevalier,' he said apologetically to the\ncorrespondent to whom he told these dismal things, 'you are a father,\nyou know the cruel dreams of a waking man; if you were not of the\nprofession I would not allow my pen to write you this jeremiad.'As De\nMaistre was accustomed to think himself happy if he got three hours'\nsound sleep in the night, these sombre and terrible vigils were ample\nenough to excuse him if he had allowed them to overshadow all other\nthings.But the vigour of his intellect was too strenuous, and his\ncuriosity and interest in every object of knowledge too\ninextinguishable.'After all,' he said, 'the only thing to do is to put\non a good face, and to march to the place of torture with a few friends\nto console you on the way.This is the charming image under which I\npicture my present situation.Mark you,' he added, 'I always count books\namong one's consoling friends.'In one of the most gay and charming of his letters, apologising to a\nlady for the remissness of his correspondence, he explains that\ndiplomacy and books occupy every moment.'You will admit, madam, there\nis no possibility of one's shutting up books entirely.Nay, more than\never, I feel myself burning with the feverish thirst for knowledge.I\nhave had an access of it which I cannot describe to you.The most\ncurious books literally run after me, and hurry voluntarily to place\nthemselves in my hands.As soon as diplomacy gives me a moment of\nbreathing-time I rush headlong to that favourite pasture, to that\nambrosia of which the mind can never have enough--\n\n    _Et voila ce qui fait que votre ami est muet._'\n\nHe thinks himself happy if, by refusing invitations to dinner, he can\npass a whole day without stirring from his house.'I read, I write, I\nstudy; for after all one must know something.'In his hours of\ndepression he fancied that he only read and worked, not for the sake of\nthe knowledge, but to stupefy and tire himself out, if that were\npossible.As a student De Maistre was indefatigable.He never belonged to that\nlanguid band who hoped to learn difficult things by easy methods.The\nonly way, he warned his son, is to shut your door, to say that you are\nnot within, and to work.'Since they have set themselves to teach us how\nwe ought to learn the dead languages, you can find nobody who knows\nthem; and it is amusing enough that people who don't know them, should\nbe so obstinately bent on demonstrating the vices of the methods\nemployed by us who do know them.'He was one of those wise and laborious\nstudents who do not read without a pen in their hands.He never shrank\nfrom the useful toil of transcribing abundantly from all the books he\nread everything that could by any possibility eventually be of service\nto him in his inquiries.As soon as one of\nthem was filled, he carefully made up an index of its contents, numbered\nit, and placed it on a shelf with its unforgotten predecessors.In one\nplace he accidentally mentions that he had some thirty of these folios\nover the head of his writing-table.'If I am a pedant at home,' he said, 'at least I am as little as\npossible a pedant out of doors.'In the evening he would occasionally\nseek the society of ladies, by way of recovering some of that native\ngaiety of heart which had hitherto kept him alive.'I blow on this\nspark,' to use his own words, 'just as an old woman blows among the\nashes to get a light for her lamp.'A student and a thinker, De Maistre\nwas also a man of the world, and he may be added to the long list of\nwriters who have shown that to take an active part in public affairs and\nmix in society give a peculiar life, reality, and force to both\nscholarship and speculation.It was computed at that time that the\nauthor of a philosophic piece could not safely count upon more than a\nhundred and fifty readers in Russia; and hence, we might be sure, even\nif we had not De Maistre's word for it, that away from his own house he\nleft his philosophy behind.The vehemence of his own convictions did not\nprevent him from being socially tolerant to others who hated them.'If I\nhad the good fortune to be among his acquaintances,' he wrote of a\nheretical assailant, 'he would see that among the people with\nconvictions it would be hard to find one so free from prejudice as I am.I have many friends among the Protestants, and now that their system is\ntottering, they are all the dearer to me.'In spite of his scanty means,\nhis shabby valet, his threadbare cloak, and the humbleness of his\ndiplomatic position, the fire and honesty of his character combined with\nhis known ability to place him high in the esteem of the society of St.His fidelity, devotion, and fortitude, mellowed by many\nyears and by meditative habits, and tinged perhaps by the patrician\nconsciousness of birth, formed in him a modest dignity of manner which\nmen respected.They perceived it to be no artificial assumption, but the\noutward image of a lofty and self-respecting spirit.His brother\ndiplomatists, even the representatives of France, appear to have treated\nhim with marked consideration.His letters prove him to have been a\nfavourite among ladies.The Emperor Alexander showed him considerable\nkindness of the cheap royal sort.He conferred on his brother, Xavier de\nMaistre, a post in one of the public museums, while to the Sardinian\nenvoy's son he gave a commission in the Russian service.The first departure of this son for the campaign of 1807 occasioned some\nof the most charming passages in De Maistre's letters, both to the young\nsoldier himself and to others.For though without a touch of morbid\nexpansiveness, he never denied himself the solace of opening his heart\nto a trusted friend, and a just reserve with strangers did not hinder a\nhumane and manly confidence with intimates.'This morning,' he wrote to\nhis stripling, soon after he had joined the army, 'I felt a tightening\nat my heart when a pet dog came running in and jumped upon your bed,\nwhere he finds you no more.He soon perceived his mistake, and said\nclearly enough, after his own fashion: _I am mistaken; where can he be\nthen?_ As for me I have felt all that you will feel, if ever you pursue\nthis mighty trade of being a father.'And then he begs of his son if he\nshould find himself with a tape line in his hand, that he will take his\nexact measure and forward it.Soon came the news of the battle of\nFriedland, and the unhappy father thought he read the fate of his son in\nthe face of every acquaintance he met.And so it was in later campaigns,\nas De Maistre records in correspondence that glows with tender and\nhealthy solicitude.All this is worth dwelling upon, for two reasons.First, because De Maistre has been too much regarded and spoken of as a\nman of cold sensibility, and little moved by the hardships which fill\nthe destiny of our unfortunate race.And, secondly, because his own keen\nacquaintance with mental anguish helps us to understand the zeal with\nwhich he attempts to reconcile the blind cruelty and pain and torture\nendured by mortals with the benignity and wisdom of the immortal.'After\nall,' he used to say, 'there are only two real evils--remorse and\ndisease.'This is true enough for an apophthegm, but as a matter of fact\nit never for an instant dulled his sensibility to far less supreme forms\nof agony than the recollection of irreparable pain struck into the lives\nof others.It is interesting and suggestive to recall how a later\npublicist viewed the ills that dwarf our little lives.'If I were asked\nto class human miseries,' said Tocqueville, 'I would do so in this\norder: first, Disease; second, Death; third, Doubt.'At a later date, he\naltered the order, and deliberately declared doubt to be the most\ninsupportable of all evils, worse than death itself.But Tocqueville was\nan aristocrat, as Guizot once told him, who accepted his defeat.He\nstood on the brink of the great torrent of democracy, and shivered.De\nMaistre was an aristocrat too, but he was incapable of knowing what\ndoubt or hesitation meant.He never dreamt that his cause was lost, and\nhe mocked and defied the Revolution to the end.We easily see how\nnatures of this sort, ardent, impetuous, unflinching, find themselves in\nthe triumphant paths that lead to remorse at their close, and how they\nthus", "question": "Where is Daniel?

Albert\nBlanc.It is not at all surprising that they upon whom the revolutionary deluge\ncame should have looked with indiscriminating horror and affright on all\nthe influences which in their view had united first to gather up, and\nthen to release the destructive flood.The eighteenth century to men\nlike De Maistre seemed an infamous parenthesis, mysteriously interposed\nbetween the glorious age of Bossuet and Fenelon, and that yet brighter\nera for faith and the Church which was still to come in the good time of\nDivine Providence.The philosophy of the last century, he says on more\nthan one occasion, will form one of the most shameful epochs of the\nhuman mind: it never praised even good men except for what was bad in\nthem.He looked upon the gods whom that century had worshipped as the\ndirect authors of the bloodshed and ruin in which their epoch had\nclosed.The memory of mild and humane philosophers was covered with the\nkind of black execration that prophets of old had hurled at Baal or\nMoloch; Locke and Hume, Voltaire and Rousseau, were habitually spoken of\nas very scourges of God.From this temper two consequences naturally\nflowed.In the first place, while it lasted there was no hope of an\nhonest philosophic discussion of the great questions which divide\nspeculative minds.Moderation and impartiality were virtues of almost\nsuperhuman difficulty for controversialists who had made up their minds\nthat it was their opponents who had erected the guillotine, confiscated\nthe sacred property of the church, slaughtered and banished her\nchildren, and filled the land with terror and confusion.It is hard amid\nthe smoking ruins of the homestead to do full justice to the theoretical\narguments of the supposed authors of the conflagration.Hence De\nMaistre, though, as has been already said, intimately acquainted with\nthe works of his foes in the letter, was prevented by the vehemence of\nhis antipathy to the effects which he attributed to them, from having\nany just critical estimate of their value and true spirit.'I do not\nknow one of these men,' he says of the philosophers of the eighteenth\ncentury, 'to whom the sacred title of honest man is quite suitable.'Their very names '_me dechirent la\nbouche_.'To admire Voltaire is the sign of a corrupt soul; and if\nanybody is drawn to the works of Voltaire, then be sure that God does\nnot love such an one.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.The divine anathema is written on the very face of\nthis arch-blasphemer; on his shameless brow, in the two extinct craters\nstill sparkling with sensuality and hate, in that frightful _rictus_\nrunning from ear to ear, in those lips tightened by cruel malice, like a\nspring ready to fly back and launch forth blasphemy and sarcasm; he\nplunges into the mud, rolls in it, drinks of it; he surrenders his\nimagination to the enthusiasm of hell, which lends him all its forces;\nParis crowned him, Sodom would have banished him.[3] Locke, again, did\nnot understand himself.His distinguishing characteristics are\nfeebleness and precipitancy of judgment.Vagueness and irresolution\nreign in his expressions as they do in his thoughts.He constantly\nexhibits that most decisive sign of mediocrity--he passes close by the\ngreatest questions without perceiving them.In the study of philosophy,\ncontempt for Locke is the beginning of knowledge.[4] Condillac was even\nmore vigilantly than anybody else on his guard against his own\nconscience.But Hume was perhaps the most dangerous and the most guilty\nof all those mournful writers who will for ever accuse the last century\nbefore posterity--the one who employed the most talent with the most\ncoolness to do most harm.[5] To Bacon De Maistre paid the compliment of\ncomposing a long refutation of his main ideas, in which Bacon's\nblindness, presumption, profanity, and scientific charlatanry are\ndenounced in vehement and almost coarse terms, and treated as the\nnatural outcome of a low morality.It has long been the inglorious speciality of the theological school to\ninsist in this way upon moral depravity as an antecedent condition of\nintellectual error.De Maistre in this respect was not unworthy of his\nfellows.He believed that his opponents were even worse citizens than\nthey were bad philosophers, and it was his horror of them in the former\ncapacity that made him so bitter and resentful against them in the\nlatter.He could think of no more fitting image for opinions that he did\nnot happen to believe than counterfeit money, 'which is struck in the\nfirst instance by great criminals, and is afterwards passed on by honest\nfolk who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they do.'A\nphilosopher of the highest class, we may be sure, does not permit\nhimself to be drawn down from the true object of his meditations by\nthese sinister emotions.But De Maistre belonged emphatically to minds\nof the second order, whose eagerness to find truth is never intense and\npure enough to raise them above perturbing antipathies to persons.His\nwhole attitude was fatal to his claim to be heard as a truth-seeker in\nany right sense of the term.He was not only persuaded of the general\njustice and inexpugnableness of the orthodox system, but he refused to\nbelieve that it was capable of being improved or supplemented by\nanything which a temperate and fair examination of other doctrines might\nperadventure be found to yield.With De Maistre there was no\nperadventure.Home, and in the afternoon\nto the office, and much pleased at night to see my house begin to be clean\nafter all the dirt.At noon went and\ndined with my Lord Crew, where very much made of by him and his lady.Then\nto the Theatre, \"The Alchymist,\"--[Comedy by Ben Jonson, first printed in\n1612.]<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.And that being done I met with\nlittle Luellin and Blirton, who took me to a friend's of theirs in\nLincoln's Inn fields, one Mr.Hodges, where we drank great store of\nRhenish wine and were very merry.So I went home, where I found my house\nnow very clean, which was great content to me.In the morning to church, and my wife not being well,\nI went with Sir W.

Le\nMoyne, quite unconscious of her presence, looked down into the valley.Wilson appeared on the wooden porch above the terrace, and stood, his\neyes searching the half light for her.If he came down to her, the man\nat the next table might turn, would see her--\n\nShe rose and went swiftly back toward the hotel.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.All the gayety was\ngone out of the evening for her, but she forced a lightness she did not\nfeel:--\n\n\"It is so dark and depressing out there--it makes me sad.\"\"Surely you do not want to dine in the house?\"The prospect of the glaring lights and soiled\nlinen of the dining-room jarred on his aesthetic sense.He wanted a\nsetting for himself, for the girl.But\nwhen, in the full light of the moon, he saw the purplish shadows under\nher eyes, he forgot his resentment.He leaned over and ran his and\ncaressingly along her bare forearm.\"Your wish is my law--to-night,\" he said softly.After all, the evening was a disappointment to him.The spontaneity had\ngone out of it, for some reason.The girl who had thrilled to his glance\nthose two mornings in his office, whose somber eyes had met his fire for\nfire, across the operating-room, was not playing up.She sat back in her\nchair, eating little, starting at every step.Her eyes, which by every\nrule of the game should have been gazing into his, were fixed on the\noilcloth-covered passage outside the door.\"I think, after all, you are frightened!\"\"A little danger adds to the zest of things.Then, with an effort: \"What does he say?\"\"Two things are wanted by the true man--danger and play.Therefore he\nseeketh woman as the most dangerous of toys.\"\"Women are dangerous only when you think of them as toys.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.When a man\nfinds that a woman can reason,--do anything but feel,--he regards her\nas a menace.But the reasoning woman is really less dangerous than the\nother sort.\"To talk careful abstractions like\nthis, with beneath each abstraction its concealed personal application,\nto talk of woman and look in her eyes, to discuss new philosophies with\ntheir freedoms, to discard old creeds and old moralities--that was\nhis game.She challenged his philosophy and gave him a chance to\ndefend it.With the conviction, as their meal went on, that Le Moyne and\nhis companion must surely have gone, she gained ease.It was only by wild driving that she got back to the hospital by ten\no'clock.Wilson left her at the corner, well content with himself.He had had the\nrest he needed in congenial company.Even if she talked, there was nothing to tell.But\nhe felt confident that she would not talk.As he drove up the Street, he glanced across at the Page house.Sidney\nwas there on the doorstep, talking to a tall man who stood below and\nlooked up at her.He was sorry he had\nnot kissed Carlotta good-night.He rather thought, now he looked back,\nshe had expected it.As he got out of his car at the curb, a young man who had been standing\nin the shadow of the tree-box moved quickly away.CHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSidney entered the hospital as a probationer early in August.Christine\nwas to be married in September to Palmer Howe, and, with Harriet and K.\nin the house, she felt that she could safely leave her mother.The balcony outside the parlor was already under way.On the night\nbefore she went away, Sidney took chairs out there and sat with her\nmother until the dew drove Anna to the lamp in the sewing-room and her\n\"Daily Thoughts\" reading.Sidney sat alone and viewed her world from this new and pleasant\nangle.She could see the garden and the whitewashed fence with its\nmorning-glories, and at the same time, by turning her head, view the\nWilson house across the Street.K. Le Moyne was upstairs in his room.She could hear him tramping up and\ndown, and catch, occasionally, the bitter-sweet odor of his old brier\npipe.All the small loose ends of her life were gathered up--except Joe.She\nwould have liked to get that clear, too.She wanted him to know how she\nfelt about it all: that she liked him as much as ever, that she did not\nwant to hurt him.But she wanted to make it clear, too, that she knew\nnow that she would never marry him.She thought she would never marry;\nbut, if she did, it would be a man doing a man's work in the world.Her\neyes turned wistfully to the house across the Street.'s lamp still burned overhead, but his restless tramping about had\nceased.He must be reading--he read a great deal.A neighborhood cat came stealthily across the Street, and stared\nup at the little balcony with green-glowing eyes.\"Come on, Bill Taft,\" she said.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.\"Reginald is gone, so you are welcome.Joe Drummond, passing the house for the fourth time that evening, heard\nher voice, and hesitated uncertainly on the pavement.\"It's late; I'd better get home.\"\"You're not very kind to me, Joe.\"Isn't the kindest thing I can do\nto keep out of your way?\"\"Not if you are hating me all the time.\"\"Then why haven't you been to see me?If I have done anything--\" Her\nvoice was a-tingle with virtue and outraged friendship.\"You haven't done anything but--show me where I get off.\"He sat down on the edge of the balcony and stared out blankly.\"If that's the way you feel about it--\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming you.I was a fool to think you'd ever care about me.I\ndon't know that I feel so bad--about the thing.I've been around seeing\nsome other girls, and I notice they're glad to see me, and treat me\nright, too.\"There was boyish bravado in his voice.\"But what makes me\nsick is to have everyone saying you've jilted me.\"\"Well, we look at it in different ways; that's all.Then suddenly all his carefully conserved indifference fled.He bent\nforward quickly and, catching her hand, held it against his lips.The cat, finding no active antagonism, sprang up on the balcony and\nrubbed against the boy's quivering shoulders; a breath of air stroked\nthe morning-glory vine like the touch of a friendly hand.Sidney,\nfacing for the first time the enigma of love and despair sat, rather\nfrightened, in her chair.If it wasn't for the folks, I'd jump in the\nriver.I lied when I said I'd been to see other girls.\"No girl's worth what I've been going through,\" he retorted bitterly.I don't eat; I don't sleep--I'm afraid\nsometimes of the way I feel.When I saw you at the White Springs with\nthat roomer chap--\"\n\n\"Ah!\"If I'd had a gun I'd have killed him.I thought--\" So far, out of sheer\npity, she had left her hand in his.But he made a clutch at his self-respect.He was acting like a crazy\nboy, and he was a man, all of twenty-two!\"You'll be\nseeing him every day, I suppose.\"I shall also be seeing twenty or thirty other doctors, and\na hundred or so men patients, not to mention visitors.\"No,\" he said heavily, \"I'm not.If it's got to be someone, Sidney, I'd\nrather have it the roomer upstairs than Wilson.There's a lot of talk\nabout Wilson.\"\"I thought perhaps, since you are going away, you would let me keep\nReginald.I set Reginald free that day in the\ncountry.You'll come to see me now and then, won't you?\"\"If I do, do you think you may change your mind?\"\"I've got to fight this out alone, and the less I see of you the\nbetter.\"If I see him playing any of his tricks around\nyou--well, he'd better look out!\"That, as it turned out, was Joe's farewell.He gave her a long look, blinked, and walked rapidly out\nto the Street.Some of the dignity of his retreat was lost by the fact\nthat the cat followed him, close at his heels.If this was love, she did not want\nit--this strange compound of suspicion and despair, injured pride and\nthreats.Lovers in fiction were of two classes--the accepted ones, who\nloved and trusted, and the rejected ones, who took themselves away in\ndespair, but at least took themselves away.The thought of a future\nwith Joe always around a corner, watching her, obsessed her.She even shed a tear or two, very surreptitiously;\nand then, being human and much upset, and the cat startling her by its\nsudden return and selfish advances, she shooed it off the veranda and\nset an imaginary dog after it.Whereupon, feeling somewhat better, she\nwent in and locked the balcony window and proceeded upstairs.There was a movement inside, the sound of a book put down.From the sounds, she judged that he was putting on his shabby gray\ncoat.The next moment he had opened the door and stepped out into the\ncorridor.I started downstairs a while ago, but you had a\nvisitor.\"He gazed down at her quizzically.He knows now that I--that I shall not marry him.\"\"I believe you think I should have married him.\"\"I am only putting myself in his place and realizing--When do you\nleave?\"Then, hurriedly:--\n\n\"I got a little present for you--nothing much, but your mother was quite\nwilling.He went back into his room, and returned with a small box.\"With all sorts of good luck,\" he said, and placed it in her hands.Because, if you would rather have something else--\"\n\nShe opened the box with excited fingers.Ticking away on its satin bed\nwas a small gold watch.\"You'll need it, you see,\" he explained nervously, \"It wasn't\nextravagant under the circumstances.Your mother's watch, which you had\nintended to take, had no second-hand.You'll need a second-hand to take\npulses, you know.\"\"A watch,\" said Sidney, eyes on it.\"A dear little watch, to pin on and\nnot put in a pocket.\"I was afraid you might think it presumptuous,\" he said.\"I haven't any\nright, of course.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.I thought of flowers--but they fade and what have you?You said that, you know, about Joe's roses.And then, your mother said\nyou wouldn't be offended--\"\n\n\"Don't apologize for making me so happy!\"After that she must pin it on, and slip in to stand before his mirror\nand inspect the result.It gave Le Moyne a queer thrill to see her there\nin the room among his books and his pipes.It make him a little sick,\ntoo, in view of to-morrow and the thousand-odd to-morrows when she would\nnot be there.\"I've kept you up shamefully,'\" she said at last, \"and you get up so\nearly.I shall write you a note from the hospital, delivering a little\nlecture on extravagance--because how can I now, with this joy shining on\nme?<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.And about how to keep Katie in order about your socks, and all sorts\nof things.She had moved to the door, and he followed her, stooping a little to\npass under the low chandelier.\"Good-bye--and God bless you.\"She went out, and he closed the door softly behind her.CHAPTER IX\n\n\nSidney never forgot her early impressions of the hospital, although they\nwere chaotic enough", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "There were uniformed young women\ncoming and going, efficient, cool-eyed, low of voice.There were\nmedicine-closets with orderly rows of labeled bottles, linen-rooms with\ngreat stacks of sheets and towels, long vistas of shining floors and\nlines of beds.There were brisk internes with duck clothes and brass\nbuttons, who eyed her with friendly, patronizing glances.There were\nbandages and dressings, and great white screens behind which were played\nlittle or big dramas, baths or deaths, as the case might be.And over\nall brooded the mysterious authority of the superintendent of the\ntraining-school, dubbed the Head, for short.Twelve hours a day, from seven to seven, with the off-duty intermission,\nSidney labored at tasks which revolted her soul.She swept and\ndusted the wards, cleaned closets, folded sheets and towels, rolled\nbandages--did everything but nurse the sick, which was what she had come\nto do.She sat on the edge of her narrow white\nbed and soaked her aching feet in hot water and witch hazel, and\npracticed taking pulses on her own slender wrist, with K.Out of all the long, hot days, two periods stood out clearly, to be\nwaited for and cherished.One was when, early in the afternoon, with\nthe ward in spotless order, the shades drawn against the August sun, the\ntables covered with their red covers, and the only sound the drone of\nthe bandage-machine as Sidney steadily turned it, Dr.Max passed the\ndoor on his way to the surgical ward beyond, and gave her a cheery\ngreeting.At these times Sidney's heart beat almost in time with the\nticking of the little watch.The other hour was at twilight, when, work over for the day, the night\nnurse, with her rubber-soled shoes and tired eyes and jangling keys,\nhaving reported and received the night orders, the nurses gathered in\ntheir small parlor for prayers.It was months before Sidney got over the\nexaltation of that twilight hour, and never did it cease to bring her\nhealing and peace.In a way, it crystallized for her what the day's work\nmeant: charity and its sister, service, the promise of rest and peace.Into the little parlor filed the nurses, and knelt, folding their tired\nhands.\"The Lord is my shepherd,\" read the Head out of her worn Bible; \"I shall\nnot want.\"And the nurses: \"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth\nme beside the still waters.\"And so on through the psalm to the assurance at the end, \"And I will\ndwell in the house of the Lord forever.\"Now and then there was a death\nbehind one of the white screens.It caused little change in the routine\nof the ward.A nurse stayed behind the screen, and her work was done by\nthe others.When everything was over, the time was recorded exactly on\nthe record, and the body was taken away.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.At first it seemed to Sidney that she could not stand this nearness to\ndeath.She thought the nurses hard because they took it quietly.Then\nshe found that it was only stoicism, resignation, that they had learned.These things must be, and the work must go on.Some such patient detachment must be that of the\nangels who keep the Great Record.On her first Sunday half-holiday she was free in the morning, and went\nto church with her mother, going back to the hospital after the service.So it was two weeks before she saw Le Moyne again.Even then, it was\nonly for a short time.Christine and Palmer Howe came in to see her, and\nto inspect the balcony, now finished.But Sidney and Le Moyne had a few words together first.She was\na trifle subdued, with a puzzled look in her blue eyes.Her mouth was\ntender, as always, but he thought it drooped.There was a new atmosphere\nof wistfulness about the girl that made his heart ache.They were alone in the little parlor with its brown lamp and blue silk\nshade, and its small nude Eve--which Anna kept because it had been a\ngift from her husband, but retired behind a photograph of the minister,\nso that only the head and a bare arm holding the apple appeared above\nthe reverend gentleman.K. never smoked in the parlor, but by sheer force of habit he held the\npipe in his teeth.Aunt Harriet, who left you her love,\nhas had the complete order for the Lorenz trousseau.She and I have\npicked out a stunning design for the wedding dress.I thought I'd ask\nyou about the veil.Do you like this new\nfashion of draping the veil from behind the coiffure in the back--\"\n\nSidney had been sitting on the edge of her chair, staring.\"There,\" she said--\"I knew it!They're making an\nold woman of you already.\"\"Miss Lorenz likes the new method, but my personal preference is for the\nold way, with the bride's face covered.\"\"Katie has a new prescription--recipe--for bread.It has more bread and\nfewer air-holes.One cake of yeast--\"\n\nSidney sprang to her feet.\"Because you rent a room in\nthis house is no reason why you should give up your personality and\nyour--intelligence.But Katie has\nmade bread without masculine assistance for a good many years, and if\nChristine can't decide about her own veil she'd better not get married.Mother says you water the flowers every evening, and lock up the house\nbefore you go to bed.I--I never meant you to adopt the family!\"K. removed his pipe and gazed earnestly into the bowl.\"Bill Taft has had kittens under the porch,\" he said.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.\"And the\ngroceryman has been sending short weight.We've bought scales now, and\nweigh everything.\"\"Dear child, I am doing these things because I like to do them.For--for\nsome time I've been floating, and now I've got a home.Every time I\nlock up the windows at night, or cut a picture out of a magazine as a\nsuggestion to your Aunt Harriet, it's an anchor to windward.\"Sidney gazed helplessly at his imperturbable face.He seemed older than\nshe had recalled him: the hair over his ears was almost white.That was Palmer Howe's age, and Palmer seemed like a\nboy.But he held himself more erect than he had in the first days of his\noccupancy of the second-floor front.\"And now,\" he said cheerfully, \"what about yourself?You've lost a lot\nof illusions, of course, but perhaps you've gained ideals.\"Life,\" observed Sidney, with the wisdom of two weeks out in the world,\n\"life is a terrible thing, K. We think we've got it, and--it's got us.\"\"When I think of how simple I used to think it all was!One grew up and\ngot married, and--and perhaps had children.And when one got very\nold, one died.Lately, I've been seeing that life really consists of\nexceptions--children who don't grow up, and grown-ups who die before\nthey are old.And\"--this took an effort, but she looked at him\nsquarely--\"and people who have children, but are not married.\"All knowledge that is worth while hurts in the getting.\"Sidney got up and wandered around the room, touching its little familiar\nobjects with tender hands.There was this curious\nelement in his love for her, that when he was with her it took on the\nguise of friendship and deceived even himself.It was only in the lonely\nhours that it took on truth, became a hopeless yearning for the touch of\nher hand or a glance from her clear eyes.Sidney, having picked up the minister's picture, replaced it absently,\nso that Eve stood revealed in all her pre-apple innocence.\"There is something else,\" she said absently.There is a girl in the ward--\"\n\n\"A patient?\"She has had typhoid, but she is a little\nbetter.\"At first I couldn't bear to go near her.I shivered when I had to\nstraighten her bed.I--I'm being very frank, but I've got to talk this\nout with someone.I worried a lot about it, because, although at first I\nhated her, now I don't.She looked at K. defiantly, but there was no disapproval in his eyes.She'll be able to\ngo out soon.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Don't you think something ought to be done to keep her\nfrom--going back?\"She was so young to face all this;\nand yet, since face it she must, how much better to have her do it\nsquarely.\"Does she want to change her mode of life?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.She\ncares a great deal for some man.The other day I propped her up in bed\nand gave her a newspaper, and after a while I found the paper on the\nfloor, and she was crying.The other patients avoid her, and it was\nsome time before I noticed it.The next day she told me that the man\nwas going to marry some one else.'He wouldn't marry me, of course,' she\nsaid; 'but he might have told me.'\"Le Moyne did his best, that afternoon in the little parlor, to provide\nSidney with a philosophy to carry her through her training.He told her\nthat certain responsibilities were hers, but that she could not reform\nthe world.Broad charity, tenderness, and healing were her province.\"Help them all you can,\" he finished, feeling inadequate and hopelessly\ndidactic.\"Cure them; send them out with a smile; and--leave the rest to\nthe Almighty.\"Newly facing the evil of the\nworld, she was a rampant reformer at once.Only the arrival of Christine\nand her fiance saved his philosophy from complete rout.He had time for\na question between the ring of the bell and Katie's deliberate progress\nfrom the kitchen to the front door.He stops at the door of the ward and speaks to me.It\nmakes me quite distinguished, for a probationer.Usually, you know, the\nstaff never even see the probationers.\"\"I think he is very wonderful,\" said Sidney valiantly.Christine Lorenz, while not large, seemed to fill the little room.Her\nvoice, which was frequent and penetrating, her smile, which was wide\nand showed very white teeth that were a trifle large for beauty, her\nall-embracing good nature, dominated the entire lower floor.K., who had\nmet her before, retired into silence and a corner.Young Howe smoked a\ncigarette in the hall.said Christine, and put her cheek against Sidney's.Palmer gives you a month to tire of it\nall; but I said--\"\n\n\"I take that back,\" Palmer spoke indolently from the corridor.\"There\nis the look of willing martyrdom in her face.I've\nbrought some nuts for him.\"\"Reginald is back in the woods again.\"\"Now, look here,\" he said solemnly.\"When we arranged about these rooms,\nthere were certain properties that went with them--the lady next door\nwho plays Paderewski's 'Minuet' six hours a day, and K. here, and\nReginald.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.If you must take something to the woods, why not the minuet\nperson?\"Howe was a good-looking man, thin, smooth-shaven, aggressively well\ndressed.This Sunday afternoon, in a cutaway coat and high hat, with\nan English malacca stick, he was just a little out of the picture.The\nStreet said that he was \"wild,\" and that to get into the Country Club\nset Christine was losing more than she was gaining.Christine had stepped out on the balcony, and was speaking to K. just\ninside.\"It's rather a queer way to live, of course,\" she said.\"But Palmer is a\npauper, practically.We are going to take our meals at home for a while.You see, certain things that we want we can't have if we take a house--a\ncar, for instance.We'll need one for running out to the Country Club to\ndinner.Of course, unless father gives me one for a wedding present, it\nwill be a cheap one.And we're getting the Rosenfeld boy to drive it.He's crazy about machinery, and he'll come for practically nothing.\"K. had never known a married couple to take two rooms and go to the\nbride's mother's for meals in order to keep a car.Also, certain sophistries of his former world about a cheap\nchauffeur being costly in the end rose in his mind and were carefully\nsuppressed.\"You'll find a car a great comfort, I'm sure,\" he said politely.She liked his graying hair\nand steady eyes, and insisted on considering his shabbiness a pose.She\nwas conscious that she made a pretty picture in the French window, and\npreened herself like a bright bird.\"You'll come out with us now and then, I hope.\"\"Isn't it odd to think that we are going to be practically one family!\"He caught the flash of Christine's smile, and smiled back.Christine was\nglad she had decided to take the rooms, glad that K. lived there.This\nthing of marriage being the end of all things was absurd.A married\nwoman should have men friends; they kept her up.She would take him to\nthe Country Club.Across the Street, the Rosenfeld boy had stopped by Dr.Wilson's car,\nand was eyeing it with the cool, appraising glance of the street\nboy whose sole knowledge of machinery has been acquired from the\nclothes-washer at home.Joe Drummond, eyes carefully ahead, went up the\nStreet.McKee's, stood in the doorway and fanned herself\nwith her apron.Max Wilson came out of the house and got into his car.For a minute, perhaps, all the actors, save Carlotta and Dr.It was that bete noir of the playwright, an ensemble;

Le\nMoyne and Sidney, Palmer Howe, Christine, Tillie, the younger Wilson,\nJoe, even young Rosenfeld, all within speaking distance, almost touching\ndistance, gathered within and about the little house on a side street\nwhich K. at first grimly and now tenderly called \"home.\"CHAPTER X\n\n\nOn Monday morning, shortly after the McKee prolonged breakfast was over,\na small man of perhaps fifty, with iron-gray hair and a sparse goatee,\nmade his way along the Street.He moved with the air of one having a\ndefinite destination but a by no means definite reception.As he walked along he eyed with a professional glance the ailanthus and\nmaple trees which, with an occasional poplar, lined the Street.Owing to a slight change\nin the grade of the street, the McKee house had no stoop, but one flat\ndoorstep.Thus it was possible to ring the doorbell from the pavement,\nand this the stranger did.It gave him a curious appearance of being\nready to cut and run if things were unfavorable.She recognized him at once, but no smile met the nervous one\nthat formed itself on the stranger's face.\"I was thinking, as I came along,\" he said, \"that you and the neighbors\nhad better get after these here caterpillars.\"If you want to see Tillie, she's busy.\"\"I only want to say how-d 'ye-do.A certain doggedness took the place of his tentative smile.\"I'll say it to myself, I guess.I don't want any unpleasantness, but\nI've come a good ways to see her and I'll hang around until I do.\"McKee knew herself routed, and retreated to the kitchen.Only, my advice to you is, don't be a fool.\"The hands with which she tied a white apron\nover her gingham one were shaking.Her visitor had accepted the open door as permission to enter and was\nstanding in the hall.He went rather white himself when he saw Tillie coming toward him down\nthe hall.The boys had\nbecome quite attached to Mortimer Blaze and listened eagerly to\nthe many hunting tales he had to tell.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.\"I wish you were going with us,\" said Tom to him.\"I like your\nstyle, as you Englishman put it.\"\"Thanks, Rover, and I must say I cotton to you, as the Americans\nput it,\" laughed the hunter.\"Well, perhaps we'll meet in the\ninterior, who knows?\"I am hoping to meet some friends at Boma.The steamer bad now struck the equator, and as it was midsummer\nthe weather was extremely warm, and the smell of the oozing tar,\npouring from every joint, was sickening.\"I could sleep eall de time,", "question": "Where is Sandra?

fellow doesn't want too much of it.\"\"And yet I heard one of the French sailors say that he hated the\nland,\" put in Sam.\"He hadn't set foot on shore for three years.When they reach port he always remains on deck duty until they\nleave again.\"Mortimer Blaze went ashore at once, after bidding all of the party\na hearty good-by.\"Hope you bag all of the lions\nand tigers you wish,\" and so they parted, not to meet again for\nmany a day.It was decided that the Rovers should not leave the ship until\nmorning.It can well be imagined that none of the boys slept\nsoundly that night.All wondered what was before them, and if\nthey should succeed or fail in their hunt.\"Dis aint much ob a town,\" remarked Aleck, as they landed, a\nlittle before noon, in a hot, gentle shower of rain.\"There is only one New York, as there is but one London,\" answered\nRandolph Rover.\"Our architecture would never do for such a hot\nclimate.\"Along the river front was a long line of squatty warehouses,\nbacked up by narrow and far from clean streets, where the places\nof business were huddled together, and where a good share of the\ntrading was done on the sidewalk.The population was a very much\nmixed one, but of the Europeans the English and French\npredominated.The natives were short, fat, and exceedingly greasy\nappearing.Hardly a one of them could speak English.\"I don't see any Americans,\" remarked Dick.\"I suppose--\"\n\n\"There is an American store!\"burst out Sam, pointing across the\nway.He had discovered a general trading store, the dilapidated\nsign of which read:\n\n          SIMON HOOK,\n\n       Dealer in Everything.\"I'd like to go in\nand see Simon Hook.Rover was willing, and they entered the low and dingy-looking\nestablishment, which was filled with boxes, barrels, and bags of\ngoods.They found the proprietor sitting in an easy chair, his feet on a\ndesk, and a pipe in his mouth.\"That's me,\" was the answer; but Mr.Hook did not offer to rise,\nnor indeed to even shift his position.\"We saw your sign and as we are Americans we thought we would drop\nin,\" went on Mr.\"That's right; glad to see you,\" came from the man in the chair;\nbut still he did not offer to shift his position.\"It's a fool's place to come to, sonny.When these goods are sold\nI'm going to quit.\"Simon Hook paused long enough to take an\nextra whiff from his pipe.\"We are on a hunt for a missing man,\" answered Randolph Rover.His name is Anderson Rover, and he is my\nbrother.\"He was a gold hunter from Californy, or somethin' like that.\"\"Went up the Congo four or five years ago--maybe longer?\"He had lots of money, and took several guides\nand a number of other, natives along.\"\"Have you seen or heard of him since?\"\"Because them as goes up the Congo never, comes back.It's a\nfool's trip among those wild people of the interior.Stanley went\nup, but look at the big party he took with him and the many fights\nhe had to get back alive.\"At this announcement the hearts of the Rover boys fell.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.I reckon he's either lost in the jungle or\namong the mountains, or else the natives have taken care of him.\"\"Did he say anything about the trail he was going to take?\"\"He was going to take the Rumbobo trail, most all of 'em do.\"\"Say, can I sell you any of these\nold things of mine cheap?\"\"Glad to see you,\" and as they left the shopkeeper waved them a\npleasant adieu with his hand.\"I guess he has grown tired of trying to sell goods,\" observed\nTom.\"Perhaps he knows that if folks want the things he has to sell\nthey are bound to come to him,\" said Dick.\"His store seems to\nbe the only one of its sort around.\"The hotel for which they were bound was several squares away,\nlocated in something of a park, with pretty flowers and a\nfountain.It was a two-story affair, with spacious verandas and\nlarge rooms, and frequented mostly by English and French people.They had just entered the office; and Randolph Rover was writing\nhis name in the register, when Dick caught sight of somebody in\nthe reading room that nearly took away his breath.It is Dan Baxter--Dan\nBaxter, just as sure as you are born!\"CHAPTER XV\n\nCAPTAIN VILLAIRE'S LITTLE PLOT\n\n\nDick was right: the boy in the reading-room' was indeed Dan Baxter,\nbut so changed in appearance that for the minute neither Tom nor\nSam recognized him.In the past Baxter had always been used to fine clothing, which he\nhad taken care should be in good repair.Now his clothing was\ndilapidated and his shoes looked as if they were about ready to\nfall apart.More than this, his face was hollow and careworn, and one eye\nlooked as if it had suffered severe blow of some sort.Altogether\nhe was most wretched-looking specimen of humanity, and it was a\nwonder that he was allowed at the hotel.But the truth of the\nmatter was that he had told the proprietor a long tale of\nsufferings in the interior and of a delayed remittance from home,\nand the hotel keeper was keeping him solely on this account.\"He's been in hard luck, that's certain,\" came from Sam.\"I\nwonder how he drifted out here?\"While Sam was speaking Dan Baxter raised his eyes from the\nnewspaper and glanced around.As his gaze fell upon the three\nRover boys he started and the paper fell to the floor, then he got\nup and strode toward them.\"From Putnam Hall, Baxter,\" answered Dick quietly.Ordinarily Dan Baxter would have retorted that that was none of\nDick's business, but now he was in thoroughly low spirits, and he\nanswered meekly:\n\n\"I've been playing in hard luck.I went down to New York and one\nnight when I was in a sailors' boarding house I drank more than\nwas good for me, and when I woke up in the morning I found myself\non a vessel bound for Africa.\"\"You were shanghaied as a sailor?\"\"That's it, and while I was on board the Costelk the captain and\nmate treated me worse than a dog.The captain did\nthat, and when I struck back he put me in irons and fed me nothing\nbut stale biscuits and water.\"\"No; she was bound for Cape Town, but stopped here for supplies,\nand I jumped overboard at night and swam ashore, and here I am,\nand sorry for it,\" and Dan Baxter drew a long breath.The Rovers were astonished at his meek manner.Was this really\nthe domineering Baxter, who had always insisted on having his own\nway, and who had done so many wrong deeds in the past?\"You've had a hard time of it, I suppose?said Dick, hardly\nknowing how to go on.\"Hard, Dick, aint no word,\" came from the former bully of Putnam\nHall.\"I've run up against the worst luck that anybody could ever\nimagine.But I reckon you don't care about that?\"\"Do you think we ought to care, Baxter?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.\"Well, it aint fair to take advantage of a chap when he's down on\nhis luck,\" grumbled the former bully.\"I guess I've learnt my\nlesson all right enough.\"\"Do you mean to say you are going to turn over a new leaf?\"Randolph Rover now joined the group, and Dick explained the\nsituation.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Rover questioned Baxter closely and found that he\nwas without a cent in his pocket and that the hotel keeper had\nthreatened to put him out if he was not able to pay up inside of\nthe next twenty-four hours.\"See here, Baxter, you never were my friend, and you never\ndeserved any good from me, but I don't like to see a dog suffer,\"\nsaid Dick.\"I'll give you thirty shillings, and that will help\nyou along a little,\" and he drew out his purse.\"And I'll give you the same,\" came from Tom.\"But don't forget that what Dick says\nis true, nevertheless.\"Ninety English shillings--about twenty-two dollars of our money--was\nmore cash than Dan Baxter had seen in some time, his other\nmoney having been spent before he had taken his unexpected ocean\ntrip, and his eyes brightened up wonderfully.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.\"I'll be much obliged to you for the--the loan,\" he stammered.\"I'll pay you back some time, remember.\"\"My advice to you is, to take the first ship you can for home.\"\"And what brought you out here--going on a hunt for your\nfather?\"I understand the natives of\nthe Congo are going on the warpath before long.They have had\nsome difficulty with the settlers.\"\"I guess we'll manage to take care of ourselves,\" answered Tom,\nand then he and his brothers followed their uncle up to the rooms\nwhich had been engaged for them during their stay in the town.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.\"He's, down in the mouth, and no mistake,\" was Tom's comment, when\nthe boys were left to themselves.\"Perhaps knocking around has taught him a lesson,\" said Dick.\"I\nhope he really does turn over a new leaf.\"Randolph Rover gathered all the\ninformation he could concerning the trail along the Congo, and\nalso tried to locate Niwili Camp.He likewise purchased several\nadditions to his outfits from Simon Hook, and engaged the services\nof several natives, the leader of whom was a brawny black named\nCujo, a fellow who declared that he knew every foot of the\nterritory to be covered and who said he was certain that he could\nlocate King Susko sooner or later.\"Him bad man,\" he said soberly.\"No et him catch you, or you\nsuffer big lot!\"Cujo took to Aleck from the start, and the pair\nsoon became warm friends.The African inspected their outfits\nwith interest and offered several suggestions regarding additional\npurchases.Three days were spent in Boma, and during that time the Rovers saw\na good deal of Dan Baxter, who, having nothing better to do, hung\naround them continually.He remained as meek as before, but our\nfriends did not know that this was merely the meekness of a savage\ncur while under the whip.Baxter was naturally a brute, and\nlacked the backbone necessary far genuine reformation.\"Say, why can't you take me with you?\"he asked, on the day that\nthe Rover expedition was to start out.\"I'm willing to do my\nshare of the work and the fighting, and I won't charge you a cent\nfor my service.\"\"I don't know as my uncle wants anybody along,\" said Sam, to whom\nBaxter addressed his remarks.\"Well, won't you speak to him about it, Sam?I can't find\nanything to do here, and the captains to whom I've applied don't\nwant me on their ships,\" pleaded the former bully of Putnam Hall.Sam was easily touched at all times, and he knew that Baxter must\nfeel lonely and wretched so far from home and without friends or\ncapital.He at once went to his brothers and his uncle and laid\nthe big youth's proposition before them.\"We don't want him,\" said Dick promptly.\"I don't believe he would be of any use to us.\"\"I would rather give him some more money just for him to stay\nbehind,\" added Tom.\"Well, I don't like Baxter any more than the others do.But it\nseems awfully hard on him.I don't believe he knows how to turn.\"\"We might give him enough money to get back to the United States\nwith.\"\"I'd rather have you do that, Uncle Randolph,\" said Dick.\"I will have a talk with the misguided boy,\" was the conclusion\nreached by Randolph Rover; but he got no chance to speak to Dan\nBaxter until late in the afternoon, and then, to his astonishment,\nBaxter's manner had changed entirely, he intimating that he wanted\nnothing more to do with them.For in the meantime something which was bound to be of great\nimportance to the Rovers had occurred.In Boma were a number of\npersons of mixed French and native blood who were little better\nthan the old-time brigands of Italy.They were led by a wicked\nwretch who went by the name of Captain Villaire.Villaire had\nbeen watching the Rovers for two days when he noticed the coldness\nwhich seemed to exist between, our friends and Baxter.At once he\nthrew himself in Baxter's way and began to it pump the youth\nregarding the Americans.\"Zay are going into the interior, you have remarked,\" he said in\nvery bad English.\"Yes, they are well fixed,\" answered the tall youth.\"And zay do carry zare money wid zem?\"\"I guess not--at least, not much of it.\"\"Yes, I hate them,\" muttered Dan, and his eyes shone wickedly.\"I'm only treating them in a friendly way now because I'm out of\nmoney and must do something.\"It ees a good head you have--verra good,\" murmured\nCaptain Villaire.\"Do you know, I heara dem talk about you?\"\"De one boy say you should be in ze jail; didn't you robba\nsomebody.\"\"You lika do somet'ing wid me?\"continued the French native,\nclosing one eye suggestively.He was a close reader of human\nnature and had read Baxter's character as if it was an open book.\"We gitta dem people into trouble--maka big lot of money.\"\"All right--I'll do anything,\" answered Baxter savagely.\"So\nthey said I ought to be in jail, eh?\"You helpa me, I helpa you,\" went on the wily French native.He had his plan all ready, and, after sounding Baxter some more,\nrevealed what was in his mind, which was simply to follow the\nRovers into the interior and then make them prisoners.Once this\nwas done, they would hold the prisoners for a handsome ransom.\"That's a big job,\" answered the big youth.\"But I like your\nplan, first-rate if you can carry it out.\"\"I have half a dozen of ze\nbest of killowers-za, nevair fail me.But as you knowa dem you\nwill have to do ze lettair writing for us, so zat we git ze money\nfrom zare people at home.\"\"Trust me for that,\" responded Baxter quickly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.\"You do the capturing and I'll make Mrs.Rover or\nsomebody else pay up handsomely, never fear.\"And so a compact was formed which was to give the Rovers a good\ndeal of trouble in the near future.CHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE START UP THE CONGO\n\n\n\"It was queer Dan Baxter should act so,\" said Sam to his uncle,\nwhen Mr.Rover came back from his interview with the bully.\"I\nthought he wanted to, go the worst way.\"\"He acted as if he had struck something else,\" answered Randolph\nRover.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.\"He didn't even want the money I offered.Perhaps he has\nreceived a remittance from home.\"\"His father is still in\njail.\"\"Perhaps he got Mumps to send it to him,\" said Sam.\"But I\nforgot, Mumps is away.\"There was no time to discuss the situation further, for they were\nto start early on the following morning, and there were yet a\ndozen small matters which must be given", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "All were busy,\nand it was not until after eleven that evening that they turned\nin.The day for the departure from Boma dawned bright and clear, and\nCujo appeared with his assistants while they were still eating\nbreakfast.\"Werry good day for um journey,\" he said, with a grin.\"Make good\nmany miles if nothing go wrong.\"\"You can't do any too well for me,\" answered Dick.\"I hope our\nexpedition into the interior is both short and successful.\"At first they had thought to go\non horseback; but this was abandoned by the advice of the native,\nwho declared that horses would prove more of a drag than a help in\nmany places.\"Horse canno' climb tree bridge,\" he explained.\"No climb high\nrock, no go around bad hill.We go on foot an' make better time.\"The town was soon left behind and they struck a highway which for\nseveral miles afforded easy traveling.On all sides were dense\ngroves of tropical growth, palms, mangoes, and the like, with\nenormous vines festooned from one tree to the next.Underneath\nwere a great variety, of ferns and mosses, the homes of countless\ninsects and small animals.The ground was black and wherever\nturned up gave forth a sickly odor of decayed vegetation.\"That is regular fever territory,\" explained Randolph Rover.\"Boys, do not sleep on the ground if you can possibly avoid it.I\nsincerely trust that none of us take the tropical fever.\"\"If I feel it coming on I'll take a good dose of quinine,\"\ndeclared Tom.Fortunately they had brought along a good supply of that valuable\ndrug.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.On one side\nof the highway was the broad river, which glinted like molten lead\nin the sunshine.They could not travel very close to its bank,\nfor here the ground was uncertain.Once Sam left the highway to\nget a better view of the stream, and, before Cujo noticed it,\nfound himself up to his knees in a muck which stuck to him like so\nmuch glue.roared the youngest Rover, and all of the party\nturned, to behold him waving his hand frantically toward them.exclaimed Aleck, and started to go\nto Sam's assistance, when Cujo called him back.\"Must be werry careful,\" said the native.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.\"Ground bad over\ndare--lose life if urn don't have a care.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.And he\napproached Sam by a circuitous route over the tufts of grass\nwhich grew like so many dots amid the swamp.Soon he was close\nenough to throw the youth the end of a rope he carried.The pull\nthat, followed nearly took Sam's arms out by the sockets; but the\nboy was saved, to return to the others of the party with an\nexperience which was destined to be very useful to him in, the\nfuture.\"It will teach me to be careful of where I am going after this,\"\nhe declared.\"Why, that bog looked almost as safe as the ground\nover here!\"\"Tropical places are all full of just such treacherous swamps,\"\nreturned Randolph Rover.\"It will be wise for all of us to\nremember that we are now in a strange territory and that we must\nhave our eyes and ears wide open.\"At half-past eleven they came to a halt for dinner.The sun was\nnow almost overhead, and they were glad enough to seek the shelter\nof a number of palms standing in front of a--native hostelry.\"We will rest here until two o'clock,\" said Mr.\"It is all\nout of the question to travel in the heat of the day, as we did\nyesterday, in such a climate as this.They found the hostelry presided over by a short, fat native who\nscarcely spoke a word of English.But he could speak French, and\nMr.Rover spoke to him in that language, while Cujo carried on a\ntalk in the native tongue.The midday repast was cooked over a\nfire built between several stones.The boys watched the cooking\nprocess with interest and were surprised to find, when it came to\neating, that the food prepared tasted so good.They had antelope\nsteak and a generous supply of native bread, and pure cocoa, which\nTom declared as good as chocolate.After the meal they took it easy in a number of grass hammocks\nstretched beneath the wide spreading palms surrounding the wayside\ninn, if such it might be called.Aleck and Cujo fell to smoking\nand telling each other stories, while the Rovers dozed away, lulled\nto sleep by the warm, gentle breeze which was blowing.\"I don't wonder the natives are lazy,\" remarked Dick, when his\nuncle aroused him.\"I rarely slept in the daytime at home, and\nhere I fell off without half trying.\"\"The climate is very enervating, Dick.That is why this section\nof the globe makes little or no progress toward civilization.Energetic men come here, with the best intention in the world of\nhustling, as it is termed, but soon their ambition oozes out of\nthem like--well, like molasses out of a barrel lying on a hot\ndock in the sun.he called out, and soon the party was on\nits way again.The highway was still broad, but now it was not as even as before,\nand here and there they had to leap over just such a treacherous\nswamp as had caused Sam so much trouble.\"It's a good thing we\ndidn't bring the horses,\" said Mr.\"I didn't think so\nbefore, but I do now.\"The jungle was filled with countless birds, of all sorts, sizes,\nand colors.Some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion, but\nthe majority uttered only sounds which were as painful to the\nhearing as they were tiresome.\"The sound is enough to drive a nervous fellow crazy,\" declared\nTom.\"It's a good thing nature fixed it so that a man can't grow\nup nervous here.\"\"Perhaps those outrageous cries are meant to wake a chap up,\"\nsuggested Dick.\"I've a good mind to shoot some of the little pests.\"\"You may take a few shots later on and see what you can bring down\nfor supper,\" answered his uncle.\"But just now let us push on as\nfast as we can.\"\"Remember we are out here to find father, not\nto hunt.\"\"As if I would ever forget that,\" answered Dick, with a\nreproachful glance.They were now traveling a bit of a hill which took them, temporarily,\nout of sight of the Congo.Cujo declared this was a short route\nand much better to travel than the other.The way was through a\nforest of African teak wood, immense trees which seemed to tower\nto the very skies.\"They are as large as the immense trees of California of which you\nhave all heard,\" remarked Randolph Rover.\"It is a very useful\nwood, used extensively in ship building.\"\"After all, I think a boat on the Congo would have been better to\nuse than shoe leather,\" said Sam, who was beginning to grow tired.\"No use a boat when come to falls,\" grinned Cujo.Aleck had been dragging behind, carrying a heavy load, to which\nhe was unaccustomed.Now he rejoined the others with the\nannouncement that another party was in their rear.\"They are on foot, too,\" he said.\"Cujo whar you dun t'ink da be\ngwine?\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.\"To the next settlement, maybe,\" was Randolph Rover's comment,\nand Cujo nodded.They waited a bit for the other party to come up, but it did not,\nand, after walking back, Cujo returned with the announcement that\nthey were nowhere in sight.\"Perhaps they turned off on a side road,\" said Tom, and there the\nmatter was dropped, to be brought to their notice very forcibly\nthat night.Evening found them at another hostelry, presided over by a\nFrenchman who had a giant negress for a wife.The pair were a\ncrafty looking couple, and did not at all please the Rovers.\"Perhaps we may as well sleep with one eye open tonight,\" said\nRandolph Rover, upon retiring.\"We are in a strange country, and\nit's good advice to consider every man an enemy until he proves\nhimself a friend.\"The hostelry was divided into half a dozen rooms, all on the\nground floor.The Rovers were placed in two adjoining apartments,\nwhile the natives and Aleck were quartered in an addition of\nbamboo in the rear.\"Keep your eyes and ears open, Aleck,\" whispered Dick, on\nseparating from the faithful <DW52> man.\"And if you find\nanything wrong let us know at once.\"\"Do you suspect anyt'ing, Massah Rober?\"Something in the air seems to tell me that\neverything is not as it should be.\"\"Dat Frenchman don't look like no angel, sah,\" and Aleck shook his\nhead doubtfully.\"You're right, Aleck, and his wife is a terror, or else I miss my\nguess.\"\"Dat's right, Massah Rober; nebber saw sech sharp eyes.Yes, I'll\nlook out-fo' my own sake as well as fo' de sake ob Ye and de\nrest,\" concluded Aleck.CHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE ATTACK AT THE HOSTELRY\n\n\nThe night was exceptionally cool for that locality; and, utterly\nworn out by their tiresome journey, all of the Rovers slept more\nsoundly than they had anticipated.Dick had scarcely dropped off when he heard a\nnoise at the doorway, which was covered with a rough grass\ncurtain.\"Dat's all right,\" came in a whisper from Aleck.\"I dun discovered somet'ing, sah.\"\"Dat udder party dun come up an' is in de woods back ob dis,\nhouse.\"\"No; dare is a Frenchman wot is talkin' to dah chap wot runs dis\nshebang, sah.\"\"Perhaps he wants accommodations,\" mused Dick.But de fellers who come up hab a lot\nob ropes wid 'em.\"came sleepily from Tom, and presently Randolph\nRover and Sam likewise awoke.In a few words the <DW52> man explained the situation.He had\njust finished when the wife of the proprietor of the resort came\nup to the doorway.\"The gentleman is wanted outside by my husband,\" she said in\nbroken French.But he says please to step out for a moment.\"Rover repeated the woman's words to the boys.\"I tell you something is wrong,\" declared Dick.\"If you go outside I'll go with you, Uncle Randolph.\"\"Well, you can do that if you wish.\"The pair arose and speedily slipped on the few garments which they\nhad taken off.\"Do you think it is as bad as that?\"But I'm going to take uncle's advice\nand count every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend.\"Rover and Dick were ready to go out, and they did so,\nfollowed by Aleck and preceded by the native woman.As it was\ndark the Rovers easily concealed their weapons in the bosoms of\ntheir coats.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.They walked past the bamboo addition and to the grove of trees\nAleck had mentioned.There they found the Frenchman in\nconversation with Captain Villaire.\"Very much,\" answered Villaire in French.\"I believe you are hunting for the young man's father?\"\"Yes; but a prisoner, and very sick.He heard of your being in\nBoma by accident through a native of King Susko's tribe who was\nsent to the town for some supplies.I heard the story and I have\nbeen employed to lead you to him, and at once.\"\"But--but this is marvelous,\" stammered Randolph Rover.\"I must\nsay I do not understand it.\"\"It is a very queer turn of affairs, I admit.Rover\nmust explain to you when you meet.He wishes you to come to him\nalone.As well as he was able Randolph Rover explained matters to Dick.In the meantime, however, the youth had been looking around\nsharply and had noted several forms gliding back and forth in the\ngloom under the trees.\"Uncle Randolph, I don't believe this man,\" he said briefly.\"I think so myself, Dick; but still--\"\n\n\"Why didn't this man come straight to the house to tell us this?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Randolph Rover put the question to Captain Villaire.The\nFrenchman scowled deeply and shrugged his shoulders.\"I had my\nreason,\" he said briefly.Before Randolph Rover could answer there came a shout from behind\nseveral trees.repeated Dick, when of a sudden a half dozen men rushed\nat him and Randolph Rover and surrounded the pair.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.In a twinkle,\nbefore either could use his pistol, he was hurled flat and made a\nprisoner.\"Bind them, men,\" ordered Villaire sternly.\"And bind them well,\nso that escape is impossible.\"yelled, out Dick, before those on top\nof him could choke him off.And off he sped at top\nspeed, with three or four of Captain Villaire's party after him.Cujo also went to the house, bewildered by what was going on and\nhardly knowing how to turn.Randolph Rover fought desperately and so did Dick.But the two\nwere no match for the six men who had attacked them, and ere they\nknew it the Rovers were close prisoners, with their hands bound\nbehind them and each with a dirty gag of grass stuffed in his\nmouth.\"Now march, or you will be shot,\" came in bad English from one of\nthe Villaire party.And as there seemed nothing better to do they\nmarched, wondering why they had been attacked and where they were\nto be taken.Their arms had been confiscated, so further\nresistance was useless.When Dick lagged behind he received a\ncruel blow on the back which nearly sent him headlong.A journey of several hours brought the party to a small clearing\noverlooking the Congo at a point where the bank was fully fifty\nfeet above the surface of the stream.Here, in years gone by, a\nrough log hut had been built, which the African International\nAssociation had once used as a fort during a war with the natives.The log hut was in a state of decay, but still fit for use and\nalmost hidden from view by the dense growth of vines which covered\nit.The men who had brought Randolph Rover and Dick hither evidently\nknew all about the hut, for they proceeded to make themselves at\nhome without delay.Taking the Rovers into one of the apartments\nof the dilapidated building they tied each to the logs of the\nwalls, one several yards from the other.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.\"Now you must wait until Captain Villaire returns,\" said the\nleader of the party in French.\"He will tell you what it means,\" grinned the brigand, and walked\naway to another part of the hut, which was built in a long,\nrambling fashion, and contained a dozen or more divisions.\"We are in a pickle,\" remarked Dick dismally.\"This is hunting\nup father with a vengeance.\"But I would like to know what this\nmeans.\"\"It probably means robbery, for one thing, Uncle Randolph.\"If I am not mistaken I saw some of these rascals hanging around\nthe hotel in Boma.\"They have been watching their chance\nto attack us ever since we left the town.\"Slowly the hours wore away until morning dawned.The positions of\nboth Dick and his uncle were most uncomfortable ones, and the\nyouth was ready to groan aloud at the strain put upon his\nshoulders through having his arms tied behind him.At last they heard footsteps approaching from the opposite end of\nthe rambling building.He had scarcely spoken when Captain Villaire appeared, followed\nby--Dan Baxter!CHAPTER XVIII\n\nA DEMAND OF IMPORTANCE\n\n\nDick could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyesight as he\ngazed at the former bully of Putnam Hall and the Frenchman who\nstood beside him.\"Well, that's a good one, I must\nsay.\"He is in with these rascals who have captured us,\" came quickly\nfrom Dick.\"This is how you repay our kindness, Baxter?\"Didn't I refuse your\noffer, made just before you went away?\"\"But you didn't refuse the first money we gave you, Baxter.\"\"We won't talk about that, Dick\nRover.Do you realize that you are absolutely in my power?\"It was not you who captured us, Baxter.\"\"Well, it amounts to the same thing, eh, Capitan Villaire?\"and\nthe big boy turned to the French brigand, who nodded.\"Ve will not speak of zem udders,\" broke in Captain Villaire.\"Ve\nvill speak apout you.\"\"Did Baxter put up this plot against us?\"To be sure I did,\" answered Baxter, who loved to brag just as\nmuch as ever.\"And before I let", "question": "Where is Sandra?

attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered\ntheir course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the\nCassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds\nalighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching\ninto the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,\ndaylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured\nduring the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was\nafter birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of\nthese night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being\nfairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.The larger tunnels\nof the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,\nwhile the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the\nflat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with\nmany turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were\ninvariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this\nspecies, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,\nboth sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above\nthe surf.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand\ninto their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at

and plaintive;\nthey say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve\neither of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what\na lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop\ndown into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off\na Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than\nChickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird\nonce in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am\nhungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the\nbarnyard.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve\nthe name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber\nare the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old\ncrow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in\na soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When\nwe build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,\nlined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady\nRed-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old\nlady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on\nhe rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go\nto his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually\nsucceed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid\nof them, oh no!We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,\nwho harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to\nrout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him\nto the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently\nfollows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little\nassailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,\nas well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to\nknow it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits\nthe woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,\nMoles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or\nBob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the\ntimber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its\nnatural haunts.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might\ndestroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from\nthe perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long\ntime without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho\nFalls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this\nspecies from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine\ndays after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and\nhe allowed them to hatch and rear their young.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.One winter during his\nabsence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,\nor cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found\nthem building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time\nin a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that\nthey become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which\nthey vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within\ntheir limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being\nespecially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of\nWinter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though\nit does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or\nfour--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white\nor brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades\nof reddish brown.According to\nDavie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the\nvariation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this\nmust be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species\nvary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong\nwith a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the\nair, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of\nthe wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,\nwhile thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,\nthat, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous\ncuriosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.Its\nDoves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to\nevery lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that\nthey fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless\nnumbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found\non the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but\nas a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,\nhowever, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as\nlarge, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.Their plumage\nis of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally\none of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a\nhandful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand\nor shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed\na pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when\nthey are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of\nSan Marco.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one\nintentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will\ncrowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until\nyou can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread\nfor their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who\nmust certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger\nmakes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they\nwill collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,\nand in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are\nfound perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally\nwe will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never\nappear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell\ntower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite\nroosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a\nforeigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of\nwhich attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and\nthe extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which\nstruck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:\n\nCenturies ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,\nand army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called\nDoges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic\nand cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as\na port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as\na consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather\nindifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by\none and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they\nstood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during\none of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city\nhad been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming\nto such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of\nlack of food.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow\nthe city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups\non the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,\nwhen lo!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon\nthe city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned\nsupreme, and men asked each other: \"What new calamity is this?\"As the\ncloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,\nwhich, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully\nsettled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, \"The Doves!It\nappears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times\nfor Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,\nthere would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace\nand happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of\nattacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet\nalso stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity\nwould reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves\nwould leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into\noblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it\nwas told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,\nbut they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of\nVenice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San\nMarco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous\nDoges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the\npalace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What\na boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the\ndoomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now\ndeserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by\nthe inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San\nMarco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that\nthey may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._\n\n\n\n\nBUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,\nthat \"the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,\ncreeping caterpillars\" should be almost as numerous in October as in\nthe balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some\nparts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year\nfor the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not\nquite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect\ncondition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and\nremain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,\ndoes not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly\nwith us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these\ndelicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of\nthe mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current\nLiterature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,\nand they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines\nas the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky\nmotions.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the\nground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders\ntheir identification easy.They are seen at their best in August and\nSeptember.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.All June and July Butterflies are August and September\nButterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still\nplentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal\nfoliage.The \"little wood brownies,\" or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and\nretirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over\nthe shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but\nthey", "question": "Where is John?

my eye deep set--like\na robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You\ncouldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the\ndead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for\na Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I\ndidn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest\nstream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout\nin the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing\nby his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the\nwater and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes\nto be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap\ngo my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,\nthe ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up\ntheir long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the\nhillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop\nand fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,\nand other Birds.For dessert I have\nonly to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and\ngrapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.They grow fat\nand saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of\ntraps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.The Gray Fox is a more\nsouthern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state\nof Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,\naccording to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in\nthis country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does\nthat proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and\nthe smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and\ndiffers from him in being wholly dark gray \"mixed hoary and black.\"He\nalso differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will\noften ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect\none, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the\nFox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels\nvery much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,\nhowever, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the\nscent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil\nof a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or\nfive cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers\nthey assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very\nlikely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.An amusing incident,\nhe relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will\nbear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by\nmeans of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had\nbeen making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the\nneighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that\naccount.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,\nand accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The\nhole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious\nand continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and\nRep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had\nwaxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous\nmelee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his\nhoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the\nmaze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement\nof the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who\nwith a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding\nhead, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of\nthe turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid\naside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over\nthe crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,\nwill soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers\nof very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular\nruns, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and\nthe use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw\noff the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support\ntheir ancient reputation for cunning.RURAL BIRD LIFE IN INDIA.--\"Nothing gives more delight,\" writes Mr.Caine, \"in traveling through rural India than the bird-life that\nabounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a\npoultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,\nRing-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry\nPalm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out\nof the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is\nalive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every\nsize and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up\nto the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a\ndead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and\npresently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in\ncharge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through\nthe surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers\nflash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight.\"----\n\nWARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory\nof warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have\nbeen made in India by Mr.He concludes\nthat there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous\nbirds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that\nmany, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate\nin comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and\nthree other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most\ndistasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with\nbad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also\nexperimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate\nthe nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----\n\nINCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The\nestablishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led\nto the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United\nStates.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000\nacres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,\n200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild\nBoar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a\npreserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,\nMuledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.\nC. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near\nLenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves\nare Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,\nnear Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,\nWashington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;\nand Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----\n\nROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous\nas during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the\nground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding\ntogether, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in\nflocks, that we could only guess at the number.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.When unmolested, few\nbirds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost\neverywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is\ntimber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very\nabundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without\nunusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or\nyellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this\ncolor through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels\nare often found associating together.They are said to be in every\nrespect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every\ndetail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as\ndistinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,\nan anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct\nexplanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning\njust after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their\nhole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when\nthey again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter\nlies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and\nchattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless\non a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the\nslightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is\ntaken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he\nat all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular\nlocality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black\nSquirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have\nseveral young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very\nremarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast\nand other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the\nNiagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed\nto hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The\ncurrent is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally\nventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,\nsucceeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the\npoint of entrance.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them\nto be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a\nboy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel\ninto deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The\n\"sport\" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a\nrebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any\nhousehold tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless\nenmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is\nwilling to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with\nthem, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to\nexterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and\nwas rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white\nRabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before\nbeen molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field\nsomething of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to\nsee examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,\n    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,\n      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,\n      I only meant to give him a scare,\n      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--\n      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see\n      He never would sing for you or me\n      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,\n      Never more in the sunshine bright,\n      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,\n      How never, never, I can repay\n      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works\non ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most\ncurious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South\nAmerica, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent\noccurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges\nof shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move\nin flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking\nand probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,\ninsects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; \"but at the\nreport of a gun,\" says Col.Goss, \"or any sudden fright, spring into\nthe air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying\nswift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted\noften circle and drop back

a moment later I stood outside the tent.The\nopen flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living\ncreature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance\nrevealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards\nfrom me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of\nthe bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded\nopportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under\na variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the\nlight Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the\nsame time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of\nthe syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_.\"The bird\nmay frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,\nits enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,\nand that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for\nhigh and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a\ndepression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are\nfour, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Why was the sight\n    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,\n    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,\n    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;\n    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON.\"But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited.\"The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration\nare capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,\nthe mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of\nthought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges\nin power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light\nand darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects\nof various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a\n mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the\nlight which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist\nnot far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was\nonce merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action\nof light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the\nleast complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the\nfront of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain\nsubstances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to\ncontinued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina\nhas apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a\nfly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical\nor all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving\nthat heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along\nthe line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium\nthe presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that\ncertain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly\nby the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat\nwaves as such have no effect upon the retina.Rigby, but continually bestowed on him glances which painfully\naffected the appetite of that gentleman.In a hundred ways it was\nintimated to Mr.Rigby that he was not a welcome guest, and yet\nsomething was continually given him to do which rendered it impossible\nfor him to take his departure.In this state of affairs, another event\noccurred which changed the current of feeling, and by its possible\nconsequences distracted the Marquess from his brooding meditations over\nhis discomfiture in the matter of Hellingsley.The Prince Colonna, who,\nsince the steeple-chase, had imbibed a morbid predilection for such\namusements, and indeed for every species of rough-riding, was thrown\nfrom his horse and killed on the spot.This calamity broke up the party at Coningsby, which was not at the\nmoment very numerous.Rigby, by command, instantly seized the\nopportunity of preventing the arrival of other guests who were expected.Rigby resuming in a great measure\nhis old position in the Castle.There were a great many things to\nbe done, and all disagreeable; he achieved them all, and studied\neverybody's convenience.Coroners' inquests, funerals especially,\nweeping women, these were all spectacles which Lord Monmouth could not\nendure, but he was so high-bred, that he would not for the world\nthat there should be in manner or degree the slightest deficiency in\npropriety or even sympathy.But he wanted somebody to do everything that\nwas proper; to be considerate and consoling and sympathetic.Rigby\ndid it all; gave evidence at the inquest, was chief mourner at the\nfuneral, and arranged everything so well that not a single emblem of\ndeath crossed the sight of Lord Monmouth; while Madame Colonna found\nsubmission in his exhortations, and the Princess Lucretia, a little more\npale and pensive than usual, listened with tranquillity to his discourse\non the vanity of all sublunary things.When the tumult had subsided, and habits and feelings had fallen into\ntheir old routine and relapsed into their ancient channels, the\nMarquess proposed that they should all return to London, and with great\nformality, though with warmth, begged that Madame Colonna would ever\nconsider his roof as her own.All were glad to quit the Castle, which\nnow presented a scene so different from its former animation, and Madame\nColonna, weeping, accepted the hospitality of her friend, until the\nimpending expansion of the spring would permit her to return to Italy.This notice of her return to her own country seemed to occasion the\nMarquess great disquietude.After they had remained about a month in London, Madame Colonna sent\nfor Mr.Rigby one morning to tell him how very painful it was to her\nfeelings to remain under the roof of Monmouth House without the sanction\nof a husband; that the circumstance of being a foreigner, under such\nunusual affliction, might have excused, though not authorised, the step\nat first, and for a moment; but that the continuance of such a course\nwas quite out of the question; that she owed it to herself, to her\nstep-child, no longer to trespass on this friendly hospitality, which,\nif persisted in, might be liable to misconstruction.Rigby\nlistened with great attention to this statement, and never in the least\ninterrupted Madame Colonna; and then offered to do that which he was\nconvinced the lady desired, namely, to make the Marquess acquainted with\nthe painful state of her feelings.This he did according to his fashion,\nand with sufficient dexterity.Rigby himself was anxious to\nknow which way the wind blew, and the mission with which he had been\nentrusted, fell in precisely with his inclinations and necessities.The\nMarquess listened to the communication and sighed, then turned gently\nround and surveyed himself in the mirror and sighed again, then said to\nRigby,\n\n'You understand exactly what I mean, Rigby.It is quite ridiculous their\ngoing, and infinitely distressing to me.Rigby repaired to the Princess full of mysterious bustle, and with a\nface beaming with importance and satisfaction.He made much of the\ntwo sighs; fully justified the confidence of the Marquess in his\ncomprehension of unexplained intentions; prevailed on Madame Colonna to\nhave some regard for the feelings of one so devoted; expatiated on the\ninsignificance of worldly misconstructions, when replied to by such\nhonourable intentions; and fully succeeded in his mission.Month after month rolled on, and still they stayed; every\nmonth all the family becoming more resigned or more content, and more\ncheerful.As for the Marquess himself, Mr.Rigby never remembered him\nmore serene and even joyous.His Lordship scarcely ever entered general\nsociety.The Colonna family remained in strict seclusion; and he\npreferred the company of these accomplished and congenial friends to the\nmob of the great world.Rigby there had always subsisted\nconsiderable confidence.Now, that gentleman seemed to have achieved\nfresh and greater claims to her regard.In the pleasure with which he\nlooked forward to her approaching alliance with his patron, he reminded\nher of the readiness with which he had embraced her suggestions for the\nmarriage of her daughter with Coningsby.Always obliging, she was never\nwearied of chanting his praises to her noble admirer, who was apparently\nmuch gratified she should have bestowed her esteem on one of whom she\nwould necessarily in after-life see so much.It is seldom the lot of\nhusbands that their confidential friends gain the regards of their\nbrides.'I am glad you all like Rigby,' said Lord Monmouth, 'as you will see so\nmuch of him.'The remembrance of the Hellingsley failure seemed to be erased from the\nmemory of the Marquess.Rigby never recollected him more cordial and\nconfidential, and more equable in his manner.He told Rigby one day,\nthat he wished that Monmouth House should possess the most sumptuous\nand the most fanciful boudoir in London or Paris.That gentleman consulted the first artists, and gave them some hints in\nreturn; his researches on domestic decoration ranged through all\nages; he even meditated a rapid tour to mature his inventions; but his\nconfidence in his native taste and genius ultimately convinced him that\nthis movement was unnecessary.The summer advanced; the death of the King occurred; the dissolution\nsummoned Rigby to Coningsby and the borough of Darlford.His success was\nmarked certain in the secret books of Tadpole and Taper.A manufacturing\ntown, enfranchised under the Reform Act, already gained by the\nConservative cause!Influence of character, too; for no one was so popular as Lord Monmouth;\na most distinguished nobleman of strict Conservative principles, who,\nif he carried the county and the manufacturing borough also, merited the\nstrawberry-leaf.'There will be no holding Rigby,' said Taper; 'I'm afraid he will be\nlooking for something very high.''The higher the better,' rejoined Tadpole, 'and then he will not\ninterfere with us.I like your high-flyers; it is your plodders I\ndetest, wearing old hats and high-lows, speaking in committee, and\nthinking they are men of business: d----n them!'Rigby went down, and made some impressive speeches; at least they read\nvery well in some of his second-rate journals, where all the uproar\nfigured as loud cheering, and the interruption of a cabbage-stalk was\nrepresented as a question from some intelligent individual in the crowd.The fact is, Rigby bored his audience too much with history, especially\nwith the French Revolution, which he fancied was his 'forte,' so that\nthe people at last, whenever he made any allusion to the subject, were\nalmost as much terrified as if they had seen the guillotine.Rigby had as yet one great advantage; he had no opponent; and without\npersonal opposition, no contest can be very bitter.It was for some days\nRigby _versus_ Liberal principles; and Rigby had much the best of it;\nfor he abused Liberal principles roundly in his harangues, who, not\nbeing represented on the occasion, made no reply; while plenty of ale,\nand some capital songs by Lucian Gay, who went down express, gave the\nright cue to the mob, who declared in chorus, beneath the windows of\nRigby's hotel, that he was 'a fine old English gentleman!'But there was to be a contest; no question about that, and a sharp\none, although Rigby was to win, and well.The Liberal party had been so\nfastidious about their new candidate, that they had none ready though\nseveral biting.Jawster Sharp thought at one time that sheer necessity\nwould give him another chance still; but even Rigby was preferable to\nJawster Sharp, who, finding it would not do, published his long-prepared\nvaledictory address, in which he told his constituents, that having long\nsacrificed his health to their interests, he was now obliged to retire\ninto the bosom of his family.And a very well-provided-for family, too.All this time the Liberal deputation from Darlford, two aldermen, three\ntown-councillors, and the Secretary of the Reform Association, were\nwalking about London like mad things, eating luncheons and looking for\na candidate.They called at the Reform Club twenty times in the morning,\nbadgered whips and red-tapers; were introduced to candidates, badgered\ncandidates; examined would-be members as if they were at a cattle-show,\nlistened to political pedigrees, dictated political pledges, referred\nto Hansard to see how men had voted, inquired whether men had spoken,\nfinally discussed terms.If\nthe principles were right, there was no money; and if money were ready,\nmoney would not take pledges.In fact, they wanted a Phoenix: a very\nrich man, who would do exactly as they liked, with extremely low\nopinions and with very high connections.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.'If he would go for the ballot and had a handle to his name, it would\nhave the best effect,' said the secretary of the Reform Association,\n'because you see we are fighting against a Right Honourable, and you\nhave no idea how that takes with the mob.'The deputation had been three days in town, and urged by despatches\nby every train to bring affairs to a conclusion; jaded, perplexed,\nconfused, they were ready to fall into the hands of the first jobber\nor bold adventurer.They discussed over their dinner at a Strand\ncoffee-house the claims of the various candidates who had presented\nthemselves.Donald Macpherson Macfarlane, who would only pay the\nlegal expenses; he was soon despatched.Gingerly Browne, of Jermyn\nStreet, the younger son of a baronet, who would go as far as 1000_l._\nprovided the seat was secured.Juggins, a distiller, 2000_l._ man;\nbut would not agree to any annual subscriptions.Sir Baptist Placid,\nvague about expenditure, but repeatedly declaring that 'there could\nbe no difficulty on that head.'He however had a moral objection to\nsubscribing to the races, and that was a great point at Darlford.Sir\nBaptist would subscribe a guinea per annum to the infirmary, and the\nsame to all religious societies without any distinction of sects; but\nraces, it was not the sum, 100_l._ per annum, but the principle.In short, the deputation began to suspect, what was the truth, that they\nwere a day after the fair, and that all the electioneering rips that\nswarm in the purlieus of political clubs during an impending dissolution\nof Parliament, men who become political characters in their small circle\nbecause they have been talked of as once having an intention to stand\nfor places for which they never offered themselves, or for having stood\nfor places where they never could by any circumstance have succeeded,\nwere in fact nibbling at their dainty morsel.At this moment of despair, a ray of hope was imparted to them by a\nconfidential note from a secretary of the Treasury, who wished to\nsee them at the Reform Club on the morrow.You may be sure they were\npunctual to their appointment.The secretary received them with great\nconsideration.He had got them a candidate, and one of high mark, the\nson of a Peer, and connected with the highest Whig houses.If they liked he would introduce them\nimmediately to the Honourable Al", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "He had only to introduce\nthem, as there was no difficulty either as to means or opinions,\nexpenses or pledges.The secretary returned with a young gentleman, whose diminutive stature\nwould seem, from his smooth and singularly puerile countenance, to be\nmerely the consequence of his very tender years; but Mr.De Crecy was\nreally of age, or at least would be by nomination-day.He did not say\na word, but looked like the rosebud which dangled in the button-hole of\nhis frock-coat.The aldermen and town-councillors were what is\nsometimes emphatically styled flabbergasted; they were speechless from\nbewilderment.De Crecy will go for the ballot,' said the secretary\nof the Treasury, with an audacious eye and a demure look, 'and for Total\nand Immediate, if you press him hard; but don't, if you can help it,\nbecause he has an uncle, an old county member, who has prejudices, and\nmight disinherit him.And I am very happy\nthat I have been the means of bringing about an arrangement which,\nI feel, will be mutually advantageous.'And so saying, the secretary\neffected his escape.Circumstances, however, retarded for a season the political career of\nthe Honourable Alberic de Crecy.While the Liberal party at Darlford\nwere suffering under the daily inflictions of Mr.Rigby's slashing\nstyle, and the post brought them very unsatisfactory prospects of a\nchampion, one offered himself, and in an address which intimated that he\nwas no man of straw, likely to recede from any contest in which he\nchose to embark.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.The town was suddenly placarded with a letter to\nthe Independent Electors from Mr.Millbank, the new proprietor of\nHellingsley.He expressed himself as one not anxious to obtrude himself on their\nattention, and founding no claim to their confidence on his recent\nacquisition; but at the same time as one resolved that the free and\nenlightened community, with which he must necessarily hereafter be much\nconnected, should not become the nomination borough of any Peer of the\nrealm without a struggle, if they chose to make one.And so he offered\nhimself if they could not find a better candidate, without waiting for\nthe ceremony of a requisition.He was exactly the man they wanted; and\nthough he had 'no handle to his name,' and was somewhat impracticable\nabout pledges, his fortune was so great, and his character so high, that\nit might be hoped that the people would be almost as content as if\nthey were appealed to by some obscure scion of factitious nobility,\nsubscribing to political engagements which he could not comprehend,\nand which, in general, are vomited with as much facility as they are\nswallowed.The people of Darlford, who, as long as the contest for their\nrepresentation remained between Mr.Rigby and the abstraction called\nLiberal Principles, appeared to be very indifferent about the result,\nthe moment they learned that for the phrase had been substituted a\nsubstance, and that, too, in the form of a gentleman who was soon\nto figure as their resident neighbour, became excited, speedily\nenthusiastic.All the bells of all the churches rang when Mr.Millbank\ncommenced his canvass; the Conservatives, on the alert, if not alarmed,\ninsisted on their champion also showing himself in all directions; and\nin the course of four-and-twenty hours, such is the contagion of popular\nfeeling, the town was divided into two parties, the vast majority of\nwhich were firmly convinced that the country could only be saved by the\nreturn of Mr.Rigby, or preserved from inevitable destruction by the\nelection of Mr.The results of the two canvasses were such as had been anticipated from\nthe previous reports of the respective agents and supporters.In these\ndays the personal canvass of a candidate is a mere form.The whole\ncountry that is to be invaded has been surveyed and mapped out before\nentry; every position reconnoitred; the chain of communications\ncomplete.In the present case, as was not unusual, both candidates were\nreally supported by numerous and reputable adherents; and both had good\ngrounds for believing that they would be ultimately successful.But\nthere was a body of the electors sufficiently numerous to turn the\nelection, who would not promise their votes: conscientious men who felt\nthe responsibility of the duty that the constitution had entrusted to\ntheir discharge, and who would not make up their minds without duly\nweighing the respective merits of the two rivals.This class of deeply\nmeditative individuals are distinguished not only by their pensive turn\nof mind, but by a charitable vein that seems to pervade their being.Not\nonly will they think of your request, but for their parts they wish both\nsides equally well.Decision, indeed, as it must dash the hopes of one\nof their solicitors, seems infinitely painful to them; they have always\na good reason for postponing it.If you seek their suffrage during the\ncanvass, they reply, that the writ not having come down, the day of\nelection is not yet fixed.If you call again to inform them that the\nwrit has arrived, they rejoin, that perhaps after all there may not be a\ncontest.If you call a third time, half dead with fatigue, to give them\nfriendly notice that both you and your rival have pledged yourselves to\ngo to the poll, they twitch their trousers, rub their hands, and with a\ndull grin observe,\n\n'Well, sir, we shall see.'Jobson,' says one of the committee, with an insinuating\nsmile, 'give Mr.'Jobson, I think you and I know each other,' says a most influential\nsupporter, with a knowing nod.'Well, I have not made up my mind yet, gentlemen.'says a solemn voice, 'didn't you tell me the other night you\nwished well to this gentleman?''So I do; I wish well to everybody,' replies the imperturbable Jobson.'Well, Jobson,' exclaims another member of the committee, with a sigh,\n'who could have supposed that you would have been an enemy?''I don't wish to be no enemy to no man, Mr.'Come, Jobson,' says a jolly tanner, 'if I wanted to be a Parliament\nman, I don't think you could refuse me one!''Well, then, give it to my friend.''Well, sir, I'll think about it.''Leave him to me,' says another member of the committee, with a\nsignificant look.'Yes, leave him to Hayfield, Mr.Millbank; he knows how to manage him.'But all the same, Jobson continues to look as little tractable and\nlamb-like as can be well fancied.And here, in a work which, in an unpretending shape, aspires to take\nneither an uninformed nor a partial view of the political history of the\nten eventful years of the Reform struggle, we should pause for a\nmoment to observe the strangeness, that only five years after the\nreconstruction of the electoral body by the Whig party, in a borough\ncalled into political existence by their policy, a manufacturing\ntown, too, the candidate comprising in his person every quality and\ncircumstance which could recommend him to the constituency, and\nhis opponent the worst specimen of the Old Generation, a political\nadventurer, who owed the least disreputable part of his notoriety to\nhis opposition to the Reform Bill; that in such a borough, under such\ncircumstances, there should be a contest, and that, too, one of a very\ndoubtful issue.Are we to seek it in the 'Reaction' of the\nTadpoles and the Tapers?Reaction, to a certain extent, is the law of human existence.In the\nparticular state of affairs before us, England after the Reform Act, it\nnever could be doubtful that Time would gradually, and in some instances\nrapidly, counteract the national impulse of 1832.There never could\nhave been a question, for example, that the English counties would\nhave reverted to their natural allegiance to their proprietors; but the\nresults of the appeals to the third Estate in 1835 and 1837 are not to\nbe accounted for by a mere readjustment of legitimate influences.The truth is, that, considerable as are the abilities of the Whig\nleaders, highly accomplished as many of them unquestionably must be\nacknowledged in parliamentary debate, experienced in council, sedulous\nin office, eminent as scholars, powerful from their position, the\nabsence of individual influence, and of the pervading authority of a\ncommanding mind, have been the cause of the fall of the Whig party.Such a supremacy was generally acknowledged in Lord Grey on the\naccession of this party to power: but it was the supremacy of a\ntradition rather than of a fact.Almost at the outset of his authority\nhis successor was indicated.When the crisis arrived, the intended\nsuccessor was not in the Whig ranks.It is in this virtual absence of\na real and recognised leader, almost from the moment that they passed\ntheir great measure, that we must seek a chief cause of all that\ninsubordination, all those distempered ambitions, and all those dark\nintrigues, that finally broke up, not only the Whig government, but the\nWhig party; demoralised their ranks, and sent them to the country, both\nin 1835 and 1837, with every illusion, which had operated so happily in\ntheir favour in 1832, scattered to the winds.In all things we trace the\nirresistible influence of the individual.And yet the interval that elapsed between 1835 and 1837 proved, that\nthere was all this time in the Whig array one entirely competent to the\noffice of leading a great party, though his capacity for that fulfilment\nwas too tardily recognised.LORD JOHN RUSSELL has that degree of imagination, which, though evinced\nrather in sentiment than expression, still enables him to generalise\nfrom the details of his reading and experience; and to take those\ncomprehensive views, which, however easily depreciated by ordinary\nmen in an age of routine, are indispensable to a statesman in the\nconjunctures in which we live.He understands, therefore, his position;\nand he has the moral intrepidity which prompts him ever to dare that\nwhich his intellect assures him is politic.He is consequently, at the\nsame time, sagacious and bold in council.As an administrator he is\nprompt and indefatigable.He is not a natural orator, and labours under\nphysical deficiencies which even a Demosthenic impulse could scarcely\novercome.But he is experienced in debate, quick in reply, fertile in\nresource, takes large views, and frequently compensates for a dry and\nhesitating manner by the expression of those noble truths that flash\nacross the fancy, and rise spontaneously to the lip, of men of poetic\ntemperament when addressing popular assemblies.If we add to this, a\nprivate life of dignified repute, the accidents of his birth and rank,\nwhich never can be severed from the man, the scion of a great historic\nfamily, and born, as it were, to the hereditary service of the State, it\nis difficult to ascertain at what period, or under what circumstances,\nthe Whig party have ever possessed, or could obtain, a more efficient\nleader.But we must return to the Darlford election.The class of thoughtful\nvoters was sufficiently numerous in that borough to render the result\nof the contest doubtful to the last; and on the eve of the day of\nnomination both parties were equally sanguine.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Nomination-day altogether is an unsatisfactory affair.There is little\nto be done, and that little mere form.The tedious hours remain, and no\none can settle his mind to anything.It is not a holiday, for every one\nis serious; it is not business, for no one can attend to it; it is not\na contest, for there is no canvassing; nor an election, for there is no\npoll.It is a day of lounging without an object, and luncheons without\nan appetite; of hopes and fears; confidence and dejection; bravado bets\nand secret hedging; and, about midnight, of furious suppers of grilled\nbones, brandy-and-water, and recklessness.The president and vice-president of the Conservative Association, the\nsecretary and the four solicitors who were agents, had impressed upon\nMr.Rigby that it was of the utmost importance, and must produce a\ngreat moral effect, if he obtain the show of hands.With his powers of\neloquence and their secret organisation, they flattered themselves it\nmight be done.With this view, Rigby inflicted a speech of more than\ntwo hours' duration on the electors, who bore it very kindly, as the mob\nlikes, above all things, that the ceremonies of nomination-day should\nnot be cut short: moreover, there is nothing that the mob likes so much\nas a speech.Rigby therefore had, on the whole, a far from unfavourable\naudience, and he availed himself of their forbearance.He brought in\nhis crack theme, the guillotine, and dilated so elaborately upon its\nqualities, that one of the gentlemen below could not refrain from\nexclaiming, 'I wish you may get it.'Rigby\nwhat is called a great opening, which, like a practised speaker, he\nimmediately seized.He denounced the sentiment as 'un-English,' and got\nmuch cheered.Excited by this success, Rigby began to call everything\nelse 'un-English' with which he did not agree, until menacing murmurs\nbegan to rise, when he shifted the subject, and rose into a grand\nperoration, in which he assured them that the eyes of the whole empire\nwere on this particular election; cries of 'That's true,' from all\nsides; and that England expected every man to do his duty.'And who do you expect to do yours?'inquired a gentleman below,' about\nthat 'ere pension?''Rigby,' screeched a hoarse voice, 'don't you mind; you guv it them\nwell.''Rigby, keep up your spirits, old chap: we will have you.'said a stentorian voice; and a man as tall as Saul looked round\nhim.This was the engaged leader of the Conservative mob; the eye of\nevery one of his minions was instantly on him.This was a signal for the instant appearance of the leader of the\nLiberal mob.Magog Wrath, not so tall as Bully Bluck, his rival, had\na voice almost as powerful, a back much broader, and a countenance far\nmore forbidding.'Now, my boys, the Queen and Millbank for ever!'These rival cries were the signals for a fight between the two bands of\ngladiators in the face of the hustings, the body of the people little\ninterfering.Bully Bluck seized Magog Wrath's colours; they wrestled,\nthey seized each other; their supporters were engaged in mutual contest;\nit appeared to be a most alarming and perilous fray; several ladies from\nthe windows screamed, one fainted; a band of special constables pushed\ntheir way through the mob; you heard their staves resounded on the\nskulls of all who opposed them, especially the little boys: order was at\nlength restored; and, to tell the truth, the only hurts inflicted were\nthose which came from the special constables.Bully Bluck and Magog\nWrath, with all their fierce looks, flaunting colours, loud cheers, and\ndesperate assaults, were, after all, only a couple of Condottieri, who\nwere cautious never to wound each other.They were, in fact, a peaceful\npolice, who kept the town in awe, and prevented others from being\nmischievous who were more inclined to do harm.Their hired gangs were\nthe safety-valves for all the scamps of the borough, who, receiving a\nfew shillings per head for their nominal service, and as much drink as\nthey liked after the contest, were bribed and organised into peace\nand sobriety on the days in which their excesses were most to be\napprehended.Millbank came forward: he was brief compared with Mr.Rigby; but\nclear and terse.He did not favour his\nhearers with any history, but gave them his views about taxes, free\ntrade, placemen, and pensioners, whoever and wherever they might be.'Hilloa, Rigby, about that 'ere pension?''Never mind, Rigby, you'll come in next time.'Millbank was energetic about resident representatives, but did not\nunderstand that a", "question": "Where is Daniel?

the buffet will\n     serve as usual individual suppers and baskets for two persons.The committee wish especially to bring the attention of their\n     comrades to the question of women, whose cards of admission\n     must be delivered as soon as possible, so as to enlarge their\n     attendance--always insufficient.Prizes (champagne) will be distributed to the ateliers who may\n     distinguish themselves by the artistic merit and beauty of their\n     female display.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]\n\n     All the women who compete for these prizes will be assembled on\n     the grand staircase before the orchestra.The nude, as always, is\n     PROHIBITED!?!The question of music at the head of the procession is of the\n     greatest importance, and those comrades who are musical will please\n     give their names to the delegates of the ateliers.Your good-will\n     in this line is asked for--any great worthless capacity in this\n     line will do, as they always play the same tune, \"Les Pompiers!\"For days before the \"Quat'z' Arts\" ball, all is excitement among the\nstudents, who do as little work as possible and rest themselves for the\ngreat event.The favorite wit of the different ateliers is given the\ntask of painting the banner of the atelier, which is carried at the head\nof the several corteges.One of these, in Bouguereau's atelier, depicted\ntheir master caricatured as a cupid.The boys once constructed an elephant with oriental trappings--an\nelephant that could wag his ears and lift his trunk and snort--and after\nthe two fellows who formed respectfully the front and hind legs of this\nknowing beast had practised sufficiently to proceed with him safely, at\nthe head of a cortege of slave girls, nautch dancers, and manacled\ncaptives, the big beast created a success in the procession at the\n\"Quat'z' Arts\" ball.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]\n\nAfter the ball, in the gray morning light, they marched it back to the\natelier, where it remained for some weeks, finally becoming such a\nnuisance, kicking around the atelier and getting in everybody's way,\nthat the boys agreed to give it to the first junk-man that came around.But as no junk-man came, and as no one could be found to care for its\nnow sadly battered hulk, its good riddance became a problem.At last the two, who had sweltered in its dusty frame that eventful\nnight of the \"Quat'z' Arts,\" hit upon an idea.They marched it one", "question": "Where is Mary?

gladiators hobnob at the tables with\nsavages in scanty attire--Roman soldiers and students, in the garb of\nthe ancients, strut about or chat in groups, while the uninvited\ngrisettes and models, who have not received invitations from the\ncommittee, implore them for tickets.Tickets are not transferable, and should one present himself at the\nentrance of the ball with another fellow's ticket, he would run small\nchance of entering.The student answers, while the jury glance at his makeup.cries the jury, and you pass in to the ball.But if you are unknown they will say simply, \"Connais-pas!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.and you pass down a long covered alley--confident, if you are a\n\"nouveau,\" that it leads into the ball-room--until you suddenly find\nyourself in the street, where your ticket is torn up and all hope of\nentering is gone.It is hopeless to attempt to describe the hours until morning of this\nannual artistic orgy.As the morning light comes in through the\nwindows, it is strange to see the effect of diffused daylight,\nelectricity, and gas--the bluish light of early morning reflected on the\nflesh tones--upon nearly three thousand girls and students in costumes\none might expect to see in a bacchanalian feast, just before the fall of\nRome.Now they form a huge circle, the front row sitting on the floor,\nthe second row squatting, the third seated in chairs, the fourth\nstanding, so that all can see the dancing that begins in the morning\nhours--the wild impromptu dancing of the moment.A famous beauty, her\nblack hair bound in a golden fillet with a circle wrought in silver and\nstudded with Oriental turquoises clasping her superb torso, throws her\nsandals to the crowd and begins an Oriental dance--a thing of grace and\nbeauty--fired with the intensity of the innate nature of this\nbeautifully modeled daughter of Bohemia.As the dance ends, there is a cry of delight from the great circle of\nbarbarians.\"Long live the Quat'z' Arts!\"they cry, amid cheers for the\ndancer.The ball closes about seven in the morning, when the long procession\nforms to return to the Latin Quarter, some marching, other students and\ngirls in cabs and on top of them, many of the girls riding the horses.Down they come from the \"Moulin Rouge,\" shouting, singing, and yelling.Heads are thrust out of windows, and a volley of badinage passes between\nthe fantastic procession and those who have heard them coming.Finally the great open court of the Louvre is reached--here a halt is\nmade and a general romp occurs.A girl and a type climb one of the\ntall lamp-posts and prepare to do a mid-air balancing act, when\nrescued by the others.At last, at the end of all this horse-play, the\nmarch is resumed over the Pont du Carrousel and so on, cheered now by\nthose going to work, until the Odeon is reached.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Here the odd\nprocession disbands; some go to their favorite cafes where the\nfestivities are continued--some to sleep in their costumes or what\nremains of them, wherever fortune lands them--others to studios, where\nthe gaiety is often kept up for days.but life is not all \"couleur de rose\" in this true Bohemia.\"One day,\" says little Marguerite (she who lives in the rue Monge), \"one\neats and the next day one doesn't.It is always like that, is it not,\nmonsieur?--and it costs so much to live, and so you see, monsieur, life\nis always a fight.\"And Marguerite's brown eyes swim a little and her pretty mouth closes\nfirmly.\"I do not know, monsieur,\" she replies quietly; \"I have not seen him in\nten days--the atelier is closed--I have been there every day, expecting\nto find him--he left no word with his concierge.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.I have been to his cafe\ntoo, but no one has seen him--you see, monsieur, Paul does not love me!\"I recall an incident that I chanced to see in passing the little shop\nwhere Marguerite works, that only confirms the truth of her realization.Paul had taken Marguerite back to the little shop, after their dejeuner\ntogether, and, as I passed, he stopped at the door with her, kissed her\non both cheeks, and left her; but before they had gone a dozen paces,\nthey ran back to embrace again.This occurred four times, until Paul and\nMarguerite finally parted.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.And, as he watched her little heels disappear\nup the wooden stairs to her work-room above, Paul blew a kiss to the\npretty milliner at the window next door, and, taking a long whiff of his\ncigarette, sauntered off in the direction of his atelier whistling.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.[Illustration: A MORNING'S WORK]\n\nIt is ideal, this student life with its student loves of four years, but\nis it right to many an honest little comrade, who seldom knows an hour\nwhen she is away from her ami?who has suffered and starved and slaved\nwith him through years of days of good and bad luck--who has encouraged\nhim in his work, nursed him when ill, and made a thousand golden hours\nin this poet's or painter's life so completely happy, that he looks back\non them in later life as never-to-be-forgotten?He remembers the good\ndinners at the little restaurant near his studio, where they dined among\nthe old crowd.There were Lavaud the sculptor and Francine, with the\nfigure of a goddess; Moreau, who played the cello at the opera; little\nLouise Dumont, who posed at Julian's, and old Jacquemart, the very soul\nof good fellowship, who would set them roaring with his inimitable\nhumor.What good dinners they were!--and how long they sat over their coffee\nand cigarettes under the trees in front of this little restaurant--often\nten and twelve at a time, until more tables had to be pushed together\nfor others of their good friends, who in passing would be hailed to join\nthem.And how Marguerite used to sing all through dinner and how they\nwould all sing, until it grew so late and so dark that they had to puff\ntheir cigarettes aglow over their plates, and yell to Madame Giraud for\na light!And how the old lady would bustle out with the little oil lamp,\nplacing it in the center of the long table amid the forest of vin\nordinaires, with a \"Voila, mes enfants!\"and a cheery word for all these\ngood boys and girls, whom she regarded quite as her own children.It seemed to them then that there would never be anything else but\ndinners at Madame Giraud's for as many years as they pleased, for no one\never thought of living out one's days, except in this good Bohemia of\nParis.They could not imagine that old Jacquemart would ever die, or\nthat La Belle Louise would grow old, and go back to Marseilles, to live\nwith her dried-up old aunt, who sold garlic and bad cheese in a little\nbox of a shop, up a crooked street!Or that Francine would marry Martin,\nthe painter, and that the two would bury themselves in an adorable\nlittle spot in Brittany, where they now live in a thatched farm-house,\nfull of Martin's pictures, and have a vegetable garden of their own--and\na cow--and some children![Illustration: A STUDIO DEJEUNER]\n\nAnd those memorable dinners in the old studio back of the Gare\nMontparnasse!when paints and easels were pushed aside, and the table\nspread, and the piano rolled up beside it.There was the buying of the\nchicken, and the salad that Francine would smother in a dressing into\nwhich she would put a dozen different things--herbs and spices and tiny\nwhite onions!<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.And what a jolly crowd came to these impromptu feasts!How they danced and sang until the gray\nmorning light would creep in through the big skylight, when all these\ngood bohemians would tiptoe down the waxed stairs, and slip past the\ndifferent ateliers for fear of waking those painters who might be\nasleep--a thought that never occurred to them until broad daylight, and\nthe door had been opened, after hours of pandemonium and music and\nnoise!In a little hotel near the Odeon, there lived a family of just such\nbohemians--six struggling poets, each with an imagination and a love of\ngood wine and good dinners and good times that left them continually in\na state of bankruptcy!As they really never had any money--none that\never lasted for more than two days and two nights at the utmost, their\ngood landlord seldom saw a sou in return for his hospitable roof, which\nhad sheltered these six great minds who wrote of the moon, and of fate,\nand fortune, and love.For days they would dream and starve and write.Then followed an auction\nsale of the total collection of verses, hawked about anywhere and\neverywhere among the editeurs, like a crop of patiently grown fruit.Having sold it, literally by the yard, they would all saunter up the\n\"Boul' Miche,\" and forget their past misery, in feasting, to their\nhearts' content, on the good things of life.On days like these, you\nwould see them passing, their black-brimmed hats adjusted jauntily over\ntheir poetic locks--their eyes beaming with that exquisite sense of\nfeeling suddenly rich, that those who live for art's sake know!The\nkeenest of pleasures lie in sudden contrasts, and to these six poetic,\nimpractical Bohemians, thus suddenly raised from the slough of despond\nto a state where they no longer trod with mortals--their cup of\nhappiness was full and spilling over.They must not only have a good\ntime, but so must every one around them.With their great riches, they\nwould make the world gay as long as it lasted, for when it was over they\nknew how sad life would be.For a while--then they would scratch\naway--and have another auction!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.[Illustration: DAYLIGHT]\n\nUnlike another good fellow, a painter whom I once knew, who periodically\nfound himself without a sou, and who would take himself, in despair, to\nhis lodgings, make his will, leaving most of his immortal works to his\nEnglish aunt, go to bed, and calmly await death!In a fortunate space of\ntime his friends, who had been hunting for him all over the Quarter,\nwould find him at last and rescue him from his chosen tomb; or his good\naunt, fearing he was ill, would send a draft!Then life would, to this\nimpractical philosopher, again become worth living.He would dispatch a\n\"petit bleu\" to Marcelle; and the two would meet at the Cafe Cluny, and\ndine at La Perruse on filet de sole au vin blanc, and a bottle of Haut\nBarsac--the bottle all cobwebs and cradled in its basket--the garcon, as\nhe poured its golden contents, holding his breath meanwhile lest he\ndisturb its long slumber.There are wines that stir the soul, and this was one of them--clear as a\ntopaz and warming as the noonday sun--the same warmth that had given it\nbirth on its hillside in Bordeaux, as far back as '82.It warmed the\nheart of Marcelle, too, and made her cheeks glow and her eyes\nsparkle--and added a rosier color to her lips.It made her talk--clearly\nand frankly, with a full and a happy heart, so that she confessed her\nlove for this \"bon garcon\" of a painter, and her supreme admiration for\nhis work and the financial success he had made with his art.All of\nwhich this genial son of Bohemia drank in with a feeling of pride, and\nhe would swell out his chest and curl the ends of his long mustache\nupwards, and sigh like a man burdened with money, and secure in his\nability and success, and with a peaceful outlook into the future--and\nthe fact that Marcelle loved him of all men!They would linger long over\ntheir coffee and cigarettes, and then the two would stroll out under the\nstars and along the quai, and watch the little Seine boats crossing and\nrecrossing, like fireflies, and the lights along the Pont Neuf reflected\ndeep down like parti-colored ribbons in the black water.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.[Illustration: (pair of high heeled shoes)]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\"A DEJEUNER AT LAVENUE'S\"\n\n\nIf you should chance to breakfast at \"Lavenue's,\" or, as it is called,\nthe \"Hotel de France et Bretagne,\" for years famous as a rendezvous of\nmen celebrated in art and letters, you will be impressed first with the\nsimplicity of the three little rooms forming the popular side of this\nrestaurant, and secondly with the distinguished appearance of its\nclientele.[Illustration: MADEMOISELLE FANNY AND HER STAFF]\n\nAs you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the\ndesk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that\ndesk for forty years, and has seen many a \"bon garcon\" struggle up the\nladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,\nuntil his name became known the world over.It has long been a\nfavorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the\npainter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,\nand dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like\nWhistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the \"other\nside,\" as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a\ngorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another\nroom--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and\nmirrors.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with\nthe three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red\nribbons in their buttonholes;

they come in, many of\nthem, fresh from a hard morning's work in the studio.The tall sculptor\nopposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for\nthe government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been\nbuilding up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,\nall the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a\ngiantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her\nexistence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an\nAmerican building.The \"giantess\" in the flesh is lunching with him--a\nJuno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,\nher figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,\nquiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will\nsurprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been\nthrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a\nsmattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of\nthe theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and\nlaw and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in\nthe cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This \"vernis,\" as the\nFrench call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their\ndays are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and\nenergy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the\nstudio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]\n\nThe painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a\ndecorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,\nfrom careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,\nlaying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month\nlater, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of\nthe blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,\nmayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at\ntwo, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast\nliner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the\nHudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be\nunrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where\nits rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids\nand the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will\nappear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from\nIthaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and\npotatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and\nagree \"it's grand.\"But the painter does not care, for he has locked up\nhis studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came\nat two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des\nLilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt\nterrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is\nthe farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just\nopposite the \"Bal Bullier,\" on the Place de l'Observatoire.The terrace\nis crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of\npeople along the \"Boul' Miche.\"The terrace is quite dark, its only\nlight coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,\ntoo, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg\nGardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very\nwell-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]\n\nAt the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the\nconcierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed\nand furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this\nfaithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the\nden of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old\nswords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place\nis quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day\nand talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the\nnumber of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your\ncourt by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is\nwaked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court\nfull of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your\nconcierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters\nwho do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the\nguardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of\nPere Valois--all the morning you will see these little \"femmes de\nmenage\" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and\nbeds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at\nall, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be\ntaken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your \"femme de menage\" does\nnot know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will\nregale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,\nincluding your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,\nalways concluding with: \"That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is\nquite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of\nMonsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in\nthe rue du Cherche Midi.\"In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress\nwith her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the\nevening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the \"Bal Bullier,\" or\ndining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]\n\nAlice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage\nthan any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was\nharder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,\nwhen barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her\nname and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After\nmany days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de\nMarcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,\nwith her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in\norder to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a\ndemi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of\nthis--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found\nemployment at a baker's, where she was obliged to get up at four in the\nmorning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the\ndifferent houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid\nher a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie\nturned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering\nbread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced\nto meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to\nrelieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice\nfairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty\nfrancs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave\nlittle Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]\n\n\"You see, monsieur, one must do one's best whatever one undertakes,\"\nsaid Alice to me; \"I have tried every profession, and now I am a good\nfemme de menage, and I am 'bien contente.'No,\" she continued, \"I shall\nnever marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.When one marries,\" she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,\n\"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I\ncan work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,\nand I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,\nwhere, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for\nbon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in\nmy dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the\nwife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,\nfor he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a\ncharming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.CHAPTER VI\n\n\"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S\"\n\n\nJust off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,\nyou will see at night the name \"Marcel Legay\" illumined in tiny\ngas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as \"Le Grillon,\" where\na dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience\nin the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as\nthe piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed\none)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,\npoet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs\nof Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]\n\nFrom these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest\nand most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they\nhave absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no\nmincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the\ntrouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with\nthe Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique\nFrancaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by\nthem, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of\nthe day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of\ngood-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should\nevince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,\nwho are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never\nvulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility\nenables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little\nsong with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause\nthat follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from\nthe heart.It is not to be wondered at that \"The Grillon\" of Marcel Legay's is a\npopular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little\nroom nightly.You enter the \"Grillon\" by way of the bar, and at the\nfurther end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in\nclever posters and original drawings.XIV., that all noble ornamentation\nwas the expression of man's delight in God's work.This implied that\nthere was an _ig_noble ornamentation, which was the expression of man's\ndelight in his _own_.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.There is such a school, chiefly degraded classic\nand Renaissance, in which the ornament is composed of imitations of\ntilings made by man.I think, before inquiring what we like best of\nGod's work, we had better get rid of all this imitation of man's, and be\nquite sure we do not like _that_.We shall rapidly glance, then, at the material of decoration\nhence derived.And now I cannot, as I before have done respecting\nconstruction, _convince_ the reader of one thing being wrong, and\nanother right.I have confessed as much again and again; I am now only\nto make appeal to him, and cross-question him, whether he really does\nlike things or not.If he likes the ornament on the base of the column\nof the Place Vendome, composed of Wellington boots and laced frock\ncoats, I cannot help it; I can only say I differ from him, and don't\nlike it.And if, therefore, I speak dictatorially, and say this is base,\nor degraded, or ugly, I mean, only that I believe men of the longest\nexperience in the matter would either think it so, or would be prevented\nfrom thinking it so only by some morbid condition of their minds; and I\nbelieve that the reader, if he examine himself candidly, will usually\nagree in my statements.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.V. The subjects of ornament found in man's work may properly fall\ninto four heads: 1.Instruments of art, agriculture, and war; armor, and\ndress; 2.The custom of raising trophies on pillars, and of dedicating arms in\ntemples, appears to have first suggested the idea of employing them as\nthe subjects of sculptural ornament: thenceforward, this abuse has been\nchiefly characteristic of classical architecture, whether true or\nR", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Armor is a noble thing in its proper service and\nsubordination to the body; so is an animal's hide on its back; but a\nheap of cast skins, or of shed armor, is alike unworthy of all regard or\nimitation.We owe much true sublimity, and more of delightful\npicturesqueness, to the introduction of armor both in painting and\nsculpture: in poetry it is better still,--Homer's undressed Achilles is\nless grand than his crested and shielded Achilles, though Phidias would\nrather have had him naked; in all mediaeval painting, arms, like all\nother parts of costume, are treated with exquisite care and delight; in\nthe designs of Leonardo, Raffaelle, and Perugino, the armor sometimes\nbecomes almost too conspicuous from the rich and endless invention\nbestowed upon it; while Titian and Rubens seek in its flash what the\nMilanese and Perugian sought in its form, sometimes subordinating\nheroism to the light of the steel, while the great designers wearied\nthemselves in its elaborate fancy.But all this labor was given to the living, not the dead armor; to the\nshell with its animal in it, not the cast shell of the beach; and even\nso, it was introduced more sparingly by the good sculptors than the good\npainters; for the former felt, and with justice, that the painter had\nthe power of conquering the over prominence of costume by the expression\nand color of the countenance, and that by the darkness of the eye, and\nglow of the cheek, he could always conquer the gloom and the flash of\nthe mail; but they could hardly, by any boldness or energy of the marble\nfeatures, conquer the forwardness and conspicuousness of the sharp\narmorial forms.Their armed figures were therefore almost always\nsubordinate, their principal figures draped or naked, and their choice\nof subject was much influenced by this feeling of necessity.But the\nRenaissance sculptors displayed the love of a Camilla for the mere crest\nand plume.Paltry and false alike in every feeling of their narrowed\nminds, they attached themselves, not only to costume without the person,\nbut to the pettiest details of the costume itself.They could not\ndescribe Achilles, but they could describe his shield; a shield like\nthose of dedicated spoil, without a handle, never to be waved in the\nface of war.And then we have helmets and lances, banners and swords,\nsometimes with men to hold them, sometimes without; but always chiselled\nwith a tailor-like love of the chasing or the embroidery,--show helmets\nof the stage, no Vulcan work on them, no heavy hammer strokes, no Etna\nfire in the metal of them, nothing but pasteboard crests and high\nfeathers.And these, cast together in disorderly heaps, or grinning\nvacantly over keystones, form one of the leading decorations of\nRenaissance architecture, and that one of the best; for helmets and\nlances, however loosely laid, are better than violins, and pipes, and\nbooks of music, which were another of the Palladian and Sansovinian\nsources of ornament.Supported by ancient authority, the abuse soon\nbecame a matter of pride, and since it was easy to copy a heap of cast\nclothes, but difficult to manage an arranged design of human figures,\nthe indolence of architects came to the aid of their affectation, until\nby the moderns we find the practice carried out to its most interesting\nresults, and, as above noted, a large pair of boots occupying the\nprincipal place in the bas-reliefs on the base of the Colonne Vendome.A less offensive, because singularly grotesque, example of the\nabuse at its height, occurs in the Hotel des Invalides, where the dormer\nwindows are suits of armor down to the bottom of the corselet, crowned\nby the helmet, and with the window in the middle of the breast.Instruments of agriculture and the arts are of less frequent occurrence,\nexcept in hieroglyphics, and other work, where they are not employed as\nornaments, but represented for the sake of accurate knowledge, or as\nsymbols.Wherever they have purpose of this kind, they are of course\nperfectly right; but they are then part of the building's conversation,\nnot conducive to its beauty.The French have managed, with great\ndexterity, the representation of the machinery for the elevation of\ntheir Luxor obelisk, now sculptured on its base.I have already spoken of the error of introducing\ndrapery, as such, for ornament, in the \"Seven Lamps.\"I may here note a\ncurious instance of the abuse in the church of the Jesuiti at Venice\n(Renaissance).<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.On first entering you suppose that the church, being in a\npoor quarter of the city, has been somewhat meanly decorated by heavy\ngreen and white curtains of an ordinary upholsterer's pattern: on\nlooking closer, they are discovered to be of marble, with the green\npattern inlaid.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Another remarkable instance is in a piece of not\naltogether unworthy architecture at Paris (Rue Rivoli), where the\ncolumns are supposed to be decorated with images of handkerchiefs tied\nin a stout knot round the middle of them.This shrewd invention bids\nfair to become a new order.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Multitudes of massy curtains and various\nupholstery, more or less in imitation of that of the drawing-room, are\ncarved and gilt, in wood or stone, about the altars and other theatrical\nportions of Romanist churches; but from these coarse and senseless\nvulgarities we may well turn, in all haste, to note, with respect as\nwell as regret, one of the errors of the great school of Niccolo\nPisano,--an error so full of feeling as to be sometimes all but\nredeemed, and altogether forgiven,--the sculpture, namely, of curtains\naround the recumbent statues upon tombs, curtains which angels are\nrepresented as withdrawing, to gaze upon the faces of those who are at\nrest.For some time the idea was simply and slightly expressed, and\nthough there was always a painfulness in finding the shafts of stone,\nwhich were felt to be the real supporters of the canopy, represented as\nof yielding drapery, yet the beauty of the angelic figures, and the\ntenderness of the thought, disarmed all animadversion.But the scholars\nof the Pisani, as usual, caricatured when they were unable to invent;\nand the quiet curtained canopy became a huge marble tent, with a pole in\nthe centre of it.Thus vulgarised, the idea itself soon disappeared, to\nmake room for urns, torches, and weepers, and the other modern\nparaphernalia of the churchyard.I have allowed this kind of subject to form a\nseparate head, owing to the importance of rostra in Roman decoration,\nand to the continual occurrence of naval subjects in modern monumental\nbas-relief.Fergusson says, somewhat doubtfully, that he perceives a\n\"_kind_ of beauty\" in a ship: I say, without any manner of doubt, that a\nship is one of the loveliest things man ever made, and one of the\nnoblest; nor do I know any lines, out of divine work, so lovely as those\nof the head of a ship, or even as the sweep of the timbers of a small\nboat, not a race boat, a mere floating chisel, but a broad, strong, sea\nboat, able to breast a wave and break it: and yet, with all this beauty,\nships cannot be made subjects of sculpture.No one pauses in particular\ndelight beneath the pediments of the Admiralty; nor does scenery of\nshipping ever become prominent in bas-relief without destroying it:\nwitness the base of the Nelson pillar.It may be, and must be sometimes,\nintroduced in severe subordination to the figure subject, but just\nenough to indicate the scene; sketched in the lightest lines on the\nbackground; never with any attempt at realisation, never with any\nequality to the force of the figures, unless the whole purpose of the\nsubject be picturesque.I shall explain this exception presently, in\nspeaking of imitative architecture.There is one piece of a ship's fittings, however, which may\nbe thought to have obtained acceptance as a constant element of\narchitectural ornament,--the cable: it is not, however, the cable\nitself, but its abstract form, a group of twisted lines (which a cable\nonly exhibits in common with many natural objects), which is indeed\nbeautiful as an ornament.Make the resemblance complete, give to the\nstone the threads and character of the cable, and you may, perhaps,\nregard the sculpture with curiosity, but never more with admiration.Consider the effect of the base of the statue of King William IV.The erroneous use of armor, or dress, or\ninstruments, or shipping, as decorative subject, is almost exclusively\nconfined to bad architecture--Roman or Renaissance.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.But the false use of\narchitecture itself, as an ornament of architecture, is conspicuous even\nin the mediaeval work of the best times, and is a grievous fault in some\nof its noblest examples.It is, therefore, of great importance to note exactly at what point this\nabuse begins, and in what it consists.In all bas-relief, architecture may be introduced as an\nexplanation of the scene in which the figures act; but with more or less\nprominence in the _inverse ratio of the importance of the figures_.The metaphysical reason of this is, that where the figures are of great\nvalue and beauty, the mind is supposed to be engaged wholly with them;\nand it is an impertinence to disturb its contemplation of them by any\nminor features whatever.As the figures become of less value, and are\nregarded with less intensity, accessory subjects may be introduced, such\nas the thoughts may have leisure for.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.Thus, if the figures be as large as life, and complete statues, it is\ngross vulgarity to carve a temple above them, or distribute them over\nsculptured rocks, or lead them up steps into pyramids: I need hardly\ninstance Canova's works,[63] and the Dutch pulpit groups, with\nfishermen, boats, and nets, in the midst of church naves.If the figures be in bas-relief, though as large as life, the scene may\nbe explained by lightly traced outlines: this is admirably done in the\nNinevite marbles.If the figures be in bas-relief, or even alto-relievo, but less than\nlife, and if their purpose is rather to enrich a space and produce\npicturesque shadows, than to draw the thoughts entirely to themselves,\nthe scenery in which they act may become prominent.The most exquisite\nexamples of this treatment are the gates of Ghiberti.What would that\nMadonna of the Annunciation be, without the little shrine into which she\nshrinks back?But all mediaeval work is full of delightful examples of\nthe same kind of treatment: the gates of hell and of paradise are\nimportant pieces, both of explanation and effect, in all early\nrepresentations of the last judgment, or of the descent into Hades.Peter, and the crushing flat of the devil under his own\ndoor, when it is beaten in, would hardly be understood without the\nrespective gate-ways above.The best of all the later capitals of the\nDucal Palace of Venice depends for great part of its value on the\nrichness of a small campanile, which is pointed to proudly by a small\nemperor in a turned-up hat, who, the legend informs us, is \"Numa\nPompilio, imperador, edifichador di tempi e chiese.\"Shipping may be introduced, or rich fancy of vestments, crowns,\nand ornaments, exactly on the same conditions as architecture; and if\nthe reader will look back to my definition of the picturesque in the\n\"Seven Lamps,\" he will see why I said, above, that they might only be\nprominent when the purpose of the subject was partly picturesque; that\nis to say, when the mind is intended to derive part of its enjoyment\nfrom the parasitical qualities and accidents of the thing, not from the\nheart of the thing itself.And thus, while we must regret the flapping sails in the death of Nelson\nin Trafalgar Square, we may yet most heartily enjoy the sculpture of a\nstorm in one of the bas-reliefs of the tomb of St.Pietro Martire in the\nchurch of St.Eustorgio at Milan, where the grouping of the figures is\nmost fancifully complicated by the undercut cordage of the vessel.In all these instances, however, observe that the permission\nto represent the human work as an ornament, is conditional on its being\nnecessary to the representation of a scene, or explanation of an action.On no terms whatever could any such subject be independently admissible.Observe, therefore, the use of manufacture as ornament is--\n\n  1.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.With heroic figure sculpture, not admissible at all.With picturesque figure sculpture, admissible in the degree of its\n       picturesqueness.Without figure sculpture, not admissible at all.So also in painting: Michael Angelo, in the Sistine Chapel, would not\nhave willingly painted a dress of figured damask or of watered satin;\nhis was heroic painting, not admitting accessories.Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and Vandyck, would be very sorry to\npart with their figured stuffs and lustrous silks; and sorry, observe,\nexactly in the degree of their picturesque feeling.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.Should not _we_ also\nbe sorry to have Bishop Ambrose without his vest, in that picture of the\nNational Gallery?But I think Vandyck would not have liked, on the other hand, the vest\nwithout the bishop.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.I much doubt if Titian or Veronese would have\nenjoyed going into Waterloo House, and making studies of dresses upon\nthe counter.So, therefore, finally, neither architecture nor any other human\nwork is admissible as an ornament, except in subordination to figure\nsubject.And this law is grossly and painfully violated by those curious\nexamples of Gothic, both early and late, in the north, (but late, I\nthink, exclusively, in Italy,) in which the minor features of the\narchitecture were composed of _small models_ of the larger: examples\nwhich led the way to a series of abuses materially affecting the life,\nstrength, and nobleness of the Northern Gothic,--abuses which no\nNinevite, nor Egyptian, nor Greek, nor Byzantine, nor Italian of the\nearlier ages would have endured for an instant, and which strike me with\nrenewed surprise whenever I pass beneath a portal of thirteenth century\nNorthern Gothic, associated as they are with manifestations of exquisite\nfeeling and power in other directions.The porches of Bourges, Amiens,\nNotre Dame of Paris, and Notre Dame of Dijon, may be noted as\nconspicuous in error: small models of feudal towers with diminutive\nwindows and battlements, of cathedral spires with scaly pinnacles, mixed\nwith temple pediments and nondescript edifices of every kind, are\ncrowded together over the recess of the niche into a confused fool's cap\nfor the saint below.Italian Gothic is almost entirely free from the\ntaint of this barbarism until the Renaissance period, when it becomes\nrampant in the cathedral of Como and Certosa of Pavia; and at Venice we\nfind the Renaissance churches decorated with models of fortifications\nlike those in the Repository at Woolwich, or inlaid with mock arcades in\npseudo-perspective, copied from gardeners' paintings at the ends of\nconservatories.I conclude, then, with the reader's leave, that all ornament\nis base which takes for its subject human work, that it is utterly\nbase,--painful to every rightly-toned mind, without perhaps immediate\nsense of the reason, but for a reason palpable enough when we _do_ think\nof it.For to carve our own work, and set it up for admiration, is a\nmiserable self-complacency, a contentment in our own wretched doings,\nwhen we might have been looking at God's doings.And all noble ornament\nis the exact reverse of this.It is the expression of man's delight in\nGod's work.For observe, the function of ornament is to make you happy.Not in thinking of what you have done\nyourself; not in your own pride, not your own birth; not in your<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "You are to be made happy by ornaments; therefore they must be the\nexpression of all this.Not copies of your own handiwork; not boastings\nof your own grandeur; not heraldries; not king's arms, nor any\ncreature's arms, but God's arm, seen in His work.Not manifestation of\nyour delight in your own laws, or your own liberties, or your own\ninventions; but in divine laws, constant, daily, common laws;--not\nComposite laws, nor Doric laws, nor laws of the five orders, but of the\nTen Commandments.Then the proper material of ornament will be whatever God has\ncreated; and its proper treatment, that which seems in accordance with\nor symbolical of His laws.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.And, for material, we shall therefore have,\nfirst, the abstract lines which are most frequent in nature; and then,\nfrom lower to higher, the whole range of systematised inorganic and\norganic forms.We shall rapidly glance in order at their kinds; and,\nhowever absurd the elemental division of inorganic matter by the\nancients may seem to the modern chemist, it is one so grand and simple\nfor arrangements of external appearances, that I shall here follow it;\nnoticing first, after abstract lines, the imitable forms of the four\nelements, of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, and then those of animal\norganisms.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.It may be convenient to the reader to have the order stated\nin a clear succession at first, thus:--\n\n   1.It may be objected that clouds are a form of moisture, not of air.They\nare, however, a perfect expression of aerial states and currents, and\nmay sufficiently well stand for the element they move in.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.And I have put\nvegetation apparently somewhat out of its place, owing to its vast\nimportance as a means of decoration, and its constant association with\nbirds and men.I have not with lines named also shades\nand colors, for this evident reason, that there are no such things as\nabstract shadows, irrespective of the forms which exhibit them, and\ndistinguished in their own nature from each other; and that the\narrangement of shadows, in greater or less quantity, or in certain\nharmonical successions, is an affair of treatment, not of selection.And\nwhen we use abstract colors, we are in fact using a part of nature\nherself,--using a quality of her light, correspondent with that of the\nair, to carry sound; and the arrangement of color in harmonious masses\nis again a matter of treatment, not selection.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.Yet even in this separate\nart of coloring, as referred to architecture, it is very notable that\nthe best tints are always those of natural stones.These can hardly be\nwrong; I think I never yet saw an offensive introduction of the natural\ncolors of marble and precious stones, unless in small mosaics, and in\none or two glaring instances of the resolute determination to produce\nsomething ugly at any cost.On the other hand, I have most assuredly\nnever yet seen a painted building, ancient or modern, which seemed to me\nquite right.Our first constituents of ornament will therefore be abstract\nlines, that is to say, the most frequent contours of natural objects,\ntransferred to architectural forms when it is not right or possible to\nrender such forms distinctly imitative.For instance, the line or curve\nof the edge of a leaf may be accurately given to the edge of a stone,\nwithout rendering the stone in the least _like_ a leaf, or suggestive of\na leaf; and this the more fully, because the lines of nature are alike\nin all her works; simpler or richer in combination, but the same in\ncharacter; and when they are taken out of their combinations it is\nimpossible to say from which of her works they have been borrowed, their\nuniversal property being that of ever-varying curvature in the most\nsubtle and subdued transitions, with peculiar expressions of motion,\nelasticity, or dependence, which I have already insisted upon at some\nlength in the chapters on typical beauty in \"Modern Painters.\"But, that\nthe reader may here be able to compare them for himself as deduced from\ndifferent sources, I have drawn, as accurately as I can, on the opposite\nplate, some ten or eleven lines from natural forms of very different\nsubstances and scale: the first, _a b_, is in the original, I think, the\nmost beautiful simple curve I have ever seen in my life; it is a curve\nabout three quarters of a mile long, formed by the surface of a small\nglacier of the second order, on a spur of the Aiguille de Blaitiere\n(Chamouni).I have merely outlined the crags on the right of it, to show\ntheir sympathy and united action with the curve of the glacier, which is\nof course entirely dependent on their opposition to its descent;\nsoftened, however, into unity by the snow, which rarely melts on this\nhigh glacier surface.The line _d c_ is some mile and a half or two miles long; it is part of\nthe flank of the chain of the Dent d'Oche above the lake of Geneva, one\nor two of the lines of the higher and more distant ranges being given in\ncombination with it._h_ is a line about four feet long, a branch of spruce fir.I have taken\nthis tree because it is commonly supposed to be stiff and ungraceful;\nits outer sprays are, however, more noble in their sweep than almost any\nthat I know: but this fragment is seen at great disadvantage, because\nplaced upside down, in order that the reader may compare its curvatures\nwith _c d_, _e g_, and _i k_, which are all mountain lines; _e g_, about\nfive hundred feet of the southern edge of the Matterhorn; _i k_, the\nentire <DW72> of the Aiguille Bouchard, from its summit into the valley\nof Chamouni, a line some three miles long; _l m_ is the line of the side\nof a willow leaf traced by laying the leaf on the paper; _n o_, one of\nthe innumerable groups of curves at the lip of a paper Nautilus; _p_, a\nspiral, traced on the paper round a Serpula; _q r_, the leaf of the\nAlisma Plantago with its interior ribs, real size; _s t_, the side of a\nbay-leaf; _u w_, of a salvia leaf; and it is to be carefully noted that\nthese last curves, being never intended by nature to be seen singly, are\nmore heavy and less agreeable than any of the others which would be seen\nas independent lines.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.But all agree in their character of changeful\ncurvature, the mountain and glacier lines only excelling the rest in\ndelicacy and richness of transition.Why lines of this kind are beautiful, I endeavored to show in\nthe \"Modern Painters;\" but one point, there omitted, may be mentioned\nhere,--that almost all these lines are expressive of action of _force_\nof some kind, while the circle is a line of limitation or support.In\nleafage they mark the forces of its growth and expansion, but some among\nthe most beautiful of them are described by bodies variously in motion,\nor subjected to force; as by projectiles in the air, by the particles of\nwater in a gentle current, by planets in motion in an orbit, by their\nsatellites, if the actual path of the satellite in space be considered\ninstead of its relation to the planet; by boats, or birds, turning in\nthe water or air, by clouds in various action upon the wind, by sails in\nthe curvatures they assume under its force, and by thousands of other\nobjects moving or bearing force.In the Alisma leaf, _q r_, the lines\nthrough its body, which are of peculiar beauty, mark the different\nexpansions of its fibres, and are, I think, exactly the same as those\nwhich would be traced by the currents of a river entering a lake of the\nshape of the leaf, at the end where the stalk is, and passing out at its\npoint.Circular curves, on the contrary, are always, I think, curves of\nlimitation or support; that is to say, curves of perfect rest.The\ncylindrical curve round the stem of a plant binds its fibres together;\nwhile the _ascent_ of the stem is in lines of various curvature: so the\ncurve of the horizon and of the apparent heaven, of the rainbow, etc.:\nand though the reader might imagine that the circular orbit of any\nmoving body, or the curve described by a sling, was a curve of motion,\nhe should observe that the circular character is given to the curve not\nby the motion, but by the confinement: the circle is the consequence not\nof the energy of the body, but of its being forbidden to leave the\ncentre; and whenever the whirling or circular motion can be fully\nimpressed on it we obtain instant balance and rest with respect to the\ncentre of the circle.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Hence the peculiar fitness of the circular curve as a sign of rest, and\nsecurity of support, in arches; while the other curves, belonging\nespecially to action, are to be used in the more active architectural\nfeatures--the hand and foot (the capital and base), and in all minor\nornaments; more freely in proportion to their independence of structural\nconditions.We need not, however, hope to be able to imitate, in general\nwork, any of the subtly combined curvatures of nature's highest\ndesigning: on the contrary, their extreme refinement renders them unfit\nfor coarse service or material.Lines which are lovely in the pearly\nfilm of the Nautilus shell, are lost in the grey roughness of stone; and\nthose which are sublime in the blue of far away hills, are weak in the\nsubstance of incumbent marble.Of all the graceful lines assembled on\nPlate VII., we shall do well to be content with two of the simplest.We\nshall take one mountain line (_e g_) and one leaf line (_u w_), or\nrather fragments of them, for we shall perhaps not want them all.I will\nmark off from _u w_ the little bit _x y_, and from _e g_ the piece _e\nf_; both which appear to me likely to be serviceable: and if hereafter\nwe need the help of any abstract lines, we will see what we can do with\nthese only.It may be asked why I do not\nsay rocks or mountains?Simply, because the nobility of these depends,\nfirst, on their scale, and, secondly, on accident.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.Their scale cannot be\nrepresented, nor their accident systematised.No sculptor can in the\nleast imitate the peculiar character of accidental fracture: he can obey\nor exhibit the laws of nature, but he cannot copy the felicity of her\nfancies, nor follow the steps of her fury.The very glory of a mountain\nis in the revolutions which raised it into power, and the forces which\nare striking it into ruin.But we want no cold and careful imitation of\ncatastrophe; no calculated mockery of convulsion; no delicate\nrecommendation of ruin.We are to follow the labor of Nature, but not\nher disturbance; to imitate what she has deliberately ordained,[64] not\nwhat she has violently suffered, or strangely permitted.The only uses,\ntherefore, of rock form which are wise in the architect, are its actual\nintroduction (by leaving untouched such blocks as are meant for rough\nservice), and that noble use of the general examples of mountain\nstructure of which I have often heretofore spoken.Imitations of rock\nform have, for the most part, been confined to periods of degraded\nfeeling and to architectural toys or pieces of dramatic effect,--the\nCalvaries and holy sepulchres of Romanism, or the grottoes and fountains\nof English gardens.They were, however, not unfrequent in mediaeval\nbas-reliefs; very curiously and elaborately treated by Ghiberti on the\ndoors of Florence, and in religious sculpture necessarily introduced\nwherever the life of the anchorite was to be expressed.They were rarely\nintroduced as of ornamental character, but for particular service and\nexpression; we shall see an interesting example in the Ducal Palace at\nVenice.But against crystalline form, which is the completely\nsystematised natural structure of the earth, none of these objections\nhold good, and, accordingly, it is an endless element of decoration,\nwhere higher conditions of structure cannot be represented.The\nfour-sided pyramid, perhaps the most frequent of all natural crystals,\nis called in architecture a dogtooth; its use is quite limitless, and\nalways beautiful: the cube and rhomb are almost equally frequent in\nchequers and dentils: and all mouldings of the middle Gothic are little\nmore than representations of the canaliculated crystals of the beryl,\nand such other minerals:\n\nSec.I do not suppose a single hint was ever actually\ntaken from mineral form; not even by the Arabs in their stalactite\npendants and vaults: all that I mean to allege is, that beautiful\nornament, wherever found, or however invented, is always either an\nintentional or unintentional copy of some constant natural form; and\nthat in this particular instance, the pleasure we have in these\ngeometrical figures of our own invention, is dependent for all its\nacuteness on the natural tendency impressed on us by our Creator to love\nthe forms into which the earth He gave us to tread, and out of which He\nformed our bodies, knit itself as it was separated from the deep.The reasons which prevent rocks from being used for ornament repress\nstill more forcibly the portraiture of the sea.Yet the constant\nnecessity of introducing some representation of water in order to\nexplain the scene of events, or as a sacred symbol, has forced the\nsculptors of all ages to the invention of some type or letter for it, if\nnot an actual imitation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.We find every degree of conventionalism or of\nnaturalism in these types, the earlier being, for the most part,\nthoughtful symbols; the latter, awkward attempts at portraiture.[65] The\nmost conventional of all types is the Egyptian zigzag, preserved in the\nastronomical sign of Aquarius; but every nation, with any capacities of\nthought, has given, in some of its work, the same great definition of\nopen water, as \"an undulatory thing with fish in it.\"I say _open_\nwater, because inland nations have a totally different conception of the\nelement.Imagine for an instant the different feelings of an husbandman\nwhose hut is built by the Rhine or the Po, and who sees, day by day,\nthe same giddy succession of silent power, the same opaque, thick,\nwhirling, irresistible labyrinth of rushing lines and twisted eddies,\ncoiling themselves into serpentine race by the reedy banks, in omne\nvolubilis aevum,--and the image of the sea in the mind of the fisher upon\nthe rocks of Ithaca, or by the Straits of Sicily, who sees how, day by\nday, the morning winds come coursing to the shore, every breath of them\nwith a green wave rearing before it; clear, crisp, ringing, merry-minded\nwaves, that fall over and over each other, laughing like children as\nthey near the beach, and at last clash themselves all into dust of\ncrystal over the dazzling sweeps of sand.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Fancy the difference of the\nimage of water in those two minds, and then compare the sculpture of the\ncoiling eddies of the Tigris and its reedy branches in those slabs of\nNineveh, with the crested curls of the Greek sea on the coins of\nCamerina or Tarentum.But both agree in the undulatory lines, either of\nthe currents or the surface, and in the introduction of fish as\nexplanatory of the meaning of those lines (so also the Egyptians in\ntheir frescoes, with most elaborate realisation of the fish).There is a\nvery curious instance on a Greek mirror in the British Museum,\nrepresenting Orion on the Sea; and multitudes of examples with dolphins\non the Greek vases: the type is preserved without alteration in mediaeval\npainting and sculpture.The sea in that Greek mirror (at least 400\nB.C.), in the mosaics of Torcello and St.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Frediano at Lucca, on the gate of the fortress of St.Michael's Mount in\nNormandy, on the Bayeux tapestry, and on the capitals of the Ducal\nPalace at Venice (under Arion on his Dolphin),", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "Giotto, in the frescoes of Avignon, has,\nwith his usual strong feeling for naturalism, given the best example I\nremember, in painting, of the unity of the conventional system with\ndirect imitation, and that both in sea and river; giving in pure blue\ncolor the coiling whirlpool of the stream, and the curled crest of the\nbreaker.But in all early sculptural examples, both imitation and\ndecorative effect are subordinate to easily understood symbolical\nlanguage; the undulatory lines are often valuable as an enrichment of\nsurface, but are rarely of any studied gracefulness.One of the best\nexamples I know of their expressive arrangement is around some figures\nin a spandril at Bourges, representing figures sinking in deep sea (the\ndeluge): the waved lines yield beneath the bodies and wildly lave the\nedge of the moulding, two birds, as if to mark the reverse of all order\nof nature, lowest of all sunk in the depth of them.In later times of\ndebasement, water began to be represented with its waves, foam, etc., as\non the Vendramin tomb at Venice, above cited; but even there, without\nany definite ornamental purpose, the sculptor meant partly to explain a\nstory, partly to display dexterity of chiselling, but not to produce\nbeautiful forms pleasant to the eye.The imitation is vapid and joyless,\nand it has often been matter of surprise to me that sculptors, so fond\nof exhibiting their skill, should have suffered this imitation to fall\nso short, and remain so cold,--should not have taken more pains to curl\nthe waves clearly, to edge them sharply, and to express, by drill-holes\nor other artifices, the character of foam.I think in one of the Antwerp\nchurches something of this kind is done in wood, but in general it is\nrare.If neither the sea nor\nthe rock can be imagined, still less the devouring fire.It has been\nsymbolised by radiation both in painting and sculpture, for the most\npart in the latter very unsuccessfully.It was suggested to me, not long\nago,[66] that zigzag decorations of Norman architects were typical of\nlight springing from the half-set orb of the sun; the resemblance to the\nordinary sun type is indeed remarkable, but I believe accidental.I\nshall give you, in my large plates, two curious instances of radiation\nin brick ornament above arches, but I think these also without any very\nluminous intention.It must be confessed that Dick and Tom were much disconcerted.The two rowboats were now less than fifty feet apart, and any kind\nof a shot from the weapon was likely to prove more or less\ndangerous.Baxter's eyes gleamed with the hatred of an angry\nsnake ready to strike.\"You think you are smart, you Rover boys,\" said the bully, after\nan awkward pause all around.\"You think you did a big thing in\nrescuing Dora Stanhope and in putting me and my father and Buddy\nGirk in prison.But let me tell you that this game hasn't come to\nan end yet, and some day we intend to square accounts.\"\"There is no use in wasting breath in this fashion, Baxter,\"\nreturned Dick, as calmly as he could.\"We are two to one, and the\nbest thing to do is for you to submit.If you fire on us, we may\ndo a little shooting on our own account.\"Do you imagine you can scare me in that fashion?You\nhaven't any pistol, and I know it.If you had you would have\ndrawn the weapon long ago.\"\"Don't be too sure,\" he said steadily,\nas the boats drifted still closer together.\"The minute I heard\nyou had escaped from jail I went and bought a pistol in\nCedarville.\"This was the strict truth, but Dick did not add that\nthe weapon lay at that moment safe in the bottom of his trunk at\nthe Hall.\"Got afraid I'd come around, eh?\"Now will you--\"\n\nDick did not have time to finish, for, lowering the front end of\nthe pistol, Dan Baxter pulled the trigger twice and two reports\nrang out in quick succession.One bullet buried itself in the\nseat beside Tom, while the second plowed its way through the\nbottom, near the stern.cried Dick, and in his excitement hurled his oar at\nDan Baxter, hitting the fellow across the fact with such force\nthat the bully's nose began to bleed.The shock made Baxter lose\nhis hold on the pistol and it went over the side of his craft and\nsank immediately to the bottom of the lake.muttered Tom, as he gazed at the\nhole through the seat.\"A little closer and I would have got it\nin the stomach.\"A yell now came from Sam, and a shriek from the girls, all of whom\nhad heard the pistol shots.They were too far away to see the\nresult of the shooting and feared both Tom and Dick had been\nkilled or wounded.As quickly as he could recover from the blow of the oar, Dan\nBaxter picked up his own blades, and without paying attention to\nthe blood which was flowing from his nose, began once again to\npull for the shore.shouted Dick, and then his face\nfell.\"Confound it, I've thrown away my oar!And\nhe pointed some distance to their left.\"Look at that hole in\nthe bottom, made by that pistol shot.The water is coming in just\nas fast as it can.\"There was small need to call attention to it, for the water in the\nbottom of the boat was already an inch deep.Dick started in\nperplexity, then, struck by a sudden idea, drew a lead pencil from\nhis pocket and rammed it into the opening.It fitted very well,\nand the water ceased, to come in.\"Now we'll have to bail out and pick up that other oar,\" said Tom.\"It was foolish to throw it away, Dick.\"Paddle over, and I'll pick it up.\"Tom did so, and the blade was\nspeedily recovered.But Dan Baxter had made good use of the precious moments lost by\nthe Rover boys, and hardly were the latter into shape for rowing\nonce more than they saw the bully beach his craft and leap out on\nthe shore.\"I told you\nthat you couldn't catch me.The next time we meet I'll make you\nsorry that you ever followed me,\" and he started to run off with\nall possible speed.Tom and Dick were too chagrined to answer him, and pulled forward\nto the shore in silence.They ran the craft into some bushes and\ntied up, and then started after Baxter, who was now making for the\nwoods south of the village of Nelson.When the highway skirting this portion of Cayuga Lake was gained\nDan Baxter was a good five hundred feet ahead of them.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.A turn in\nthe road soon hid him from view.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.Gaining the bend they discovered\nthat he had disappeared from view altogether.\"He has taken to the woods,\" sighed Dick.\"If that is so we may as well give the hunt up,\" answered his\nbrother.\"It would be worse than looking for a pin in a haystack,\nfor we wouldn't know what direction he had taken.\"\"I wish I had a bloodhound with which to trail him.He ought to\nbe run down, Tom.\"\"Well, let us notify some of the people living near and see what\ncan be done.\"They ran on to the spot where they supposed Baxter had left the\nhighway.On both sides were dense thickets of cedars with heavy\nunderbrush.All in all, the locality formed an ideal hiding\nplace.Night was coming on by the time they gained the nearest farmhouse.Here they found three men, to whom they explained the situation.\"If he went into the woods it would be a hard job to trail him,\"\nwas the comment from Farmer Mason.\"If he ain't careful he'll\nlose himself so completely he'll never git out, b'gosh!\"\"Well, I don't know but what that would suit me,\" responded Tom\ndryly.The search was begun, and several others joined in.It lasted\nuntil night was fairly upon the party and was then given up in\ndisgust.\"But we ought to notify the authorities,\" said Tom.\"They will\nprobably put a detective on his track.\"\"Yes; but a detective can't do any more than we can, up in this\nwild locality.\"\"Well, we can send the police a telegram from Cedarville.\"This was done, and the Rover boys returned to Putnam Hall by way\nof the side road leaving past the homes of the Stanhopes and the\nLanings.They found Sam and the girls very anxious concerning\ntheir welfare.\"We were afraid you had been shot,\" said Dora.\"But it's too bad that Baxter got away.I\nwonder where he will turn up next.\"They all wondered, but could not even venture an answer.Soon the\nboys left the girls and hurried to the academy, where their story,\nhad to be told over again.Captain Putnam looked exceedingly\ngrave over the narrative.\"You must be careful in the future, lads,\" he said.\"Remember,\nyou are in my care here.I do not know what your uncle would say\nif anything should happen to you.\"\"We will be on our guard in the future,\" answered Dick.\"But I am\nawfully sorry we didn't catch him.\"\"So am I.  But perhaps the authorities will have better luck,\" and\nthere the talk came to an end, and the boys retired for the night.CHAPTER V\n\nFUN AND AN EXPLOSION\n\n\nSeveral days slipped by, and the boys waited anxiously for some\nnews from the authorities.But none came, and they rightfully\nsurmised that, for the time being, Dan Baxter had made good his\nescape.On account of the disastrous ending to the kite-flying match, many\nhad supposed that the feast in Dormitory No.6 was not to come\noff, but Sam, Tom, Frank, and several others got their heads\ntogether and prepared for a \"layout\" for the following Wednesday,\nwhich would be Dick's birthday.\"We'll give him a surprise,\" said Sam, and so it was agreed.Passing around the hat netted exactly three dollars and a quarter,\nand Tom, Sam, and Fred Garrison were delegated to purchase the\ncandies, cake, and ice cream which were to constitute the spread.\"We'll do the thing up brown,\" said Sam.\"We must strike higher than that feast we had, last year.\"came from Tom, \"Oh dear, do you remember how we\nserved Mumps that night!\"and he set up a roar over the\nremembrance of the scene.Hans Mueller had become one of the occupants of the dormitory, and\nhe was as much, interested as anybody in the preparations for the\nspread.\"I like to have von feast\ntwist a veek, ha I ha!\"He's a jolly dog,\" said Tom to Frank.\"But, say, I've been thinking of having some fun with him before\nthis spread comes off.\"\"Let me in on the ground floor,\" pleaded Frank, who always wok a\ngreat interest in Tom's jokes.\"That you loan me that masquerade suit you have in your trunk.The one you used at that New Year's dance at home.\"\"Hullo, I reckon I smell a mouse!\"\"I\nheard you giving Hans that yarn about us training to fight\nIndians.\"'\"I did indeed; and I heard Hans say that he wanted nothing to do\nwith the Indians.\"\"Well, he's going to have something to do with at least one\nIndian,\" grinned Tom.\"Yes; if you'll fix it so that I can see the sport.\"\"All of the crowd can see it, if they don't leak about it,\"\nreturned the fun-loving Rover.Tom soon had the masquerade suit in his possession and also, some\nface paints which Frank had saved from the New Year's dance mentioned.Shortly afterward Tom joined the crowd in the gymnasium, where\nHans Mueller was trying to do some vaulting over the bars.\"I dink I could chump dem sticks of I vos taller,\" the German\nyouth was saying.\"Or the sticks were lower,\" replied Tom, with a wink at the crowd.\"That's right, Hans, you had better learn how to jump now, and to\nrun, too.\"\"They say a band of them are in the woods around here,\" answered\nTom.\"If you go out you want to be careful or they may scalp\nyou.\"\"Cracious, Rofer, ton't say dot!\"\"Vot is\ndem Indians doing here annavay?\"\"They came in East to hunt up some buffalo that got away.They\nhad something like half a million in a corral, and about two\nthousand got away from them.\"This preposterous announcement was taken by Hans Mueller in all\nseriousness, and he asked Tom all sorts of ridiculous questions\nabout the savage red men, whom he supposed as wild and wily as\nthose of generations ago.\"No, I ton't vonts to meet any of dem,\" he said at last.\"Da vos\nvon pad lot alretty!\"\"That's right, Hans, you give them a wide berth,\" said Tom, and\nwalked away.Later on Tom persuaded Dick to ask Hans if he would not walk down\nto Cedarville for him, to buy him a baseball.Eager to be\naccommodating, the German youth received the necessary permission\nto leave the academy acres and hurried off at the full speed of\nhis sturdy legs.cried Tom, and ran off for the Indian suit and\nthe face paints.These he took down to the bam and set to work to\ntransform himself into a wild-looking red man.grinned Peleg Snuggers, who stood watching\nhim.\"We never had such a lad as you before Master Thomas.\"\"Thanks, Peleg, and perhaps you'll never have one like me again--and\nthen you'll be dreadfully sorry.\"\"Oh, I never say nuthin, Master Thomas; you know that,\" returned\nthe man-of-all-work.A number of the other pupils had been let into the secret, and,\nled by Dick, they ran off to the woods lining the Cedarville road.Tom came after them, skulking along that nobody driving by might\ncatch sight of him.Not quite an hour later Hans Mueller was heard coming back.The\nGerman boy was humming to himself and at the same time throwing up\nthe new ball he had purchased for Dick.thundered out Tom, as he leaped from behind a big\ntree.\"Dutcha boy heap big scalp-me take um!And he\ndanced up to Hans, flourishing a big tin knife as he did so.The\nmasquerade was a perfect one, and he looked like an Indian who had\njust stepped forth from some Wild West show.screamed Hans, as he stopped short and grew white.\"It's dem Indians come to take mine hair!Oh, please, Mister\nIndian, ton't vos touch me!\"\"Dutcha boy heap nice hair,\" continued Tom, drawing nearer.\"Maka\nnice door-mat for Big Wolf.\"No, no; ton't vos touch mine hair-it vos all der hair I vos got!\"\"Please, Mister Indian mans, let me go!\"bellowed Tom, drawing forth a\nrusty pistol he had picked up in the barn.This rusty pistol had\ndone lots of duty at fun-making before.Then he fell on his knees\nin despair.Tom could scarcely keep from laughing at the sight, and a snicker\nor two could be heard coming from where Frank, Dick, and the\nothers were concealed behind the bushes.But the German youth was\ntoo terrorized to notice anything but that awful red man before\nhim, with his hideous war-paint of blue and yellow.\"Dutcha boy dance for Big Wolf,\" went on Tom.And the fun-loving Rover set the pace in a mad,\ncaper that would have done credit to a Zulu.faltered Hans, and then, thinking he might\nappease the wrath of his unexpected enemy he began to caper about\nin a clumsy fashion which was comical in the extreme.\"Dutcha boy take the cake for\nflingin' hees boots.Faster, faster, or Big Wolf shoot, bang!\"\"No, no; I vos dance so hard as I can!\"panted Hans, and renewed\nhis exertions until Tom could keep in no longer, and set up such a\nlaugh as had not been heard around the Hall for many a day.It is\nneedless to add that the other boys joined in, still, however,\nkeeping out of sight.\"You\nought to join the buck-and-wing dancers in a minstrel company.\"began the German boy in bewilderment.\"To be sure I am; I'm Big Wolf, the Head Dancing Master of the\nTuscaroras, Hans, dear boy.Don't you think I'm a stunner.\"\"You vos Tom Rofer, made up,\" growled Hans in sudden and deep\ndisgust.\"Vot for you vos blay me such a drick as dis, hey?\"\"I", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "\"I mean to stir up your ideas--put something new into your\nhead.\"\"Den vot you say you vos put somedings new py him, hey?\"\"I mean to make you sharper-put you on your mettle.\"\"I ton't understand,\" stammered the German youth hopelessly.\"That's so, and you won't in a thousand years, Hans.But you are\nthe right sort, any way.\"\"I dink  I blay me Indian mineselluf some tay,\" mused Hans.\"Dot\nvos lots of fun to make me tance, vosn't it?Look out, or it may go off,\" added Tom, as he\nheld out the weapons, thinking Hans would draw back in alarm.Instead, however, the German boy took the pistol and of a sudden\npointed it at Tom's head.\"Tance, or I vos shoot you\nfull of holes!\"\"Hi, Tom; he's got the best of you now!\"\"You can't make me dance, Hans,\" returned Tom.\"That old rusty\niron hasn't been loaded for years.\"\"Pull the trigger and see,\" answered Tom coolly.He had scarcely spoken when Hans Mueller did as advised.A\ntremendous report followed, and when the smoke cleared away the\nboys in the bushes were horrified to see that the rusty pistol had\nbeen shattered into a thousand pieces and that both Tom and Hans\nlay on their backs in the road, their faces covered with blood.CHAPTER VI\n\nTHE STRANGE FIGURE IN THE HALLWAY\n\n\nAt the fearful outcome of the joke Tom had been perpetrating the\nboys concealed in the bushes were almost struck dumb, and for\nseveral seconds nobody could speak or move.\"Oh, Heavens, Tom is killed!\"burst out Dick, who was the first to\nfind his voice.He ran forth as speedily as possible, and one\nafter another the other cadets followed.Tom lay as quiet as death, with his eyes closed and the blood\ntrickling over his temple and left cheek.Quickly Dick knelt by\nhis side and felt of his heart.But no answer came back, and Sam raced off to get some water,\nwhich he brought in a tin can he had discovered lying handy.The\nwater was dashed over Toni's face, and presently he gave a little\ngasp.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.he murmured, and then tried to sit up,\nbut for the minute the effort was a failure.\"A piece must have hit you on\nthe head,\" and he pointed at a nasty scalp wound from which the\nflow of blood emanated.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.As well as it could be done, Frank and Dick bound up Tom's head\nwith a handkerchief, and presently the fun-loving lad declared\nhimself about as well as ever, \"Only a bit light-headed,\" as he\nadded.In the meantime the others had given their attention to Hans, who\nhad been struck both in the scalp and in the shoulder.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.It was a\ngood quarter of an hour before the German youth came around, and\nthen he felt so weak that the boys had to assist him back to the\nacademy.\"Honestly, I thought the pistol was empty,\" said Tom, on the\nreturn to the Hall.\"Why, I think I've pulled that trigger a\ndozen times.\"\"Don't mention it,\" said Frank with a shiver.\"Why, only last\nweek I pointed the thing at Peleg Snuggers and played at firing\nit.Supposing it had gone off and killed somebody?\"\"Dot vos almost as pad as von Indian's schalping,\" put in Hans\nfaintly.\"I dink, Tom, you vos play no more such dricks, hey?\"\"No, I've had enough,\" replied Tom very soberly.\"If you had been\nkilled or seriously hurt I would never have forgiven myself.\"And\nit may be added here that for some time after this event\nfun-making and Tom were strangers to each other.At the proper time the feast which had been planned came off, and\nproved to be an event not readily forgotten.It was no easy\nmatter to obtain the good things required, and the boys ran the\nrisk of being discovered by George Strong and punished; but by\nmidnight everything was ready, and soon eating was \"in full\nblast,\" to use Sam's way of expressing it.A few of the boys from the other dormitories had been invited, and\nthe boys took turns in standing out in the hall on guard.Strong may come in, and I won't be\nable to play nightmare again, as I did last year.\"\"Say, but that was a prime joke,\" laughed Frank.\"I'll never forget the orange flavored\nwith kerosene,\" and a general laugh followed.Somebody had spoken of inviting Jim Caven to the feast, but no one\ncared particularly for the fellow, and he had been left out.\"Perhaps he'll tell on us,\" suggested Larry, but Frank shook his\nhead.\"He hasn't got backbone enough to do it.He's a worse coward than\nMumps was.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.Soon it came time for Sam to do his turn at guarding, and stuffing\na big bit of candy in his mouth, the youngest Rover stepped out\ninto the dimly lit hallway and sat down on a low stool which one\nof the guards had placed there.For ten or fifteen minutes nothing occurred to disturb Sam, and he\nwas just beginning to think that watching was all nonsense when he\nsaw a dark figure creeping along the wall at the extreme lower end\nof the hallway, where it made a turn toward the back stairs.He continued to watch the figure, and now saw that it was dressed\nin a black suit and had what looked like a shawl over its head.\"What can that man or boy be up\nto?\"Presently the figure turned and entered one of the lower\ndormitories, closing the door gently behind it.Then it came out\nagain and made swiftly for the rear of the upper hallway.By\nthis time Sam was more curious than ever, and as the figure\ndisappeared around the bend by the back stairs he followed on\ntiptoes.But as what light there was came from the front, the rear was very\ndark, and the youth could see little or nothing.He heard a door\nclose and the lock click, but whether or not it was upstairs or\ndown he could not tell.For several minutes he remained in the rear hallway, and then he\nwent back to his post.Soon Tom came out to relieve him, and Sam\nre-entered the dormitory and told his story to the others.\"That's certainly odd,\" was Dick's comment\n\n\"Was it a man or a boy, Sam?\"If it wasn't a man it was a pretty big\nboy.\"\"Perhaps we ought to report the matter to Captain Putnam,\"\nsuggested Frank.\"That person may have been around the hallways\nfor no good purpose.\"perhaps it was somebody who was trying to spy on us,\"\nput in Fred.\"If we tell the captain we will only be exposing\nourselves, and I guess you all know what that means.\"\"It means half-holidays cut off for a month,\" said Dick.\"Besser you vait und see vot comes of dis,\" said Hans, and after a\nlittle more talk this idea prevailed, and then the boys went in to\nclear up what was left of the feast.Everything was gone but a\nlittle ice-cream, and it did not take long to dispose of this.Sam was bound to have some fun, and instead of eating his last\nmouthful of cream he awaited a favorable opportunity and dropped\nit down inside of Fred's collar.That's worse than a chunk of\nice!\"Go down and sit on the kitchen stove,\" suggested Dick.I'll sit on Sam's head if I get the chance!\"roared Fred, and made a rush for Sam.A scuffle ensued, which\ncame to a sudden end as both sent a washstand over with a loud\ncrash.\"That's noise enough to wake\nthe dead.\"\"Do you want to bring the captain down on us at the last minute?\"\"Clear up that muss, both of you,\" said Dick to Sam and Fred.It was Sam's fault--he started the racket.\"I reckon we had best dust,\" said one of the boys from another\ndormitory.\"I hear somebody coming already,\"\nand in a twinkle the outsiders ran for their various quarters,\nleaving the occupants of Dormitory No.6 to fix up matters as best\nthey could.It was no easy job to straighten out the washstand, clear up the\ngeneral muss, and disrobe.But the boys were on their mettle, and\nin less than two minutes the light was out and all were under the\ncovers, although, to be sure, Sam had his shoes still on and Tom\nwas entirely clothed.\"Boys, what is the row up here?\"The call came from Captain\nPutnam himself.He was ascending the front stairs, lamp in hand,\nand attired in a long dressing gown.As no one answered, he paused in the upper hallway and asked the\nquestion again.Then he looked into one dormitory after another.Well, see that you don't wake up again as soon\nas my back is turned,\" he went on, and soon after walked below\nagain, a faint smile on his features.He knew that boys were\nbound to be more or less mischievous, no matter how strict his\nregulations.\"I'll tell you what, the captain's a brick!\"whispered Tom, as he\nbegan to disrobe noiselessly.\"You wouldn't catch old Crabtree\nacting that way.He'd have bad every cadet out of bed and sent\nhalf a dozen of us down to the guard-room.\"\"I guess the captain remembers when he was a cadet himself,\"\nremarked Dick.\"I've heard that they cut up some high pranks at\nWest Point.\"\"George Strong would be just as kind,\" came from Tom.\"But say, I\nam growing awfully tired.\"\"So am I,\" came from several others,\n\nThen the good-night word was passed, and soon all of the cadets\nwere sound asleep, never dreaming of the surprise which awaited\nthem in the morning.\"Boys, I've had my trunk looted!\"\"And I've had my trousers' pockets picked!\"\"And the half-dollar I left on the bureau is gone!\"Such were some of the excited exclamations which the Rover boys\nheard when they went downstairs the next morning.The speakers\nwere the youths who occupied Dormitories Numbers 3 and 4, at the\nrear of the main upper hall.An inquiry among the lads elicited\nthe information that everybody had suffered excepting one boy, who\nsaid he had not had any money on hand.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.\"I spent my last cent for the spread,\" he grinned.The news of the robberies created a profound sensation throughout\nPutnam Hall, and both Captain Putnam and George Strong were very\nmuch disturbed.\"We never had such a thing occur before,\" said the captain, and he\nordered a strict investigation.All told, something like thirty-two dollars were missing, and also\na gold watch, a silver watch, and several shirt-studs of more or\nless value.Among the shirt-studs was one set with a ruby\nbelonging to a cadet named Weeks.The robbery had\nbeen committed during the night, while the owners of the money and\nthe various articles slept.\"I must get at the bottom of this affair,\" said Captain Putnam.He talked to all of those who had lost anything and promised to\nmake the matter good.Then he asked each if he had any suspicions\nregarding the thief or thieves.No one had, and for the time\nbeing it looked as if the case must fall to the ground.Those who had been at the feast hardly knew what to say or to do.Should they tell the captain of the strange figure Sam had seen in\nthe hallway?\"I'll tell him, and shoulder the blame, if you fellows are\nwilling,\" said Sam, after a long discussion.\"Fun is one thing,\nand shielding a thief is another.\"\"You do not know that that\nperson, was the thief.\"\"More than likely he was,\" came from Dick.\"If you tell Captain\nPutnam you'll simply get us all into trouble.\"\"I vote that Sam makes a clean breast of it,\" said Frank, and\nLarry said the same.This was just before dinner, and immediately\nafter the midday meal had been finished the youngest Rover went up\nto the master of the Hall and touched him on the arm.\"I would like to speak to you in private and at once, Captain\nPutnam,\" he said.\"Very well, Rover; come with me,\" was the reply, and Captain\nPutnam led the way to his private office.\"I suppose I should have spoken of this before,\" said Sam, when\nthe two were seated.\"But I didn't want to get the others into\ntrouble.As it is, Captain Putnam, I want to take the entire blame\non my own shoulders.\"\"Of what I am going to tell you about.We voted to tell you, but\nI don't want to be a tattle-tale and get the others into trouble\nalong with me.\"\"I will hear what you have to say,\" returned the master of the Hall\nbriefly.\"Well, sir, you know it was Dick's birthday yesterday, and we boys\nthought we would celebrate a bit.So we had a little blow-out in\nour room.\"\"Was that the noise I heard last night?\"\"The noise you heard was from our room, yes.But that isn't what\nI was getting at,\" stammered Sam.\"We set a guard out in the\nhallway to keep watch.\"\"I was out in the hall part of the time, and I saw a dark figure\nin the rear hallway prowling around in a most suspicious manner.3 and then came out and disappeared\ntoward the back stairs.\"\"A man, sir, or else a big boy.He had something like a shawl\nover his shoulders and was dressed in black or dark-brown.\"\"You saw him go in and come out of one of the sleeping rooms?\"\"He either went down the stairs or else into one of the back\nrooms.I walked back after a minute or two, but I didn't see\nanything more of him, although I heard a door close and heard a\nkey turn in a lock.\"\"Was this before I came up or after?\"We went to sleep right after you came up.\"And now Captain Putnam prepared to\nwrite down the names.\"Oh, sir; I hope you won't--won't--\"\n\n\"I'll have to ask you for the names, Samuel.I want to know who\nwas on foot last night as well as who was robbed.\"\"Surely you don't think any of us was guilty?\"\"I--I think I'll have to refuse to give them, Captain Putnam.\"\"Of course all the boys who sleep in your dormitory were present?\"\"I said I would take this all on my own shoulders, Captain Putnam.Of course, you know I wouldn't have confessed at all; but I don't\nwish to give that thief any advantage.\"\"Perhaps the person wasn't a thief at all, only some other cadet\nspying upon you.\"Hardly knowing whether or not he was doing right, Sam mentioned\nall of the cadets who had taken part in the feast.This list\nCaptain Putnam compared with another containing the names of those\nwho had been robbed.\"I'll have the whole, school in\nthis before I finish.\"The youth wondered what was coming\nnext, when there was a sudden knock on the door.\"Come in,\" said\nCaptain Putnam, and one of the little boys entered with a letter\nin his hand.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Strong sent me with this,\" said the young cadet.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.\"He just\nfound it on the desk in the main recitation room.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.\"All right, Powers; thank you,\" answered the captain, and took the\nletter.The letter was encased in a dirty, envelope on which was printed\nin a big hand, in lead pencil:\n\n\"CAPT.Taking up a steel blade, the master of the Hall cut open the\nenvelope and took out the slip of paper it contained.Then he crushed the paper in his\nhand and looked sharply at Sam.\"Samuel, was the party you saw in the hall-way tall and slim?\"\"No; it was too dark for that, and, besides, he had that shawl, or\nwhatever it was, pretty well up around him.\"\"By the way, you of course know Alexander Pop, our \nwaiter.\"Everybody knows Aleck, and we have had lots of\nfun with him, at one time or another.But you surely don't\nsuspect him, do you?\"It contains but two lines, and you can read it\nfor yourself,\" and the captain handed over the communication,\nwhich ran as follows:\n\n\"Alexander Pop stole that money and the other things.\"That's a mighty queer letter for anybody to write,\" murmured Sam,\nas he handed it back.\"Why didn't the writer come to you, as I\nhave done?\"\"Perhaps he wanted to keep", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "\"I don't believe the letter tells the truth, sir.\"\"Because Aleck is too good-hearted a fellow to turn thief.\"\"Well, why don't you have him searched?\"Without further ado Sam was dismissed, and Captain Putnam called\nGeorge Strong to him and showed the strange letter.\"He\nmay have hidden the money and jewelry in his trunk.\"\"We will go up to his apartment,\" replied Captain Putnam, and a\nfew minutes later the pair ascended to the attic room which the\n waiter had used for several terms.They found Pop just\nfixing up for a trip to Cedarville.He nodded pleasantly, and then looked at both questioningly.\"Pop, I am afraid I have a very unpleasant duty to perform,\" began\nCaptain Putnam.\"You have heard of the robberies that have been committed?\"But--but yo' don't go fo' to distrust me, do\nyo', cap'n?\"went on the <DW52> man anxiously.\"I would like to search your trunk and your clothing, Pop.If you\nare innocent you will not object.\"\"But, sah, I didn't steal nuffin, sah.\"\"It aint right nohow to'spect an honest  pusson, sah,\"\nsaid Aleck, growing angry.I am not guilty, sah, an' dis am not treatin' me jest\nright, sah, 'deed it aint, sah.\"\"If you object, Pop, I will be under the painful necessity of\nhaving Snuggers place you under arrest.You know he is a special\nofficer for the Hall.\"At this announcement Aleck fell back completely dumfounded.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.he muttered, and sank back on a chair,\nnot knowing what to do next.CHAPTER VIII\n\nIN WHICH ALEXANDER POP RUNS AWAY\n\n\n\"Will you submit to having your trunk examined or not?\"demanded\nCaptain Putnam, after a painful pause, during which Alexander\nPop's eyes rolled wildly from one teacher to the other.\"Yo' kin examine it if yo' desire,\" said Aleck.\"But it's an\noutrage, Cap'n Putnam, an' outrage, sah!\"Without more ado Captain Putnam approached the waiter's trunk, to\nfind it locked.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.\"Dare, sah, on de nail alongside ob yo' sah.\"Soon the trunk was unlocked and the lid thrown back.The box\ncontained a miscellaneous collection of wearing apparel, which the\ncaptain pushed to one side.Then he brought out a cigar box\ncontaining some cheap jewelry and other odds and ends, as well as\ntwo five dollar bills.\"Dat money am mine, sah,\" said Aleck.\"Yo paid me dat las'\nSaturday, sall.\"\"That is true, but how did this get here, Pop?\"As Captain Putnam paused he held up a stud set with a ruby-the\nvery stud the cadet Weeks had lost!\"Dat--dat stud--I never seen dat shirt-stud before, cap'n,\n'deed I didn't,\" stammered the waiter.\"That is certainly Weeks' stud; I remember it well,\" put in George\nStrong.\"He showed it to me one day, stating it was a gift from\nhis aunt.\"\"And here is a cheap watch,\" added Captain Putnam, bringing forth\nthe article.\"No, sah--I--I never seen dat watch before,\" answered Aleck\nnervously.\"I dun reckon sumbuddy put up a job on dis poah <DW53>,\nsah,\" he continued ruefully.\"I believe the job was put up by yourself,\" answered Captain\nPutnam sternly.Alexander Pop stoutly declared\nhimself innocent, but in the face of the proofs discovered the\nmaster of the Hall would not listen to him.\"Peleg Snuggers shall take you in charge and drive down to the\nCedarville lock-up,\" said the captain.The news that some of the things had been found in Pop's trunk\nspread with great rapidity.Many were astonished to learn that he\nwas thought guilty, but a few declared that \"a <DW53> wasn't to be\ntrusted anyway.\"\"<DW65>s are all thieves,\" said Jim Caven, \"never yet saw an\nhonest one.\"\"Pop's a first-rate fellow,\nand the captain has got to have more proof against him before I'll\nbelieve him guilty.\"\"You only say that because he called you down last week,\" put in\nFrank.He referred to a tilt between the new pupil and the\n<DW52> man.Jim Caven had tried to be \"smart\" and had gotten the\nworst of the encounter.\"Yes, I think he's as honest as you are!\"burst out Tom, before he\nhad stopped to think twice.roared Jim Caven, and leaped upon\nTom, with his face as white as the wall.One blow landed on Tom's cheek and another was about to follow,\nwhen Tom dodged and came up under Caven's left arm.Then the two\nboys faced each other angrily.cried a number of the cadets, and in a twinkle\na ring was formed around the two contestants.\"I'm going to give you the worst thrashing you ever had,\" said\nCaven, but in rather a nervous tone.\"All right, Caven, go ahead and do it,\" cried Tom.\"I will stand\nup for Aleck Pop, and there you are!\"Tom launched forth and caught Caven on the right cheek.The Irish\nlad also struck out, but the blow fell short.And\nhe held Tom with one hand and hit him in the neck with the other.In the\nlatter Epistle, he congratulates him upon his being Consul elect.][Footnote 396: Without my arms.--Ver.'Inermis,' may be rendered,\n'off my guard.'][Footnote 397: Like the skiff.--Ver.'Pliaselos' is perhaps here\nused as a general name for a boat or skiff; but the vessel which was\nparticularly so called, was long and narrow, and probably received its\nname from its resemblance to a kidney-bean, which was called 'ptaselus.'The 'phaseli' were chiefly used by the Egyptians, and were of various\nsizes, from that of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage.Appian mentions them as being a medium between ships of war and merchant\nvessels.Being built for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness\nthan for their strength.127, speaks of them as\nbeing made of clay; but, of course, that can only refer to 'pha-seli' of\nthe smallest kind.][Footnote 401: That are thin.--Ver 23.[Footnote 402: Arm his breast --Ver.He alludes to the 'lorica,' or\ncuirass, which was worn by the soldiers.][Footnote 403: Of his battles.--Ver.He probably was thinking at\nthis moment of the deaths of Cornelius Gallus, and T.

and, indeed, it does\nnot seem likely, that he who was an old man in the youth of Ovid, should\nbe the same person to whom he writes from Pontus, when about fifty-six\nyears of age.The bard of Ilium died in Asia.][Footnote 481: Tragedy grew apace.--Ver.He alludes to his tragedy\nof Medea, which no longer exists.Quintilian thus speaks of it: 'The\nMedea of Ovid seems to me to prove how much he was capable of, if he had\nonly preferred to curb his genius, rather than indulge it.'][Footnote 482: Sabinus return.--Ver.He represents his friend,\nSabinus, here in the character of a 'tabellarius,' or 'letter carrier,'\ngoing with extreme speed (celer) to the various parts of the earth, and\nbringing back the answers of Ulysses to Penelope, Hippolytus to Phaedra,\n\u00c6neas to Dido, Demopho\u00f4n to Phyllis, Jason to Hypsipyle, and Phaon to\nSappho.All these works of Sabinus have perished, except the Epistle of\nUlysses to Penelope, and Demopho\u00f4n to Phyllis.His Epistle from Paris\nto Oenonc, is not here mentioned.See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.[Footnote 483: Bring back letters.--Ver.As the ancients had\nno establishment corresponding to our posts, they employed special\nmessengers called 'tabellarii,' for the conveyance of their letters.][Footnote 484: Vowed to Phobus.--Ver.Sappho says in her Epistle,\nthat if Phaon should refuse to return, she will dedicate her lyre to\nPhobus, and throw herself from the Leucadian rock.This, he tells her,\nshe may now-do, as by his answer Phaon declines to return.][Footnote 485: Pain in her head.--Ver.She pretended a head-ache,\nwhen nothing wras the matter with her;

and that he did not compose, or even contemplate the\ncomposition of his Metamorphoses, until many years afterwards.][Footnote 515: I am not sitting here.--Ver.He is here alluding to\nthe Circen-sian games, which were celebrating in the Circus Maximus, or\ngreatest Circus, at Rome, at different times in the year.Some account\nis given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1.392. of the Second Book\nof the Fasti.The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the\nFourth of the Ides of April.The buildings of the Circus were burnt in\nthe conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored\ntill the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former\nmagnificence, and made it capable, according to some authors, of\naccommodating 385,000 persons.The Poet says, that he takes no\nparticular interest himself in the race, but hopes that the horse may\nwin which is her favourite.][Footnote 516: The spirited steeds.--Ver.The usual number of\nchariots in each race was four.The charioteers were divided into four\ncompanies, or 'fac-tiones,' each distinguished by a colour, representing\nthe season of the year.These colours were green for the spring, red for\nthe summer, azure for the autumn, and white for the winter.Originally,\nbut two chariots started in each race; but Domitian increased the number\nto six, appointing two new companies of charioteers, the golden and the\npurple; however the number was still, more usually, restricted to four.The greatest interest was shewn by all classes, and by both sexes, in\nthe race.Lists of the horses were circulated, with their names and\ncolours;

the lowest\nbeing, very probably, almost flush with the ground.There were, perhaps,\nno backs to the seats, or, at the best, only a slight railing of wood.The knees consequently of those in the back row would be level, and in\njuxta-position with the backs of those in front.He is here telling the\nperson who is sitting behind, to be good enough to keep his knees to\nhimself, and not to hurt the lady's back by pressing against her.][Footnote 528: I am taking it up.--Ver.He is here showing off his\npoliteness, and will not give her the trouble of gathering up her dress.Even in those days, the ladies seem to have had no objection to their\ndresses doing the work of the scavenger's broom.][Footnote 529: The fleet Atalanta.--Ver.Some suppose that the\nArcadian Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, was beloved by a youth of the\nname of Milanion.According to Apollodorus, who evidently confounds\nthe Arcadian with the Boeotian Atalanta, Milanion was another name of\nHippo-menes, who conquered the latter in the foot race, as mentioned\nin the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses.See the Translation of the\nMetamorphoses, p.From this and another passage of Ovid, we have\nreason to suppose that Atalanta was, by tradition, famous for the beauty\nof her ancles.][Footnote 530: The fan may cause.--Ver.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Instead of the word\n'tabella,' 'flabella' has been suggested here; but as the first syllable\nis long, such a reading would occasion a violation of the laws of metre,\nand 'tabella' is probably correct.It has, however, the same meaning\nhere as 'flabella it signifying what we should call 'a fan;' in fact,\nthe 'flabellum' was a 'tabella,' or thin board, edged with peacocks'\nfeathers, or those of other birds, and sometimes with variegated pieces\nof cloth.These were generally waved by female slaves, who were called\n'flabellifer\u00e6'; or else by eunuchs or young boys.They were used to cool\nthe atmosphere, to drive away gnats and flies, and to promote sleep.We here see a gentleman offering to fan a lady, as a compliment; and it\nmust have been especially grateful amid the dust and heat of the Roman\nCircus.That which was especially intended for the purpose of driving\naway flies, was called'muscarium.'The use of fans was not confined\nto females; as we learn from Suetonius, that the Emperor Augustus had\na slave to fan him during his sleep.The fan was also sometimes made of\nlinen, extended upon a light frame, and sometimes of the two wings of a\nbird, joined back to back, and attached to a handle.][Footnote 531: Now the procession.--Ver.34 All this time they have\nbeen waiting for the ceremony to commence.The 'Pompa,' or procession,\nnow opens the performance.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.In this all those who were about to exhibit\nin the race took a part.The statues of the Gods were borne on wooden\nplatforms on the shoulders of men, or on wheels, according as they\nwere light or heavy.The procession moved from the Capitol, through the\nForum, to the Circus Maximus, and was also attended by the officers of\nstate.Musicians and dancers preceded the statues of the Gods.[Footnote 532: Victory borne.--Ver.On the wooden platform, which\nwas called 'ferculum,' or 'thensa,' according as it was small or large.][Footnote 533: With expanded wings.--Ver.Victory was always\nrepresented with expanded wings, on account of her inconstancy and\nvolatility.][Footnote 534: Salute Neptune.--Ver.'Plaudite Neptuno' is\nequivalent, in our common parlance, to 'Give a cheer for Neptune.'He\nis addressing the sailors who may be present: but he declines to have\nanything to do with the sea himself.][Footnote 535: Arms I detest.--Ver.Like his contemporary, Horace,\nOvid was no lover of war.][Footnote 536: Of the artisan.--Ver.We learn from the Fasti, Book\niii.1.815, that Minerva was especially venerated as the patroness of\nhandicrafts.][Footnote 537: Let the boxers.--Ver.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Boxing was one of the earliest\nathletic games practised by the Greeks.Apollo and Hercules, as well as\nPollux, are celebrated by the poets for excelling in this exercise.It formed a portion of the Olympic contests; while boys fought in the\nNemean and Isthmian games.Concerning the 'c\u00e6stus' used by pugilists,\nsee the Fasti, Book ii.The method\nin fighting most practised was to remain on the defensive, and thus to\nwear out the opponent by continual efforts.To inflict blows, without\nreceiving any in return on the body, was the great point of merit.The\nright arm was chiefly used for attack, while the office of the left was\nto protect the body.Teeth were often knocked out, and the ears were\nmuch disfigured.The boxers, by the rules of the game, were not allowed\nto take hold of each other, nor to trip up their antagonist.In Italy\nboxing seems to have been practised from early times by the people of\nEtruria.It continued to be one of the popular games during the period\nof the Republic as well as of the Empire.][Footnote 538: In the lattice work.--Ver.The 'cancelli' were\nlattice work, which probably fkirted the outer edge of each wide\n'pr\u00e6cinctio,' or passage,that ran along in front of the seats, at\ncertain intervals.As the knees would not there be so cramped, these\nseats would be considered the most desirable.It is clear that Ovid and\nthe lady have had the good fortune to secure front seats, with the feet\nresting either on the lowest 'pr\u00e6cinctio', or the 'pr\u00e6cinctio' of a set\nof seats higher up.Stools, of course, could not be used, as they would\nbe in the way of passers-by.He perceives, as the seat is high, that she\nhas some difficulty in touching the ground with her feet, and naturally\nconcludes that her legs must ache; on which he tells her, if it will\ngive her ease, to rest the tips of her feet on the lattice work railing\nwhich was opposite, and which, if they were on an upper 'pr\u00e6cinctio,'\nran along the edge of it: or if they were on the very lowest tier,\nskirted the edge of the 'podium' which formed the basis of that tier.This she might do, if the 'pr\u00e6cinctio' was not more than a yard wide,\nand if the 'cancelli' were as much as a foot in height.][Footnote 539: Now the Prcetor.--Ver.The course is now clear\nof the procession, and the Pr\u00e6tor gives the signal for the start, the\n'carceres' being first opened.This was sometimes given by sound of\ntrumpet, or more frequently by letting fall a napkin; at least, after\nthe time of Nero, who is said, on one occasion, while taking a meal, to\nhave heard the shouts of the people who were impatient for the race to\nbegin, on which he threw down his napkin as the signal.][Footnote 540: The even harriers.--Ver.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.From this description we\nshould be apt to think that the start was effected at the instant when\nthe 'carceres' were opened.This was not the case: for after coming out\nof the-carceres,' the chariots were ranged abreast before a white line,\nwhich was held by men whose office it was to do, and who were called\n'moratores.'When all were ready, and the signal had been given, the\nwhite line was thrown down, and the race commenced, which was seven\ntimes round the course.The 'career' is called '\u00e6quum,' because they\nwere in a straight line, and each chariot was ranged in front of the\ndoor of its 'career.'][Footnote 541: Circuit far too wide.--Ver.The charioteer, whom the\nlady favours, is going too wide of the'meta,' or turning-place, and so\nloses ground, while the next overtakes him.][Footnote 542: To the left.--Ver.He tells him to guide the horses\nto the left, so as to keep closer to the'meta,' and not to lose so much\nground by going wide of it.][Footnote 543: Call him back again.--Ver.He, by accident, lets\ndrop the observation, that they have been interesting themselves for\na blockhead.But he immediately checks himself, and, anxious that the\nfavourite may yet distinguish himself, trusts that the spectators\nwill call him back.Crispinus, the Delphin Editor, thinks, that by the\ncalling back, it is meant that it was a false start, and that the race\nwas to be run over again.Bur-mann, however, is not of that opinion;\nbut supposes, that if any chariot did not go well, or the horses seemed\njaded, it was the custom to call the driver back from the present race,\nthat with new horses he might join in the next race.This, from the\nsequel, seems the most rational mode of explanation here.][Footnote 544: Waving the garments.--Ver.The signal for stopping\nwas given by the men rising and shaking and waving their outer garments,\nor 'togae,' and probably calling the charioteer by name.][Footnote 545: Disarrange your hair.--Ver.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.He is afraid lest her\nneighbours, in their vehemence should discommode her hair, and tells\nher, in joke, that she may creep into the bosom of his own 'toga.'][Footnote 546: And now the barrier.--Ver.The first race we are to\nsuppose finished, and the second begins similarly to the first.There\nwere generally twenty-five of these'missus,' or races in a day.]<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.[Footnote 547: The variegated throng.--Ver.[Footnote 548: At all events.--Ver.He addresses the favourite, who\nhas again started in this race.][Footnote 549: Bears away the palm.--Ver.The favourite charioteer\nis now victorious, and the Poet hopes that he himself may gain the palm\nin like manner.The victor descended from his car at the end of the\nrace, and ascended the'spina,' where he received his reward, which was\ngenerally a considerable sum of money.For an account of the'spina,'\nsee the Metamorphoses, Book x. l.[Footnote 550: Her beauty remains.--Ver.She has not been punished\nwith ugliness, as a judgment for her treachery.][Footnote 551: Proved false to me.--Ver.Tibullus has a similar\npassage, 'Et si perque suos fallax juravit ocellos 'and if with her eyes\nthe deceitful damsel is forsworn.'][Footnote 552: Its divine sway.--Ver.Yet he was animated by what we may call a _restless spirit_.He ran away\nfrom home at twelve years of age, and came to Kentucky with a family\nof emigrants, who settled near Boone Station, in 1791.Kentucky, until\nafter Wayne's treaty, in 1795, was continually exposed to incursions\nfrom the Indians; yet, before Tom's day of manhood, the bloody contest\nbetween the white and the red men had terminated on the virgin soil of\nthe new-born State--Kentucky was admitted into the Union in 1792.Yet\nthe heroic struggles with the Indians by the early settlers were fresh\nin the memories of all.Prior to the settlement of Kentucky by white\nmen, the Southern and Northwestern tribes of Indians were in the habit\nof hunting here as upon neutral ground.No wigwam had been erected,\nbut it was claimed by all as a hunting ground.The frequent and fierce\nconflicts that occurred upon the meeting of the Indian tribes, together\nwith conflicts with white men, caused the Indians first to call Kentucky\n\u201c_The dark and bloody ground_.\u201d At no point on the American Continent\nhad the hatred between the two races risen to a higher point.Long\nafter the peace between England and America, and the close of the war\nof American Independence, the conflict between the white and red men in\nKentucky was a war of extermination.The quiet cabin of the white man\nwas frequently entered, under cover of night, by some roving band of\nIndians, and women and children tomahawked in cold blood.White men when\ntaken by them, whether in the field at work, or behind a tree, watching\ntheir opportunity to shoot an Indian, were taken off to their towns\nin Ohio and burned at the stake, or tortured to death in a most cruel\nmanner.No wonder the early", "question": "Where is Mary?

of wine they had none, but distilling\n_corn whisky_ was among the first industries of Kentucky, and at every\nwedding there was a custom called _running for the bottle_, which was of\ncourse a bottle of whisky.The father of the bride, or some male acquaintance at the house of\nthe bride--about one hour previous to the time announced for the\nceremony--would stand on the door-step with the bottle in his hand,\nready to deliver it to the first young man that approached him.At the\nappointed time the young men of the neighborhood would rendezvous at a\npoint agreed upon, and when all were ready and the word _go_ given, the\nrace for the bottle, on fine horses, to the number of fifteen or twenty,\nwas amusing and highly exciting.Tom had the good fortune to be the\nowner of a fleet horse--to own a fine horse and saddle was ever the\npride and ambition of the young Kentuckian--and he won many bottles;\nbut the end proved that it was bad instead of good luck, for Tom\nsubsequently became too fond of the bottle.Tom was young and hopeful, far away from his kindred, and he also\nmarried the daughter of an Englishman, who was not so fortunate as to be\nthe owner of any portion of the virgin soil, but distinguished himself\nas a fine gardener, and all the inheritance Tom received with his wife\nwas a _cart-load of gourds_.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.You laugh, but you must remember that a few pewter plates and cob-handle\nknives was all that adorned the cupboards of some of our fathers, and\ngourds of different size made useful vessels.Coffee was not much in\nuse, and in the dawn of the Revolution a party of brave Americans had\nthrown a ship-load of tea into the sea.Tom, like many of the young planters, built a cabin upon a tract of\nland, under the Henderson claim, as purchased from the Cherokee Indians,\nwhich claim was subsequently set aside by the State of Virginia.Tom, as we have said, was of a restless disposition, and from a planter\nhe turned to be a boatman.Leaving his family at home in their cabin, he\nengaged to make a trip to Fort Washington (Cincinnati, then a village)\non a keel-boat, descending the Kentucky and ascending the Ohio rivers.On this trip he first beheld the stupendous precipices on the Kentucky\nriver, where the banks in many places are three hundred feet high, of\nsolid limestone, and the beautiful country at he mouth of the Kentucky,\non the Ohio river.He was absent from home three months, for prior to steam navigation, the\nOhio had been navigated by keel and flat-bottom boats for a quarter of a\ncentury, and many of the old boatmen were men of dissipated habits--_bad\nschool for Tom_.When he returned home it was too late in the season\nto raise a crop.Tom and his little\nfamily keenly felt the grasp of poverty, and many times, in the dead\nhour of night, when the cold wind made the only audible sound on the\noutside, the latch-string of the cabin door had been pulled in, and the\nfire burned down to a bed of coals, Tom and his wife sat quietly and\nsadly by the dim light of a tallow candle, and told the stories of their\nfamilies.Tom intended at some future time to return to Virginia and\nclaim an inheritance, although, as he said, he was not the eldest son\nof his father, and by the laws of Virginia the eldest son is entitled to\nall of the estate in land, which, as he said, caused him to leave home;\nbut from other sources he hoped in the future to reap the benefit of an\ninheritance.Tom's wife, in her turn, told the story of her ancestors in the old\ncountry, and how she lived in hope of some revival of family fortune,\nwhich by the discovery of the necessary papers, would give her the means\nof rising above the cold grasp of poverty, so keenly felt by them; and\nmany times through the long nights of winter, in that secret chamber\nwhere no intruder comes, Tom and his wife, whom he always called by the\nendearing name of _mother_, with a heart-felt desire to honor his infant\nchildren, had many long and interesting interviews upon the subject of\nthe _ups_ and _downs_ of family fortune.The joyous days of spring dawned upon the little household, and with it\nnew ideas in the mind of Tom Fairfield; it was to become a _preacher_;\nwhy not?He could read--and must according to the philosophy of the\npeople understand the Scriptures.Whatever may have been the delinquency\nof the early settlers in Kentucky, they were devotedly a religious\npeople.Ministers of the gospel were not required to study Theology; to be able\nto _read_ was the only accomplishment, except the _call_; it was thought\nindispensable that a _preacher_ should have _a divine call_.Whatever may be said of ignorant worship, many of the early _preachers_\nin Kentucky were men of sterling piety, and did much to elevate and\nimprove the rude society of the backwoodsmen.What they lacked in\nlearning they made up in earnestness and a strict devotion to the\n_Masters cause_; what they lacked in eloquence they made up in force.Some extracts from the sermons of these old men have been preserved.I\nquote from one handed me by a friend:\n\n\u201cAs Mo-ses lif-ted up the ser-pent in the wil-der-ness--ah!e-v-e-n so\nmust the Son of M-a-n be lif-ted up--ah!That who so-e-v-e-r look\nup-on him--ah!m-a-y not p-e-r-i-s-h--ah!but h-a-ve e-v-e-r-l-a-sting\nl-i-f-e--ah!\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding this halting delivery, these old men laid the foundation\nof the refined and elegant society now enjoyed in Kentucky.Tom Fairfield wished to improve his fortune and position in society--pay\nfor preaching was small--but the many little needs of a family\nfrequently fell to the lot of a preacher's wife.With this object in\nview, and waiting for the _call_, Tom and his wife attended all the\nmeetings.A _wonderful phenomenon_ occurred about this time, that upset\nall of Tom's calculations--it was called the _jerks_.It was principally\nconfined to the females--but men sometimes were victims of it.During the church service, and generally about the time the preacher's\nearnestness had warmed the congregation, the _jerks_ would set in.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Some\none in the congregation would commence throwing the head and upper part\nof the body backward and forward, the motion would gradually increase,\nassuming a spasmodic appearance, until all discretion would leave the\nperson attacked, and they would continue to _jerk_ regardless of all\nmodesty, until they _jerked_ themselves upon the floor.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.Tom and his wife one day attended the meeting of a _sect_, then called\nthe \u201c_New Lights._\u201d During the service Tom's wife was attacked with\nthe _jerks_; the motion slow at first became very rapid, her combs flew\namong the congregation, and her long black hair cracked like a wagon\nwhip.Tom was very much frightened, but with the assistance of some\nfriends the poor woman was taken home, and soon became quiet.The old adage that _bad luck_ never comes single-handed, was now setting\nin with Tom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Soon after this event, Tom returned from his labor one\ncold, wet evening._Mother_, as he always called his wife, was very dull\nand stupid.Tom had attended to all the duties of the little household,\npulled in the latch-string of the cabin door, covered the coals on the\nhearth with ashes--as the old people used to say, to keep the _seed_ of\nfire.In the morning when he awakened, his faithful wife, dear mother, as he\ncalled her, was by his side, _cold and dead_.With three little daughters in the cabin and nothing else in the wide\nworld, for the title to his land had been set aside.Disheartened with\nhis misfortunes, Tom, with his little daughters, moved to the Ohio\nriver.Port William was the name given to the first settlement ever made at the\nmouth of the Kentucky river.Seventy miles above Louisville the Kentucky mingles its water with the\nOhio river, the land on the east side of the Kentucky and on the south\nside of the Ohio, narrows into a sharp point--the water is deep up to\nthe shore.When navigation first commenced this point was the keel-boat\nlanding, and subsequently the steamboat landing.Here, Dave Deminish kept a saloon, (then called a grocery).One room\nsixteen feet square, filled with _cheap John merchandise_, the principal\narticle for sale was _corn whisky_, distilled in the upper counties,\nand shipped to Port William on keel boats,--this article was afterwards\ncalled _old Bourbon_.Port William was blessed with the O!-be-joyful.Redhead Sam Sims run a\nwhisky shop in connection with, his tavern, but the point, or landing\nwas the great place of attraction, here idle boatmen were always ready\nto entertain idle citizens.Old Brother Demitt owned large tracts of\nland, and a number of slaves, and of course he was a leader in society,\nwhy not?he was a member of the church if he did stand on the street\ncorners, tell low anecdotes, and drink whisky all-day-long.And old Arch\nWheataker owned slaves to work for him, and he, of course, could ride\nhis old ball-face sorrel horse to Port William, drink whisky all day and\nrun old Ball home at night.Late in December one dark night, the Angel\nof observation was looking into the room of Dave Deminish.A tall man\nwith silver gray hair was pleading with Dave for one more dram.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.They\nstood by the counter alone, and it was late, the customers had all gone\nsave Tom Fairfield.Tom offered to pledge his coat as a guarantee for\npayment, Dave was anxious to close the store (as he called it), and he\nsaid mildly as he laid his hand softly on Tom's shoulder, \u201cKeep your\ncoat on, Tom,\u201d and handing him a glass of spoiled beer, affected\nfriendship.In attempting to drink the beer Tom _heaved_.Dave was\ninsulted, and kicked him out, and closed the door.On reeling feet,\nalone, and in the dark, Tom departed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.In the middle of the night\ncommenced a wonderful snow storm, and the dawn of morning found the\nearth covered with a white mantle twenty-four inches deep.The ever diligent eye of the Angel of observation was peering into the\ncabin of Tom Fairfield, two miles distant from the _Point_, and one mile\nnorth of Brother Demitts.Roxie, the eldest daughter, found a few sticks\nof wood, which happened to be in doors, made up a little fire and was\ncooking some corn cakes.Rose had covered Suza with a tattered blanket,\nand was rocking her in a trough.The cold wind upon the outside carried\naway the inaudible murmurs of the little sisters.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.At one o'clock in the evening the little fire had burned out.Rose was\nstill engaged with the baby, and Roxie passed the time between childish\nconversations with Rose about the deep snow, and their absent father,\nwho she said would get the snow out of his way and come, home after\na while, then peeping out the crack of the door to watch for some one\npassing.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.Old Father Tearful had passed the cabin, his face and head\nwrapped up with a strap of sheepskin to ward-off the cold, and he did\nnot hear the cries of Roxie Fairfield.One hour later Suza was crying\npiteously and shivering with the cold.Roxie said firmly to Rose, you pet and coax the poor; thing and I will\ngo to Aunt-Katy's and get some one to come and, and get us some wood,\nmaking a great effort to conceal a half suppressed sob; and a starting\ntear.Then patting' Rose on the head with her little hand said\ncoaxingly, \u201cBe good to-to-the baby, and I'll soon be back.\u201d Leaving both\nlittle sisters in tears, and pulling her little bonnet close 'round her\nears, she left the cabin, and struggled bravely through the deep snow;\nfortunately when she gained the track of Father Tearful's horse she had\nless difficulty.The old man was riding a Conestoga horse whose feet and\nlegs, from their large size, made quite an opening in the snow.The Angel eye of observation peering into the east room of Brother\nDemitt's house, (he lived in a double cabin of hewn logs,) saw Aunt Katy\nsitting on one corner of the hearth-stone, busily plying her fingers\nupon a half finished stocking; upon the other corner lay a large\ndog; stretched at full length; half way between the two sat the old\nhouse-cat, eying the mastiff and the mistress, and ready to retreat from\nthe first invader.The hickory logs in the fire-place were wrapping each\nother with the red flames of heat, and the cold wind rushing 'round the\ncorner of the-house was the only sound that disturbed the stillness of\nthe hour.With a sudden push the door swung upon its hinges, and Roxie Fairfield,\nshivering with the cold, appeared upon the stage.Aunt Katy threw her\nhead back, and looking under her specs, straight down her nose at the\nlittle intruder, said, in a voice half mingled with astonishment,\n\u201cRoxie Fairfield, where in the name of heaven did you come from?\u201d Roxie,\nnothing abashed by the question, replied in a plaintive tone, \u201cDaddy\ndidn't come home all night nor all day--and--and we're 'fraid'the\nbaby'll freeze.\u201d The simple narrative of the child told Aunt Katy the\n_whole story_.She knew Tom Fairfield, and although a drunkard, he would\nnot thus desert his children.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\u201cCome to the fire, child,\u201d said Aunt Katy\nin a milder tone, and as she turned to the back door she said, mentally,\n\u201c_dead, and covered with snow_.\u201d She continued, \u201cJoe, I say, Joe, get\nold", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "Roxie made a start to return as she came, and while Aunt Katy was\ncoaxing and persuading her to wait for the slide, Joe, a <DW52> boy,\nand old Ned were gotten ready for the venture.Dick, by Aunt Katy's\ndirections, had thrown a straw bed upon the slide, and bearing his\nweight upon his right foot, he caught Roxie by the arms and carefully\nplaced her upon it.Joe, as he held the rope-reins in one hand and a long switch in the\nother, turned his eyes upon the face of the little heroine, all mingled\nwith doubt and fear, saying in a harsh tone, \u201ckeep yourself in the\nmiddle of the slide, puss, for I'm gwine to drive like litenin'.\u201d\n\nAunt Katy stood in the cold door gazing at the running horse and slide\nuntil they were out of sight, and then turning to Dick who, standing by\nthe chimney, was holding his left foot close to the coals, said, \u201cTom\nFairfield is dead and under the snow, poor soul!and them children will\nhave to be raised, and I'll bet the nittin' of five pair of stockins\nthat old Demitt will try to poke one of 'em on me.\u201d\n\nJoe soon returned with the precious charge.He had Suza, the baby, in\nher rocking trough, well wrapped up in the old blanket and placed in\nthe middle of the slide, with Roxie seated on one side and Rose on the\nother.The slide had no shafts by which the old horse could hold it\nback; it was Dick's office to hold back with a rope when drawing wood,\nbut he was too slow for this trip, and Joe's long switch served to keep\nold Ned ahead of the slide when traveling down hill.A large fire and a warm room, with Aunt Katy's pacifying tones of\nvoice, soon made the little sisters comparatively happy; she promised\nthem that daddy would soon return.The news soon spread through the neighborhood, and every one who knew\nTom Fairfield solemnly testified that he would not desert his children;\nthe irresistible conclusion was that while intoxicated he was frozen,\nand that he lay dead under the snow.A council of the settlers, (for all were considered neighbors for ten\nmiles 'round,) was called, over which Brother Demitt presided.Aunt\nKaty, as the nearest neighbor and first benefactress, claimed the\npreemption right to the first choice, which was of course granted.Roxie, the eldest, was large enough to perform some service in a family,\nand Rose would soon be; Suza, the baby, was the trouble.Aunt Katy\nwas called upon to take her choice before other preliminaries could be\nsettled.Suza, the baby, with her bright little eyes, red cheeks and proud\nefforts, to stand alone, had won Aunt Katy's affections, and she,\nwithout any persuasion on the part of old Demitt, emphatically declared\nthat Suza should never leave her house until she left it as a free\nwoman.Evaline Estep and Aunt Fillis Foster were the contending candidates\nfor Rose and Roxie.Brother Demitt decided that Aunt Fillis should take Roxie, and Mrs.Estep should be foster mother to Rose, with all the effects left in the\nFairfield cabin.These ladies lived four miles from the Demitt house, in different\ndirections.With much persuasion and kind treatment they bundled up the\nprecious little charges and departed.While the Angel of sorrow hovered round the little hearts of the\ndeparted sisters.SCENE FOURTH--ROXIE DAYMON AND ROSE SIMON.```The road of life is light and dark,\n\n```Each journeyman will make his mark;\n\n```The mark is seen by all behind,\n\n```Excepting those who go stark blind.```Men for women mark out the way,\n\n```In spite of all the rib can say;\n\n```But when the way is rough and hard,\n\n```The woman's eye will come to guard\n\n```The footsteps of her liege and lord,\n\n```With gentle tone and loving word.=\n\n|Since the curtain fell upon the closing sentence in the last scene,\nmany long and tedious seasons have passed away.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.The placid waters of the beautiful Ohio have long since been disturbed\nby steam navigation; and the music of the steam engine echoing from the\nriver hills have alarmed the bat and the owl, and broke the solitude\naround the graves of many of the first settlers.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.The infant images of the early settlers are men\nand women.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.In the order of time Roxie Fairfield, the heroine of the snow\nstorm, and Aunt Fillis Foster, claim our attention.With a few back glances at girlhood, we hasten on to her womanhood.Aunt\nFillis permitted Roxie to attend a country school a few months in each\nyear.The school house was built of round logs, was twenty feet square,\nwith one log left out on the south side for a window.The seats were\nmade of slabs from the drift wood on the Ohio River, (the first cut\nfrom the log, one side flat, the other having the shape of the log,\nrounding); holes were bored in the slabs and pins eighteen inches long\ninserted for legs.These benches were set against the wall of the room,\nand the pupils arranged sitting in rows around the room.In the center\nsat the teacher by a little square table, with a switch long enough to\nreach any pupil in the house without rising from his seat.And thus the\nheroine of the snow storm received the rudiments of an education, as she\ngrew to womanhood.Roxie was obedient, tidy--and twenty, and like all girls of her class,\nhad a lover.Aunt Fillis said Roxie kept everything about the house in\nthe right place, and was always in the right place herself; she said\nmore, she could not keep house without her.By what spirit Aunt Fillis\nwas animated we shall not undertake to say, but she forbade Roxie's\nlover the prerogative of her premises.Roxie's family blood could never submit to slavery, and she ran\naway with her lover, was married according to the common law, which\nrecognizes man and wife as one, and the man is that one.They went to Louisville, and the reader has already been introduced to\nthe womanhood of Roxie Fairfield in the person of Daymon's wife.The reader is referred to the closing sentence of Scene First.Daymon\nwas granted a new trial, which never came off, and the young couple left\nLouisville and went to Chicago, Illinois.Roxie had been concealed by a\nfemale friend, and only learned the fate of Daymon a few minutes before\nshe entered the court room.Daymon resolved to reform, for when future\nhope departed, and all but life had fled, the faithful Roxie rose like a\nspirit from the dead to come and stand by him.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.Daymon and Roxie left Louisville without any intimation of\ntheir-destination to any one, without anything to pay expenses, and\nnothing but their wearing apparel, both resolved to work, for the sun\nshone as brightly upon them as it did upon any man and woman in the\nworld.As a day laborer Daymon worked in and around the infant city, as\nignorant of the bright future as the wild ducks that hovered 'round the\nshores of the lake.It is said that P. J. Marquette, a French missionary from Canada was the\nfirst white man that settled on the spot where Chicago now stands.This\nwas before the war of the Revolution, and his residence was temporary.Many years afterward a <DW64> from San Domingo made some improvements\nat the same place; but John Kinzie is generally regarded as the first\nsettler at Chicago, for he made a permanent home there in 1804.For a\nquarter of a century the village had less than one hundred inhabitants.A wild onion that grew there, called by the Indians Chikago, gave the\nname to the city.After a few years of hard, labor and strict economy a land-holder was\nindebted to Daymon the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars.Daymon\nwished to collect his dues and emigrate farther west.By the persuasion\nof Roxie he was induced to accept a deed to fifteen acres of land.In a\nshort time he sold one acre for more than the cost of the whole tract,\nand was soon selling by the foot instead of the acre.The ever wakeful eye of the Angel of observation is peering into the\nparlor of the Daymon _palace_, to see Roxie surrounded with all the\nluxuries of furniture, sitting by an ornamented table, upon which lay\ngilt-edged paper; in the center of the table sat a pearl ink-stand and a\nglass ornament set with variegated colors.Roxie's forehead rested upon\nthe palm of her left hand, elbow on the table.Profound reflections\nare passing through her brain; they carry her back to the days of her\nchildhood.Oh, how she loved Suza; the little bright eyes gazed upon\nher and the red lips pronounced the inaudible sound, \u201c_dear sister_.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I will write,\u201d said Roxie, mentally.She takes the gold pen in\nher right hand, adjusting the paper with her left, she _paused_ to\nthank from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country\nschool had taught her the art of penmanship.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom._Hush!_ did the hall bell\nring?In a few minutes a servant appeared at the door and announced the\nname of Aunt Patsy Perkins.\u201cAdmit Aunt Patsy--tell her your mistress is at home,\u201d said Roxie,\nrising from the table.Aunt Patsy Perkins was floating upon the surface of upper-tendom\nin Chicago.She understood all of the late styles; a queen in the\ndrawing-room, understood the art precisely of entertaining company; the\ngrandest ladies in the city would listen to the council of Aunt Patsy,\nfor she could talk faster and more of it than any woman west of the\nAlleghany Mountains.The visitor enters the room; Roxie offers Aunt Patsy an easy chair;\nAunt Patsy is wiping away the perspiration with a fancy kerchief, in one\nhand, and using the fan with the other.When seated she said:\n\n\u201cI must rest a little, for I have something to tell you, and I will\ntell you now what it is before I begin.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.Old Perkins has no more love for\nstyle than I have for his _dratted poor kin_.But as I was going to tell\nyou, Perkins received a letter from Indiana, stating this Cousin Sally\nwished to make us a visit.She's a plain, poor girl, that knows no more\nof style than Perkins does of a woman's comforts.I'll tell you what\nit is, Mrs.Daymon, if she does come, if I don't make it hot for old\nPerkins, it'll be because I can't talk.A woman has nothing but her\ntongue, and while I live I will use mine.\u201d\n\nThen pointing her index finger at Roxie, continued: \u201cI will tell you\nwhat it is Mrs.Daymon, take two white beans out of one hull, and place\nthem on the top of the garden fence, and then look at 'em across the\ngarden, and if you can tell which one is the largest, you can seen what\ndifference there is in the way old Perkins hates style and I hate his\n_dratted poor kin_.What wealthy families are to do in this city, God\nonly knows.I think sometimes old Perkins is a _wooden man_, for, with\nall my style, I can make no more impression on h-i-m, than I can upon\nan oak stump, Mrs.What if he did make a thousand dollars last\nweek, when he wants to stick his _poor kin_ 'round me, like stumps in a\nflower garden.\u201d At this point Roxie ventured to say a word.\u201cAunt Patsy,\nI thought Jim was kinsfolk on your side of the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but honey, I am good to Jim, poor soul, he knows it,\u201d said Aunt\nPatsy gravely, and then she paused.Jim was a poor boy, eighteen years old, and the son of Aunt Patsy's dear\nbrother, long since laid under the dark green sod of Indiana.The poor\nboy, hearing of the wealth of his Aunt Patsy, had come to Chicago and\nwas working on the streets, poorly clad.Aunt Patsy would sometimes give him a few dollars, as you would throw\na bone to a dog, requesting him at the same time to always come to the\nback door, and never be about the house when she had company.Aunt Patsy said emphatically, as she left the Daymon palace, \u201cI'll tell\nyou what it is, Mrs.Daymon, I'm goin' home to study human nature,\nand if I don't find some avenue to reach old Perkim, I shall take the\nliberty to insult the first one of his _dratted poor kin_ that sets foot\nin my house.\u201d\n\nAfter Aunt Patsy left, Roxie thought no more of her letter of inquiry,\nand company engaged her attention for some days until the subject passed\nentirely out of her mind.Soon after these events Roxie died with the cholera--leaving an only\ndaughter--and was buried as ignorant of the fate of her sister as the\nstone that now stands upon her grave.We must now turn back more than a decade, which brings us to the burning\nof the steamboat Brandywine, on the Mississippi river.The boat was\nheavily freighted, with a large number of passengers on board; the\norigin of the fire has never been positively known; it was late in\nthe night, with a heavy breeze striking the boat aft, where the fire\noccurred.In a short time all on board was in confusion; the pilot, from\nthe confusion of the moment, or the lack of a proper knowledge of the\nriver, headed the boat for the wrong shore, and she ran a-ground on\na deep sand bar a long way from shore and burned to the waters' edge;\nbetween the two great elements of fire and water many leaped into the\nriver and were drowned, and some reached the shore on pieces of\nthe wreck.Among those fortunate enough to reach the shore was an\nEnglishman, who was so badly injured he was unable to walk; by the more\nfortunate he was carried to the cabin of a wood cutter, where he soon\nafter died.When he fully realized the situation he called for ink and paper; there\nwas none on the premises; a messenger was dispatched to the nearest\npoint where it was supposed the articles could be obtained, but he was\ntoo late.When the last moments came the dying man made the following\nstatement: \u201cMy name is John A. Lasco.I have traveled for three years\nin this country without finding the slightest trace of the object of\nmy search--an only and a dear sister.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Her name is Susan Lasco; with our\nfather she left the old country many years ago.They were poor.--the\nfamily fortune being held in abeyance by the loss of some papers.I\nremained, but our father gave up all hope and emigrated to America,\ntaking Susan with him.In the course of nature the old man is dead,\nand my sister Susan, if she is living, is the last, or soon will be the\nlast, link of the family.I am making this statement as my last will and\ntestament.Some years ago the post-master in my native town received\na letter from America stating that by the confession of one, Alonzo\nPhelps, who was condemned to die, that there was a bundle of papers\nconcealed in a certain place by him before he left the country.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.Search\nwas made and the papers found which gave me the possession of the family\nestate.The letter was subscribed D. C., which gave a poor knowledge of\nthe writer.I sold the property and emigrated to this country in search\nof my sister; I have had poor success.She probably married, and the\nceremony changed her name, and I fear she is hopelessly lost to her\nrights; her name was Susan Lasco--what it is now, God only knows.But\nto Susan Lasco, and her descendants, I will the sum of twenty thousand\ndollars, now on deposit in a western bank; the certificate of deposit\nnames the bank; the papers are wet and now upon my person; the money in\nmy pocket, $110, I will to the good woman of this house--with a request\nthat she will carefully dry and preserve my papers, and deliver them\nto some respectable lawyer in Memphis----\u201d", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.At his request,\nmade by signs, he was turned over and died in a few moments without any\nfurther directions.The inmates of the cabin, besides the good woman of the house, were only\na few wood cutters, among whom stood Brindle Bill, of Shirt-Tail\nBend notoriety.Bill, to use his own language, was _strap'd_, and was\nchopping wood at this point to raise a little money upon which to make\nanother start.Many years had passed away since he left Shirt Tail Bend.He had been three times set on shore, from steamboats, for playing sharp\ntricks at three card monte upon passengers, and he had gone to work,\nwhich he never did until he was entirely out of money.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.Brindle Bill left\nthe cabin, _ostensibly_ to go to work; but he sat upon the log, rubbed\nhis hand across his forehead, and said mentally, \u201cSusan La-s-co.By the\nlast card in the deck, _that is the name_; if I didn't hear Simon's\nwife, in Shirt-Tail Bend, years ago, say her mother's name was S-u-s-a-n\nL-a-s-c-o.I will never play another game; and--and _twenty thousand in\nbank_.By hell, I've struck a lead.\u201d\n\nThe ever open ear of the Angel of observation was catching the sound of\na conversation in the cabin of Sundown Hill in Shirt-Tail Bend.It was\nas follows--\n\n\u201cMany changes, Bill, since you left here; the Carlo wood yard has play'd\nout; Don Carlo went back to Kentucky.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.I heard he was blowed up on a\nsteamboat; if he ever come down again I did'nt hear of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope he never did,\u201d said Bill, chawing the old grudge with his eye\nteeth.Hill continued: \u201cYou see, Bill, the old wood yards have given place to\nplantations.Simon, your old friend, is making pretentions to be called\na planter,\u201d said Sundown Hill to Brindle Bill, in a tone of confidence.\u201cGo slow, Hill, there is a hen on the nest.I come back here to play a\nstrong game; twenty thousand in bank,\u201d and Brindle Bill winked with his\nright eye, the language of which is, I deal and you play the cards I\ngive you.\u201cYou heard of the burning of the Brandywine; well, there was\nan Englishman went up in that scrape, and he left twenty thousand in\nbank, and Rose Simon is the _heir_,\u201d said Bill in a tone of confidence.\u201cAnd what can that profit y-o-u?\u201d said Hill rather indignantly.\u201cI am playing this game; I want you to send for Simon,\u201d said Bill rather\ncommandingly.\u201cSimon has changed considerably since you saw him; and, besides,\nfortunes that come across the water seldom prove true.Men who have\nfortunes in their native land seldom seek fortunes in a strange\ncountry,\u201d said Hill argumentatively.\u201cThere is no mistake in this case, for uncle John had-the _di-dapper\neggs_ in his pocket,\u201d said Bill firmly.Late that evening three men, in close council, were seen, in Shirt-Tail\nBend.S. S. Simon had joined the company of the other two.After Brindle\nBill had related to Simon the events above described, the following\nquestions and answers, passed between the two:\n\n\u201cMrs.Simon's mother was named Susan Lasco?\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly; and her father's name was Tom Fairfield.She is the brave\nwoman who broke up, or rather burned up, the gambling den in Shirt-Tail\nBend.Evaline Estep, her parents having died when she was quite young.The old lady Estep tried to horn me off; but I _beat her_.Well the old\nChristian woman gave Rose a good many things, among which was a box of\nfamily keep sakes; she said they were given to her in consideration of\nher taking the youngest child of the orphan children.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.And\nabove all, his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life,\nwhich comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with\nwhich social philosophers have to deal.Lamennais had in many respects a\nfiner mind than De Maistre, but the conclusions in which he was finally\nlanded, no less than his liberal aims, prevent him from being an example\nof the truly Catholic reaction.He obviously represented the Revolution,\nor the critical spirit, within the Catholic limits, while De Maistre's\nruling idea was, in his own trenchant phrase, '_absolument tuer\nl'esprit du dix-huitieme siecle_.'On all these accounts he appears to\nbe the fittest expositor of those conceptions which the anarchy that\nclosed the eighteenth century provoked into systematic existence.FOOTNOTE:\n\n[1] See Damiron's _La Philosophie en France au XIXieme Siecle_.I.\n\n\nJoseph de Maistre was born at Chambery in the year 1754.[2] His family\nwas the younger branch of a stock in Languedoc, which about the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century divided itself into two, one\nremaining in France, the other establishing itself in Piedmont.It is\nnot wonderful that the descendants of the latter, settled in a country\nof small extent and little political importance, placed a high value on\ntheir kinship with an ancient line in the powerful kingdom of France.Joseph de Maistre himself was always particularly anxious to cultivate\nclose relations with his French kinsfolk, partly from the old\naristocratic feeling of blood, and partly from his intellectual\nappreciation of the gifts of the French mind, and its vast influence as\nan universal propagating power.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.His father held a high office in the\ngovernment of Savoy, and enjoyed so eminent a reputation that on his\ndeath both the Senate and the King of Sardinia deliberately recorded\ntheir appreciation of his loss as a public calamity.His mother is said\nto have been a woman of lofty and devout character, and her influence\nover her eldest son was exceptionally strong and tender.He used to\ndeclare in after life that he was as docile in her hands as the youngest\nof his sisters.Among other marks of his affectionate submission to\nparental authority, we are told that during the whole time of his\nresidence at Turin, where he followed a course of law, he never read a\nsingle book without previously writing to Chambery to one or other of\nhis parents for their sanction.Such traditions linger in families, and\nwhen he came to have children of his own, they too read nothing of which\ntheir father had not been asked to express his approbation.De Maistre's\nearly education was directed by the Jesuits; and as might have been\nexpected from the generous susceptibility of his temper, he never ceased\nto think of them with warm esteem.To the end of his life he remembered\nthe gloom which fell upon the household, though he was not nine years\nold at the time, when the news arrived of the edict of 1764, abolishing\nthe Society in the kingdom of France.One element of his education he\ncommemorates in a letter to his favourite daughter.'Let your brother,'\nhe says, 'work hard at the French poets.Let him learn them by heart,\nespecially the incomparable Racine; never mind whether he understands\nhim yet or not.I didn't understand him when my mother used to come\nrepeating his verses by my bedside, and lulled me to sleep with her\nfine voice to the sound of that inimitable music.I knew hundreds of\nlines long before I knew how to read; and it is thus that my ears,\naccustomed betimes to this ambrosia, have never since been able to\nendure any sourer draught.'After his law studies at the University of Turin, then highly renowned\nfor its jurisconsults, the young De Maistre went through the successive\nstages of an official career, performing various duties in the public\nadministration, and possessing among other honours a seat in the Senate,\nover which his father presided.He led a tranquil life at Chambery, then\nas at all other times an ardent reader and student.Unaided he taught\nhimself five languages.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.English he mastered so perfectly, that though he\ncould not follow it when spoken, he could read a book in that tongue\nwith as much ease as if it had been in his own.To Greek and German he\ndid not apply himself until afterwards, and he never acquired the same\nproficiency in them as in English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.To be ignorant of German then, it will be remembered, was not what it\nwould be now, to be without one of the literary senses.Like nearly every other great soldier of reaction, he showed in his\nearly life a decided inclination for new ideas.The truth that the\nwildest extravagances of youthful aspiration are a better omen of a\nvigorous and enlightened manhood than the decorous and ignoble faith in\nthe perfection of existing arrangements, was not belied in the case of\nDe Maistre.His intelligence was of too hard and exact a kind to\ninspire him with the exalted schemes that present themselves to those\nmore nobly imaginative minds who dream dreams and see visions.He\nprojected no Savoyard emigration to the banks of the Susquehanna or\nDelaware, to found millennial societies and pantisocratic unions.These\ngenerous madnesses belong to men of more poetic temper.But still, in\nspite of the deadening influences of officialism and relations with a\ncourt, De Maistre had far too vigorous and active a character to subside\nwithout resistance into the unfruitful ways of obstruction and social\ncomplacency.It is one of the most certain marks, we may be sure, of a\nsuperior spirit, that the impulses earliest awakened by its first fresh\ncontact with the facts of the outer world are those which quicken a\ndesire for the improvement of the condition of society, the increase of\nthe happiness of men, the amelioration of human destiny.With this\nunwritten condition of human nature De Maistre, like other men of his\nmental calibre, is found to have complied.He incurred the suspicion and\nill-will of most of those by whom he was immediately surrounded, by\nbelonging to a Reform Lodge at Chambery.The association was one of a\nperfectly harmless character, but being an association, it diffused a\ntarnishing vapour of social disaffection and insurgency over the names\nof all who ventured to belong to it, and De Maistre was pointed out to\nthe Sardinian court as a man with leanings towards new things, and\ntherefore one of whom it were well to beware.In very small countries there is seldom room enough\nfor the growth of a spirit of social revolution; not at least until some\ngreat and dominant country has released the forces of destruction.So,\nwhen the menacing sounds of the approaching hurricane in France grew\nheavy in the air, the little lodge at Chambery voluntarily dissolved\nitself, and De Maistre was deputed to convey to the king, Victor Amadeo\nIII., the honourable assurance of its members that they had assembled\nfor the last time.In 1786, at the age of thirty-two, De Maistre had married, and when the\nstorm burst which destroyed all the hopes of his life, he was the father\nof two children.In one of his gay letters to a venerable lady who was\non intimate terms with them both, he has left a picture of his wife,\nwhich is not any less interesting for what it reveals of his own\ncharacter.'The contrast between us two is the very strangest in the\nworld.For me, as you may have found out, I am the _pococurante_\nsenator, and above all things very free in saying what I think.She, on\nthe contrary, will take care that it is noon before allowing that the\nsun has risen, for fear of committing herself.She knows what must be\ndone or what must not be done on the tenth of October 1808, at ten\no'clock in the morning, to avoid some inconvenience which otherwise\nwould come to pass at midnight between the fifteenth and sixteenth of\nMarch 1810.\"But, my dear husband, you pay attention to nothing; you\nbelieve that nobody is thinking of any harm.Now I know, I have been\ntold, I have guessed, I foresee, I warn you,\" etc.\"Come now, my dear,\nleave me alone.You are only wasting your time: I foresee that I shall\nnever foresee things: that's your business.\"She is the supplement to\nme, and hence when I am separated from her, as I am now, I suffer\nabsurdly from being obliged to think about my own affairs; I would\nrather have to chop wood all day.... My children ought to kiss her very\nsteps; for my part, I have no gift for education.She has such a gift,\nthat I look upon it as nothing less than the eighth endowment of the\nHoly Ghost; I mean a certain fond persecution by which it is given her\nto torment her children from morning to night to do something, not to do\nsomething, to learn--and yet without for a moment losing their tender\naffection for her.She was\nlaughingly called by himself and her friends, Madame Prudence.It is\ncertain that few women have found more necessity for the qualities\nimplied in this creditable nickname.They had not been married many years before they were overtaken by\nirreparable disaster.The French Revolution broke out, and Savoy was\ninvaded by the troops of the new Republic.Count De Maistre, with his\nwife and children, fled from Chambery across the Alps to Aosta.'_Ma\nchere amie_,' he said to his wife, by the side of a great rock which he\nnever afterwards forgot, 'the step that we are taking to-day is\nirrevocable; it decides our lot for life;' and the presentiment was\ntrue.Soon the _Loi des Allobroges_ was promulgated, which enjoined upon\nall who had left their homes in Savoy to return instantly, under pain of\nconfiscation of all their property.Madame de Maistre was in the ninth month of her pregnancy.She knew that\nher husband would endure anything rather than expose her to the risks of\na journey in such a season.So, urged by a desire to save something from\nthe wreck of their fortune by compliance with the French decree, she\nseized the opportunity of her husband's absence at Turin, and started\nfor Savoy without acquainting him with her design.Bernard in the beginning of January on the back of a mule,\naccompanied by her two little children wrapped in blankets.The Count,\non his return to Aosta two or three days afterwards, forthwith set off\nin her steps, in the trembling expectation of finding her dead or dying\nin some Alpine hovel.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.But the favour of fate and a stout heart brought\nher safe to Chambery, where shortly afterwards she was joined by her\nhusband.The authorities vainly tendered him the oath, vainly bade him\ninscribe his name on the register of citizens; and when they asked him\nfor a contribution to support the war, he replied curtly that he did not\ngive money to kill his brothers in the service of the King of Sardinia.As soon as his wife was delivered of their third child, whom he was\ndestined not to see again for nearly twenty years, he quitted her side,\nabandoned his property and his country, and took refuge at Lausanne,\nwhere in time his wife and his two eldest children once more came to\nhim.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Gibbon tells us how a swarm of emigrants, escaping from the public ruin,\nwas attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the language of\nLausanne.'They are entitled to our pity,' he reflected, 'and they may\nclaim our esteem, but they cannot in their present state of mind and\nfortune contribute much to our amusement.Instead of looking down as\ncalm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our domestic harmony\nis somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit.'Gibbon died in\nLondon almost at the very moment that De Maistre arrived at Lausanne,\nbut his account of things remained true, and political feuds continued\nto run as high as ever.Among the people with whom De Maistre was thrown\nwas Madame de Stael.'As we had not been to the same school,' he says,\n'either in theology or in politics, we had some scenes enough to make\none die of laughter; still without quarrelling.Her father,", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "So I allowed the\n_emigres_ who surrounded us to cry out as they would, without ever\ndrawing the sword.'De Maistre thought he never came across a head so\ncompletely turned wrong as Madame de Stael's, the infallible\nconsequence, as he took it to be, of modern philosophy operating upon a\nwoman's nature.if Madame de Stael had been\nCatholic, she would have been adorable, instead of famous.'We can\nbelieve that his position among the French _emigres_ was not\nparticularly congenial.For though they hated the Revolution, they had\nall drunk of the waters of the eighteenth century philosophy, and De\nMaistre hated this philosophy worse than he hated the Revolution itself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.Then again, they would naturally vapour about the necessities of strong\ngovernment.'Yes,' said the Savoyard exile, 'but be quite sure that, to\nmake the monarchy strong, you must rest it on the laws, avoiding\neverything arbitrary, too frequent commissions, and all ministerial\njobberies.'We may well believe how unsavoury this rational and just\ntalk was to people who meant by strong government a system that should\nrestore to them their old prerogatives of anti-social oppression and\nselfish corruption.The order that De Maistre vindicated was a very\ndifferent thing from the deadly and poisonous order which was the object\nof the prayers of the incorrigible royalists around him.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.After staying three years at Lausanne, De Maistre went to Turin, but\nshortly afterwards the Sardinian king, at the end of a long struggle,\nwas forced to succumb to the power of the French, then in the full tide\nof success.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Bonaparte's brilliant Italian campaign needs no words here.The French entered Turin, and De Maistre, being an _emigre_, had to\nleave it.Furnished with a false passport, and undergoing a thousand\nhardships and dangers, he made his way, once more in the depth of a\nsevere winter (1797), to Venice.He went part of the way down the Po in\na small trading ship, crowded with ladies, priests, monks, soldiers, and\na bishop.There was only one small fire on board, at which all the\ncooking had to be done, and where the unhappy passengers had to keep\nthemselves warm as they could.At night they were confined each to a\nspace about three planks broad, separated from neighbours by pieces of\ncanvas hanging from a rope above.Each bank of the river was lined by\nmilitary posts--the left by the Austrians, and the right by the French;\nand the danger of being fired into was constantly present to aggravate\nthe misery of overcrowding, scanty food, and bitter cold.Even this\nwretchedness was surpassed by the hardships which confronted the exiles\nat Venice.The physical distress endured here by De Maistre and his\nunfortunate family exceeded that of any other period of their\nwanderings.He was cut off from the court, and from all his relations\nand friends, and reduced for the means of existence to a few fragments\nof silver plate, which had somehow been saved from the universal wreck.This slender resource grew less day by day, and when that was exhausted\nthe prospect was a blank.The student of De Maistre's philosophy may see\nin what crushing personal anguish some of its most sinister growths had\ntheir roots.When the cares of beggary come suddenly upon a man in\nmiddle life, they burn very deep.Alone, and starving for a cause that\nis dear to him, he might encounter the grimness of fate with a fortitude\nin which there should be many elevating and consoling elements.But the\ndestiny is intolerably hard which condemns a man of humane mould, as De\nMaistre certainly was, to look helplessly on the physical pains of a\ntender woman and famishing little ones.The anxieties that press upon\nhis heart in such calamity as this are too sharp, too tightened, and too\nsordid for him to draw a single free breath, or to raise his eyes for a\nsingle moment of relief from the monstrous perplexity that chokes him.The hour of bereavement has its bitterness, but the bitterness is\ngradually suffused with soft reminiscence.The grip of beggary leaves a\nmark on such a character as De Maistre's which no prosperity of after\ndays effaces.The seeming inhumanity of his theory of life, which is so\nrevolting to comfortable people like M. Villemain, was in truth the only\nexplanation of his own cruel sufferings in which he could find any\nsolace.It was not that he hated mankind, but that his destiny looked as\nif God hated him, and this was a horrible moral complexity out of which\nhe could only extricate himself by a theory in which pain and torment\nseem to stand out as the main facts in human existence.Hope smiled on him momentarily,\nbut, in his own words: 'It was only a flash in the night.'While he was\nin Venice, the armies of Austria and Russia reconquered the north of\nItaly, and Charles Emanuel IV., in the natural anticipation that the\nallies would at once restore his dominions, hastened forward.Austria,\nhowever, as De Maistre had seen long before, was indifferent or even\nabsolutely hostile to Sardinian interests, and she successfully opposed\nCharles Emanuel's restoration.The king received the news of the perfidy\nof his nominal ally at Florence, but not until after he had made\narrangements for rewarding the fidelity of some of his most loyal\nadherents.It was from Florence that De Maistre received the king's nomination to\nthe chief place in the government of the island of Sardinia.Through the\nshort time of his administration here, he was overwhelmed with vexations\nonly a little more endurable than the physical distresses which had\nweighed him down at Venice.During the war, justice had been\nadministered in a grossly irregular manner.Hence, people had taken the\nlaw into their own hands, and retaliation had completed the round of\nwrong-doing.The higher\nclass exhibited an invincible repugnance to paying their debts.Some of\nthese difficulties in the way of firm and orderly government were\ninsuperable, and De Maistre vexed his soul in an unequal and only\npartially successful contest.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.In after years, amid the miseries of his\nlife in Russia, he wrote to his brother thus: 'Sometimes in moments of\nsolitude that I multiply as much as I possibly can, I throw my head back\non the cushion of my sofa, and there with my four walls around me, far\nfrom all that is dear to me, confronted by a sombre and impenetrable\nfuture, I recall the days when in a little town that you know well'--he\nmeant Cagliari--'with my head resting on another sofa, and only seeing\naround our own exclusive circle (good heavens, what an impertinence!)little men and little things, I used to ask myself: \"Am I then condemned\nto live and die in this place, like a limpet on a rock?\"I suffered\nbitterly; my head was overloaded, wearied, flattened, by the enormous\nweight of Nothing.'In 1802 he received an order\nfrom the king to proceed to St.Petersburg as envoy extraordinary and\nminister plenipotentiary at the court of Russia.Even from this bitter\nproof of devotion to his sovereign he did not shrink.He had to tear\nhimself from his wife and children, without any certainty when so cruel\na separation would be likely to end; to take up new functions which the\ncircumstances of the time rendered excessively difficult; while the\npetty importance of the power he represented, and its mendicant attitude\nin Europe, robbed his position of that public distinction and dignity\nwhich may richly console a man for the severest private sacrifice.It is\na kind destiny which veils their future from mortal men.Fifteen years\npassed before De Maistre's exile came to a close.From 1802 to 1817 he\ndid not quit the inhospitable latitudes of northern Russia.De Maistre's letters during this desolate period furnish a striking\npicture of his manner of life and his mental state.We see in them his\nmost prominent characteristics strongly marked.Not even the\npainfulness of the writer's situation ever clouds his intrepid and\nvigorous spirit.Lively and gallant sallies of humour to his female\nfriends, sagacious judgments on the position of Europe to political\npeople, bits of learned criticism for erudite people, tender and playful\nchat with his two daughters, all these alternate with one another with\nthe most delightful effect.Whether he is writing to his little girl\nwhom he has never known, or to the king of Sardinia, or to some author\nwho sends him a book, or to a minister who has found fault with his\ndiplomacy, there is in all alike the same constant and remarkable play\nof a bright and penetrating intellectual light, coloured by a humour\nthat is now and then a little sardonic, but more often is genial and\nlambent.There is a certain semi-latent quality of hardness lying at the\nbottom of De Maistre's style, both in his letters and in his more\nelaborate compositions.His writings seem to recall the flavour and\nbouquet of some of the fortifying and stimulating wines of Burgundy,\nfrom which time and warmth have not yet drawn out a certain native\nroughness that lingers on the palate.This hardness, if one must give\nthe quality a name that only imperfectly describes it, sprang not from\nany original want of impressionableness or sensibility of nature, but\npartly from the relentless buffetings which he had to endure at the\nhands of fortune, and partly from the preponderance which had been given\nto the rational side of his mind by long habits of sedulous and accurate\nstudy.Few men knew so perfectly as he knew how to be touching without\nceasing to be masculine, nor how to go down into the dark pits of human\nlife without forgetting the broad sunlight, nor how to keep habitually\nclose to visible and palpable fact while eagerly addicted to\nspeculation.His contemplations were perhaps somewhat too near the\nground; they led him into none of those sublimer regions of subtle\nfeeling where the rarest human spirits have loved to travel; we do not\nthink of his mind among those who have gone\n\n    Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.If this kind of temper, strong, keen, frank, and a little hard and\nmordent, brought him too near a mischievous disbelief in the dignity of\nmen and their lives, at least it kept him well away from morbid weakness\nin ethics, and from beating the winds in metaphysics.But of this we\nshall see more in considering his public pieces than can be gathered\nfrom his letters.The discomforts of De Maistre's life at St.The\ndignity of his official style and title was an aggravation of the\nexceeding straitness of his means.The ruined master could do little to\nmitigate the ruin of his servant.He had to keep up the appearance of an\nambassador on the salary of a clerk.'This is the second winter,' he\nwrites to his brother in 1810, 'that I have gone through without a\npelisse, which is exactly like going without a shirt at Cagliari.When I\ncome from court a very sorry lackey throws a common cloak over my\nshoulders.'The climate suited him better than he had expected; and in\none letter he vows that he was the only living being in Russia who had\npassed two winters without fur boots and a fur hat.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.It was considered\nindispensable that he should keep a couple of servants; so, for his\nsecond, De Maistre was obliged to put up with a thief, whom he rescued\nunder the shelter of ambassadorial privilege from the hands of justice,\non condition that he would turn honest.The Austrian ambassador, with\nwhom he was on good terms, would often call to take him out to some\nentertainment.'His fine servants mount my staircase groping their way\nin the dark, and we descend preceded by a servant carrying _luminare\nminus quam ut praeesset nocti_.''I am certain,' he adds pleasantly,\n'that they make songs about me in their Austrian patois.it\nis well they can amuse themselves.'Sometimes he was reduced so far as to share the soup of his valet, for\nlack of richer and more independent fare.Then he was constantly fretted\nby enemies at home, who disliked his trenchant diplomacy, and distrusted\nthe strength and independence of a mind which was too vigorous to please\nthe old-fashioned ministers of the Sardinian court.These chagrins he\ntook as a wise man should.They disturbed him less than his separation\nfrom his family.'Six hundred leagues away from you all,' he writes to\nhis brother, 'the thoughts of my family, the reminiscences of childhood,\ntransport me with sadness.'Visions of his mother's saintly face\nhaunted his chamber; almost gloomier still was the recollection of old\nintimates with whom he had played, lived, argued, and worked for years,\nand yet who now no longer bore him in mind.There are not many glimpses\nof this melancholy in the letters meant for the eye of his beloved\n_trinite feminine_, as he playfully called his wife and two daughters.'_A quoi bon vous attrister_,' he asked bravely, '_sans raison et sans\nprofit?_' Occasionally he cannot help letting out to them how far his\nmind is removed from composure.'Every day as I return home I found my\nhouse as desolate as if it was yesterday you left me.In society the\nsame fancy pursues me, and scarcely ever quits me.'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.Music, as might be\nsurmised in so sensitive a nature, drove him almost beside himself with\nits mysterious power of intensifying the dominant emotion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.'Whenever by\nany chance I hear the harpsichord,' he says,'melancholy seizes me.The\nsound of the violin gives me such a heavy heart, that I am fain to leave\nthe company and hasten home.'He tossed in his bed at night, thinking he\nheard the sound of weeping at Turin, making a thousand efforts to\npicture to himself the looks of that 'orphan child of a living father'\nwhom he had never known, wondering if ever he should know her, and\nbattling with a myriad of black phantoms that seemed to rustle in his\ncurtains.'But you, M. de Chevalier,' he said apologetically to the\ncorrespondent to whom he told these dismal things, 'you are a father,\nyou know the cruel dreams of a waking man; if you were not of the\nprofession I would not allow my pen to write you this jeremiad.'As De\nMaistre was accustomed to think himself happy if he got three hours'\nsound sleep in the night, these sombre and terrible vigils were ample\nenough to excuse him if he had allowed them to overshadow all other\nthings.But the vigour of his intellect was too strenuous, and his\ncuriosity and interest in every object of knowledge too\ninextinguishable.'After all,' he said, 'the only thing to do is to put\non a good face, and to march to the place of torture with a few friends\nto console you on the way.This is the charming image under which I\npicture my present situation.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.Mark you,' he added, 'I always count books\namong one's consoling friends.'In one of the most gay and charming of his letters, apologising to a\nlady for the remissness of his correspondence, he explains that\ndiplomacy and books occupy every moment.'You will admit, madam, there\nis no possibility of one's shutting up books entirely.Nay, more than\never, I feel myself burning with the feverish thirst for knowledge.I\nhave had an access of it which I cannot describe to you.The most\ncurious books literally run after me, and hurry voluntarily to place\nthemselves in my hands.As soon as diplomacy gives me a moment of\nbreathing-time I rush headlong to that favourite pasture, to that\nambrosia of which the mind can never have enough--\n\n    _Et voila ce qui fait que votre ami est muet._'\n\nHe thinks himself happy if, by refusing invitations to dinner,", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "'I read, I write, I\nstudy; for after all one must know something.'In his hours of\ndepression he fancied that he only read and worked, not for the sake of\nthe knowledge, but to stupefy and tire himself out, if that were\npossible.As a student De Maistre was indefatigable.He never belonged to that\nlanguid band who hoped to learn difficult things by easy methods.The\nonly way, he warned his son, is to shut your door, to say that you are\nnot within, and to work.'Since they have set themselves to teach us how\nwe ought to learn the dead languages, you can find nobody who knows\nthem; and it is amusing enough that people who don't know them, should\nbe so obstinately bent on demonstrating the vices of the methods\nemployed by us who do know them.'He was one of those wise and laborious\nstudents who do not read without a pen in their hands.He never shrank\nfrom the useful toil of transcribing abundantly from all the books he\nread everything that could by any possibility eventually be of service\nto him in his inquiries.As soon as one of\nthem was filled, he carefully made up an index of its contents, numbered\nit, and placed it on a shelf with its unforgotten predecessors.In one\nplace he accidentally mentions that he had some thirty of these folios\nover the head of his writing-table.'If I am a pedant at home,' he said, 'at least I am as little as\npossible a pedant out of doors.'In the evening he would occasionally\nseek the society of ladies, by way of recovering some of that native\ngaiety of heart which had hitherto kept him alive.'I blow on this\nspark,' to use his own words, 'just as an old woman blows among the\nashes to get a light for her lamp.'A student and a thinker, De Maistre\nwas also a man of the world, and he may be added to the long list of\nwriters who have shown that to take an active part in public affairs and\nmix in society give a peculiar life, reality, and force to both\nscholarship and speculation.It was computed at that time that the\nauthor of a philosophic piece could not safely count upon more than a\nhundred and fifty readers in Russia; and hence, we might be sure, even\nif we had not De Maistre's word for it, that away from his own house he\nleft his philosophy behind.The vehemence of his own convictions did not\nprevent him from being socially tolerant to others who hated them.'If I\nhad the good fortune to be among his acquaintances,' he wrote of a\nheretical assailant, 'he would see that among the people with\nconvictions it would be hard to find one so free from prejudice as I am.I have many friends among the Protestants, and now that their system is\ntottering, they are all the dearer to me.'In spite of his scanty means,\nhis shabby valet, his threadbare cloak, and the humbleness of his\ndiplomatic position, the fire and honesty of his character combined with\nhis known ability to place him high in the esteem of the society of St.His fidelity, devotion, and fortitude, mellowed by many\nyears and by meditative habits, and tinged perhaps by the patrician\nconsciousness of birth, formed in him a modest dignity of manner which\nmen respected.They perceived it to be no artificial assumption, but the\noutward image of a lofty and self-respecting spirit.His brother\ndiplomatists, even the representatives of France, appear to have treated\nhim with marked consideration.His letters prove him to have been a\nfavourite among ladies.The Emperor Alexander showed him considerable\nkindness of the cheap royal sort.He conferred on his brother, Xavier de\nMaistre, a post in one of the public museums, while to the Sardinian\nenvoy's son he gave a commission in the Russian service.The first departure of this son for the campaign of 1807 occasioned some\nof the most charming passages in De Maistre's letters, both to the young\nsoldier himself and to others.For though without a touch of morbid\nexpansiveness, he never denied himself the solace of opening his heart\nto a trusted friend, and a just reserve with strangers did not hinder a\nhumane and manly confidence with intimates.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.'This morning,' he wrote to\nhis stripling, soon after he had joined the army, 'I felt a tightening\nat my heart when a pet dog came running in and jumped upon your bed,\nwhere he finds you no more.He soon perceived his mistake, and said\nclearly enough, after his own fashion: _I am mistaken; where can he be\nthen?_ As for me I have felt all that you will feel, if ever you pursue\nthis mighty trade of being a father.'And then he begs of his son if he\nshould find himself with a tape line in his hand, that he will take his\nexact measure and forward it.Soon came the news of the battle of\nFriedland, and the unhappy father thought he read the fate of his son in\nthe face of every acquaintance he met.And so it was in later campaigns,\nas De Maistre records in correspondence that glows with tender and\nhealthy solicitude.All this is worth dwelling upon, for two reasons.First, because De Maistre has been too much regarded and spoken of as a\nman of cold sensibility, and little moved by the hardships which fill\nthe destiny of our unfortunate race.And, secondly, because his own keen\nacquaintance with mental anguish helps us to understand the zeal with\nwhich he attempts to reconcile the blind cruelty and pain and torture\nendured by mortals with the benignity and wisdom of the immortal.'After\nall,' he used to say, 'there are only two real evils--remorse and\ndisease.'<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.This is true enough for an apophthegm, but as a matter of fact\nit never for an instant dulled his sensibility to far less supreme forms\nof agony than the recollection of irreparable pain struck into the lives\nof others.It is interesting and suggestive to recall how a later\npublicist viewed the ills that dwarf our little lives.'If I were asked\nto class human miseries,' said Tocqueville, 'I would do so in this\norder: first, Disease; second, Death; third, Doubt.'At a later date, he\naltered the order, and deliberately declared doubt to be the most\ninsupportable of all evils, worse than death itself.But Tocqueville was\nan aristocrat, as Guizot once told him, who accepted his defeat.He\nstood on the brink of the great torrent of democracy, and shivered.De\nMaistre was an aristocrat too, but he was incapable of knowing what\ndoubt or hesitation meant.He never dreamt that his cause was lost, and\nhe mocked and defied the Revolution to the end.We easily see how\nnatures of this sort, ardent, impetuous, unflinching, find themselves in\nthe triumphant paths that lead to remorse at their close, and how they\nthus come to feel remorse rather than doubt as the consummate agony of\nthe human mind.Having had this glimpse of De Maistre's character away from his books,\nwe need not linger long over the remaining events of his life.In 1814\nhis wife and two daughters joined him in the Russian capital.Two years\nlater an outburst of religious fanaticism caused the sudden expulsion of\nthe Jesuits from Russia, to De Maistre's deep mortification.Several\nconversions had taken place from the Orthodox to the Western faith, and\nthese inflamed the Orthodox party, headed by the Prince de Galitzin, the\nminister of public worship, with violent theological fury.De Maistre,\nwhose intense attachment to his own creed was well known, fell under\nsuspicion of having connived at these conversions, and the Emperor\nhimself went so far as to question him.'I told him,' De Maistre says,\n'that I had never changed the faith of any of his subjects, but that if\nany of them had by chance made me a sharer of their confidence, neither\nhonour nor conscience would have allowed me to tell them that they were\nwrong.'This kind of dialogue between a sovereign and an ambassador\nimplied a situation plainly unfavourable to effective diplomacy.The\nenvoy obtained his recall, and after twenty-five years' absence returned\nto his native country (1817).On his way home, it may be noticed, De\nMaistre passed a few days in Paris, and thus, for the first and last\ntime, one of the most eminent of modern French writers found himself on\nFrench soil.The king accorded De Maistre an honourable reception, conferred upon him\na high office and a small sum of money, and lent his ear to other\ncounsellors.The philosopher, though insisting on declaring his\npolitical opinions, then, as ever, unwaveringly anti-revolutionary,\nthrew himself mainly upon that literary composition which had been his\nsolace in yet more evil days than these.They did not always receive from the\nyounger generation for whom they had fought that forbearance that must\nbe always extended to \u2018the old guard,\u2019 whose scars and defects are but\nthe blemishes of a hardly-contested battle.Success often makes people\nautocratic, and those who benefit from the success, and suffer under\nthe overbearing spirit engendered, forget their great gains in the\ngalling sensation of being ridden over rough-shod.It is an episode on\nwhich it is now unnecessary to dwell, and Dr.Inglis would always have\nbeen the first to render homage to the great pioneer work of Dr.Through it all Elsie was living in the presence chamber of her father\u2019s\nchivalrous, high-minded outlook.Whatever action she took then, must\nhave had his approval, and it was from him that she received that keen\nsense of equal justice for all.These student years threw them more than ever together.On Sundays\nthey worshipped in the morning in Free St.George\u2019s Church, and in the\nevening in the Episcopal Cathedral.Inglis was a great walker, and\nElsie said, \u2018I learnt to walk when I used to take those long walks with\nfather, after mother died.\u2019 Then she would explain how you _should_\nwalk.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\u2018Your whole body should go into it, and not just your feet.\u2019\n\nOf these student days her niece, Evelyn Simson, says:--\n\n \u2018When she was about eighteen she began to wear a bonnet on Sunday.She\n was the last _girl_ in our connection to wear one.My Aunt Eva who is\n two years younger never did, so I think the fashion must have changed\n just then.I remember thinking how very grown up she must be.\u2019\n\nAnother niece writes:--\n\n \u2018At the time when it became the fashion for girls to wear their hair\n short, when she went out one day, and came home with a closely-cropped\n head, I bitterly resented the loss of Aunt Elsie\u2019s beautiful shining\n fair hair, which had been a real glory to her face.She herself was\n most delighted with the new style, especially with the saving of\n trouble in hairdressing.\u2018She only allowed her hair to grow long again because she thought\n it was better for a woman doctor to dress well and as becomingly as\n possible.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.This opinion only grew as she became older, and had been\n longer in the profession; in her student days she rather prided\n herself on not caring about personal appearance, and she dressed very\n badly.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.\u2018Her sense of fairplay was very strong.Once in college there was an\n opposition aroused to the Student Christian Union, and a report was\n spread that the students belonging to it were neglecting their college\n work.It happened to be the time for the class examinations, and the\n lists were posted on the College notice-board.were found printed opposite the names of all the\n students who belonged to the Christian Union, and, as these happened\n to head the list in most instances, the unfair report was effectually\n silenced.No one knew who had initialed the list; it was some time\n afterwards I discovered it had been Aunt Elsie.She embroidered and made entirely\n herself two lovely little flannel garments for her first grand-nephew,\n in the midst of her busy life, then filled to overflowing with the\n work of her growing practice, and of her suffrage activities.\u2018The babies as they arrived in the families met with her special love.In her short summer holidays with any of us, the children were her\n great delight.\u2018She was a great believer in an open-air life.One summer she took\n three of us a short walking tour from Callander, and we did enjoy it.We tramped over the hills, and finally arrived at Crianlarich, only to\n find the hotel crammed and no sleeping accommodation.She would take\n no refusal, and persuaded the manager to let us sleep on mattresses in\n the drawing-room, which added to the adventures of our trip.\u2018On the way she entertained us with tales of her college life, and\n imbued us with our first enthusiasm for the women\u2019s cause.\u2018When I myself began to study medicine, no one could have been more\n enthusiastically encouraging, and even through the stormy and somewhat\n depressing times of the early career of the Medical College for Women,\n Edinburgh, her faith and vision never faltered, and she helped us all\n to hold on courageously.\u2019\n\nIn 1891 Elsie went to Glasgow to take the examination for the Triple\nQualification at the Medical School there.She could not then take\nsurgery in Edinburgh, and the facilities for clinical teaching were all\nmore favourable in Glasgow.It was probably better for her to be away from all the difficulties\nconnected with the opening of the second School of Medicine for Women\nin Edinburgh.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Jex Blake was the Edinburgh School\nof Medicine for Women, and the one promoted by Elsie Inglis and other\nwomen students was known as the Medical College for Women.\u2018It was with\nthe fortunes of this school that she was more closely associated,\u2019\nwrites Dr.In Glasgow she resided at the Y.W.C.A.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.Her father did not\nwish her to live alone in lodgings, and she accommodated herself very\nwillingly to the conditions under which she had to live.Miss Grant,\nthe superintendent, became her warm friend.Elsie\u2019s absence from home\nenabled her to give a vivid picture of her life in her daily letters to\nher father.\u2018It was not nice seeing you go off and being left all alone.After I\n have finished this letter I am going to set to work.It seems there\n are twelve or fourteen girls boarding here, and there are regular\n rules.Miss Grant told me if I did not like some of them to speak to\n her, but I am not going to be such a goose as that.One rule is you\n are to make your own bed, which she did not think I could do!But I\n said I could make it beautifully.I would much rather do what all the\n others do.Well, I arranged my room, and it is as neat as a new pin.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Then we walked up to the hospital, to the dispensary; we were there\n till 4.30, as there were thirty-six patients, and thirty-one of them\n new.\u2018I am most comfortable here, and I am going to work like _anything_.I\n told Miss Barclay so, and she said, \u201cOh goodness, we shall all have to\n look out for our laurels!\u201d\u2019\n\n      \u2018_Feb.7, \u201991._\n\n \u2018Mary Sinclair says it is no good going to the dispensaries on\n Saturday, as there are no students there, and the doctors don\u2019t take\n the trouble to teach.I\n was the first there, so he let me help him with an operation; then I\n went over to Dr.9._\n\n \u2018This morning I spent the whole time in Dr.I could not think what he meant, he asked me so\n many questions.It seems it is his way of greeting a new student.Some\n of them cannot bear him, but I think he is really nice, though he can\n be abominably sarcastic, and he is a first-rate surgeon and capital\n teacher.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.\u2018To-day, it was the medical jurists and the police officers he was\n down on, and he told story after story of how they work by red tape,\n according to the text-books.He said that, while he was casualty\n surgeon, one police officer said to him that it was no good having him\n there, for he never would try to make the medical", "question": "Where is Mary? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Once they brought in a woman stabbed\n in her wrist, and said they had caught the man who had done it running\n away, and he had a knife.MacEwan said the cut had been done by\n glass and not by a knife, so they could not convict the man, and there\n was an awful row over it.Some of them went down to the alley where\n it had happened, and sure enough there was a pane of glass smashed\n right through the centre.When the woman knew she was found out, she\n confessed she had done it herself.The moral he impressed on us was to\n examine your patient before you hear the story.is beginning to get headaches and not sleep at night.I am\n thankful to say that is not one of my tricks.Miss G. is getting\n unhappy about her, and is going to send up beef-tea every evening.She offered me some, but I like my glass of milk much better.I am\n taking my tonic and my tramp regularly, so I ought to keep well.I am\n quite disgusted when girls break down through working too hard.They\n must remember they are not as strong as men, and then they do idiotic\n things, such as taking no exercise, into the bargain.MacEwan asked us to-day to get the first stray \u00a320,000 we could\n for him, as he wants to build a proper private hospital.So I said he\n should have the second \u00a320,000 I came across, as I wanted the first\n to build and endow a woman\u2019s College in Edinburgh.He said he thought\n that would be great waste; there should not be separate colleges.\u201cIf\n women are going to be doctors, equal with the men, they should go to\n the same school.\u201d I said I quite agreed with him, but when they won\u2019t\n admit you, what are you to do?<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.\u201cLeave them alone,\u201d he said; \u201cthey will\n admit you in time,\u201d and he thought outside colleges would only delay\n that.MacEwan\u2019s wards a very curious case came in.Some\n of us tried to draw it, never thinking he would see us, and suddenly\n he swooped round and insisted on seeing every one of the scribbles.He has eyes, I believe, in the back of his head and ears everywhere.He forgot, I thought, to have the ligature taken off a leg he was\n operating on, and I said so in the lowest whisper to M. S. About five\n minutes afterwards, he calmly looked straight over to us, and said,\n \u201c_Now_, we\u2019ll take off the ligature!\u201d\n\n \u2018I went round this morning and saw a few of my patients.I found one\n woman up who ought to have been in bed.I discovered she had been up\n all night because her husband came in tipsy about eleven o\u2019clock.I think he ought to have been\n horse-whipped, and when I have the vote I shall vote that all men who\n turn their wives and families out of doors at eleven o\u2019clock at night,\n especially when the wife is ill, shall be horse-whipped.And, if they\n make the excuse that they were tipsy, I should give them double.They\n would very soon learn to behave themselves.\u2018As to the father of the cherubs you ask about, his family does not\n seem to lie very heavily on his mind.He is not in work just now, and\n apparently is very often out of work.One cannot take things seriously\n in that house.\u2018In the house over the Clyde I saw the funniest sight.It is an Irish\n house, as dirty as a pig-sty, and there are about ten children.When\n I got there, at least six of the children were in the room, and half\n of them without a particle of clothing.They were sitting about on the\n table and on the floor like little cherubs with black faces.I burst\n out laughing when I saw them, and they all joined in most heartily,\n including the mother, though not one of them saw the joke, for they\n came and stood just as they were round me in a ring to see the baby\n washed.Suddenly, the cherubs began to disappear and ragged children\n to appear instead.I looked round to see who was dressing them, but\n there was no one there.They just slipped on their little black\n frocks, without a thing on underneath, and departed to the street as\n soon as the baby was washed.\u2018Three women with broken legs have come in.I don\u2019t believe so many\n women have ever broken their legs together in one day before!One of\n them is a shirt finisher.She sews on the buttons and puts in the\n gores at the rate of 4\u00bdd.We know the shop, and they\n _sell_ the shirts at 4s.Of course, political economy is\n quite true, but I hope that shopkeeper, if ever he comes back to this\n earth, will be a woman and have to finish shirts at 4\u00bdd.a dozen, and\n then he\u2019ll see the other side of the question.I told the woman it was\n her own fault for taking such small wages, at which she seemed amused.It is funny the stimulating effect a big school has on a hospital.The\n Royal here is nearly as big and quite as rich as the Edinburgh Royal,\n but there is no pretence that they really are in their teaching and\n arrangements the third hospital in the kingdom, as they are in size._The_ London Hospital is the biggest, and then comes Edinburgh, and\n this is the third.Guy\u2019s and Bart.\u2019s, that one hears so much about,\n are quite small in comparison, but they have big medical schools\n attached.The doctors seem to lie on their oars if they don\u2019t have to\n teach.1892._\n\n \u2018I thought the Emperor of Germany\u2019s speech the most impertinent piece\n of self-glorification I ever met with.Steed\u2019s egotism is perfect\n humility beside it.He and his house are the chosen instruments of\n \u201cour supreme Lord,\u201d and anybody who does not approve of what he does\n had better clear out of Germany.As you say, Makomet and Luther and\n all the great epoch-makers had a great belief in themselves and their\n mission, but the German Emperor will have to give some further proof\n of his divine commission (beyond a supreme belief in himself) before\n I, for one, will give in my submission.I\n think it was perfectly blasphemous.\u2018The _Herald_ has an article about wild women.Andrews has opened the flood-gates, and now there is the deluge.Andrews has done very well--degrees and mixed classes from next\n October.Don\u2019t you think our Court might send a memorial to the\n University Court about medical degrees?It is splendid having Sir\n William Muir on our side, and I believe the bulk of the Senators are\n all right--they only want a little shove.\u2019\n\nIn Glasgow the women students had to encounter the opposition to \u2018mixed\nclasses,\u2019 and the fight centred in the Infirmary.It would have been\nmore honest to have promulgated the decision of the Managers before\nthe women students had paid their fees for the full course of medical\ntuition.Elsie, in her letters, describes the toughly fought contest, and the\nfinal victory won by the help of the just and enlightened leaders in\nthe medical world.\u2018So here is another fight,\u2019 writes the student, with\na sigh of only a half regret!It was too good a fight, and the backers\nwere too strong for the women students not to win their undoubted\nrights.Through all the chaffing and laughter, one perceives the thread\nof a resolute purpose, and Elsie\u2019s great gift, the unconquerable facing\nof \u2018the Hill Difficulty.\u2019 True, the baffled and puzzled enemy often\nplayed into their hands, as when Dr.T., driven to extremity in a weak\nmoment, threatened to prevent their attendance by \u2018physical force.\u2019\nThe threat armed the students with yet another legal grievance.Elsie\ndescribes on one occasion in her haste going into a ward where Dr.Gemmel, one of the \u2018mixed\u2019 objectors, was demonstrating.She perceived\nher mistake, and retreated, not before receiving a smile from her\nenemy.The now Sir William MacEwan enjoyed the fight quite as much as\nhis women students; and if to-day he notes the achievements of the\nScottish Women\u2019s Hospitals, he may count as his own some of their\nsuccess in the profession in which he has achieved so worthy a name.The dispute went on until at length an exhausted foe laid down its\nweapons, and the redoubtable Dr.T. conveyed the intimation that the\nwomen students might go to any of the classes--and a benison on them!The faction fight, like many another in the brave days of old,\nroared and clattered down the paved causeways of Glasgow.T., in\nhis gate-house, must have wished his petticoat foes many times away\nand above the pass.If he, or any of the obstructionists of that day\nsurvive, we know that they belong to a sect that needs no repentance.They may, however, note with self-complacency that their action trained\non a generation skilled in the contest of fighting for democratic\nrights in the realm of knowledge.It is a birthright to enter into that\ngateway, and the keys are given to all who possess the understanding\nmind and reverent attitude towards all truth.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.1891._\n\n \u2018Those old wretches, the Infirmary Managers, have reared their heads\n again, and now have decided that we are not to go to mixed classes,\n and we have been tearing all over the wards seeing all sorts of people\n about it.Crossing the\n quadrangle, a porter rushed at me and said, \u201cDr.T. wants to see\n all the lady students at the gate-house.\u201d I remarked to Miss M.,\n \u201cI am certainly not going to trot after Dr.He can put up a notice if he wants me.\u201d We were going\n upstairs to Dr.R. when another porter ran up and said, \u201cDr.He would be much obliged if you would speak to him.\u201d\n So we laughed, and said that was more polite anyhow, and went into\n the office.So he hummed and hawed, looked everywhere except at\n us, and then said the Infirmary Managers said we were not to go to\n mixed classes.So I promptly said, \u201cThen I shall come for my fees\n to-morrow,\u201d and walked out of the room.K., who said he was awfuly sorry and angry, and he would\n see Dr.T., but he was afraid he could do nothing.But you see we cannot be beat here, for\n the same reason that we cannot beat them in Edinburgh.Were the\n managers, managers a hundred times over, they cannot turn Mr.\u2018The _Glasgow Herald_ had an article the other day, saying there\n was a radical change in the country, and that no one was taking any\n notice of it, and no one knew where it was to land us.This was the\n draft

WOMEN\n\nDUBLIN\n\nTHE ROTUNDA\n\n1892-1894\n\n    \u2018We take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson,\n    Pioneers, O Pioneers.\u2019--WALT WHITMAN.After completing her clinical work in Glasgow, and passing the\nexamination for the Triple Qualification in 1892, it was decided that\nElsie should go to London and work as house-surgeon in the new Hospital\nfor Women in the Euston Road.In 1916 that hospital kept its jubilee\nyear, and when Elsie went to work there it had been established for\nnearly thirty years.Its story contains the record of the leading names\namong women doctors.In the commemorative prayer of Bishop Paget, an\nespecial thanksgiving was made \u2018for the good example of those now at\nrest, Elizabeth Blackwell, and Sophia Jex Blake, of good work done\nby women doctors throughout the whole world, and now especially of\nthe high trust and great responsibility committed to women doctors in\nthis hour of need.\u2019 The hearts of many present went over the washing\nseas, to the lands wasted by fire and sword, and to the leader of\nthe Scottish Women\u2019s Hospitals, who had gained her earliest surgical\nexperience in the wards of the first hospital founded by the first\nwoman doctor, and standing for the new principle that women can\npractise the healing art.Elsie Inglis took up her work with keen energy and a happy power\nof combining work with varied interests.In the active months of\nher residence she resolutely \u2018tramped\u2019 London, attended most of the\noutstanding churches, and was a great sermon taster of ministers\nranging from Boyd Carpenter to Father Maturin.Innumerable relatives\nand friends tempted her to lawn tennis and the theatres.She had a keen\neye to all the humours of the staff, and formed her own opinions on\npatients and doctors with her usual independence of judgment.Elsie\u2019s letters to her father were detailed and written daily.Only a\nvery small selection can be quoted, but every one of them is instinct\nwith a buoyant outlook, and they are full of the joy of service.It is interesting to read in these letters her descriptions of the work\nof Dr.Garrett Anderson, and then to read Dr.Louisa Garrett Anderson\u2019s\nspeech on her mother at the jubilee of the hospital.\u2018I shall never\nforget her at Victoria Station on the day when the Women\u2019s Hospital\nCorps was leaving England for France, early in September 1914.She was\nquite an old woman, her life\u2019s work done, but the light of battle was\nin her eyes, and she said, \u201cHad I been twenty years younger I would\nhave been taking you myself.\u201d Just twenty-one years before the war\nbroke down the last of the barriers against women\u2019s work as doctors,\nElsie Inglis entered the New Hospital for Women, to learn with that\nstaff of women doctors who had achieved so much under conditions so\nfull of difficulties and discouragements.\u2018NEW HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN,\n      \u2018EUSTON

Anderson said she was going to speak to Mrs.M\u2018Call about my\n having one of her maternity posts.I shall come home first, however,\n my own dearest Papa.G.

Anderson will be a nice chaperone\n and introduce one properly.I am to go early, and her son is to look\n out for me, and begin the introducing till she comes.Miss Garrett has\n been to-day painting the hall for the Chicago Exhibition.She is going\n to the dance to-night.Fawcett got some more money out\n of the English Commissioners in a lovely way.These Commissioners have\n spent \u00a317,000 in building themselves a kiosk in the ground, and they\n allowed Mrs.Fawcett \u00a3500 to represent women\u2019s work in England.Fawcett has managed to get an\n extra \u00a3500.She wrote, and said that if she did not get any more she\n could not mount all the photographs and drawings, but would put up a\n notice that \u201cthe English Commission was too poor to allow for mounting\n and framing.\u201d This, with the kiosk in the ground!\u2018One of the patients here was once upon a time a servant at the\n Baroness Burdett Coutts\u2019.She certainly was most awfully kind to\n her, sent her \u00a310 to pay her rent, and has now paid to send her to\n the Cottage.Miss B. is in hopes she may get her interested in the\n hospital now, but it seems she does not approve of women doctors and\n such things.Perhaps, as the old housemaid did so well here, she may\n change her mind.I shall send them to some of\n the doctors in Edinburgh.Robertson left \u00a31000 in\n memory of his wife to the hospital, and that is how that bed comes to\n be called the \u201cCaroline Croom Robertson bed.\u201d\n\n \u2018We had two big operations to-day.We had the usual round in the\n morning, and then we had to prepare.This\n morning, I pointed out to Mrs.Scharlieb with indignation that our\n galvanic battery had run out.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.I said that it really was disgraceful\n of C., for it had only been used once for a quarter of an hour since\n the last time he had charged it.S. agreed, and said she would go\n in and speak to him and tell him to send her battery, which was with\n him being charged.We wanted a battery for the galvanic cautery.I tried it, and found it would not\n heat the cautery properly.So I was very angry, and I sat down and\n wrote C. a peppery letter.I told him to send some competent person\n _at once_ to look at the battery, and to be prepared to lend us one,\n if this competent person saw it was necessary.M. flew off, and in\n twenty minutes a man from C. arrived, very humble.I turned on the\n batteries, and showed him that they would not heat up properly.Sister\n said I talked to him like a mother.He departed very humbly to bring\n another battery.In about half an hour Sister whistled up, C.\u2019s man\n would like to see me.He looked at me with a twinkle in\n his eye.\u201cYou had not taken the resistance off, Miss,\u201d and held one of\n the cautery red-hot attached to our own battery.And the amount of nervous energy I had wasted on\n that battery!\u2018We began to-day with a big operation.The chloroform was given by a Dr.B., some special friend of the\n patient, so, I hoped there would be no hitch, and there was none.He\n had the cheek afterwards to say to Dr.S., that no one could have done\n it better!S. seemed rather pleased, but I thought it awfully\n patronising, was it not?S. and Miss Walker were talking the other\n morning of the time when they would make this a qualifying hospital?Miss C. said it would certainly come some day, and of course, to make\n it a qualifying hospital, they must have men\u2019s beds, and that will\n mean a mixed staff.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.Then, we will\n show the old-fashioned hospitals, with their retrograde managers,\n etc., _how_ a mixed staff can work.I wonder if they will have mixed\n classes too!\u2018I enjoyed _King Lear_ very much.King\n Lear was not a bit kingly, but just a weak, old man.I suppose that\n was what he was meant to be.I shivered in my seat when the wind whistled.The last scene--the French camp on the cliffs on Dover--was really\n beautiful.\u2018Yesterday, I did a lovely thing--slept like a top till almost nine.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.I suppose I was tired after the exciting cases.Janet burst into my\n room with \u201cMrs.S. will be here in a very few minutes, Miss.\u201d So, out\n I tumbled, and tore downstairs to meet Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.I tried to\n look as if I had had breakfast _hours_ before, and I don\u2019t think she\n suspected that was my first appearance.She did her visit, and then I\n went to breakfast.G. Anderson chose that\n morning of all others to show a friend of hers round the hospital.She\n marched calmly into the board-room to find me grubbing.I saw the only\n thing to do was to be quite cool, so I got up and shook hands, and\n remarked, \u201cI am rather late this morning,\u201d and she only laughed.It\n was about 10.30, a nice time for an H.S.\u2018I did not go to hear Father Maturin after all yesterday.I have been\n very busy; we have had another big operation, doing all right so\n far.She is an artist\u2019s wife; she has had an unhappy time for four\n years, because she has been very ill, and their doctor said it was\n hysteria, and told her husband not to give in to the nonsense.Really,\n some of these general practitioners are _grand_.They send some of\n the patients in with the most outrageous diagnoses you can imagine.One woman was told her life was not worth a year\u2019s purchase, and she\n must have a big operation.We pummelled her all over,\n and could not find the grounds of his diagnosis, and finally treated\n for something quite different, and she went out well in six weeks.Her doctor came to see her, and said, \u201cWell, madam, I could not have\n believed it.\u201d It is better they should err in that direction than in\n the direction of calling real illness \u201chysteria.\u201d\n\n \u2018I mean to have a hospital of my own in Edinburgh some day.\u2018A patient with a well-balanced nervous system will get well in just\n half the time that one of these hysterical women will.There is one\n plucky little woman in just now.She has had a bad operation, but\n nothing has ever disturbed her equilibrium.She smiles away in the\n pluckiest way, and gets well more quickly than anybody.I agree with\n Kingsley: one of the necessities of the world is to teach girls to be\n brave, and not whine over everything, and the first step for that is\n to teach them to play games!\u2018Fancy who has been here this evening--Bailie Walcot.He has come\n up to London on Parliamentary business.He investigated every hole\n and corner of the hospital.Littlejohn\u2019s class with Jex\u2019s girls at Surgery Hall.It is wonderful\n how these men who would do nothing at first are beginning to see it\n pays to be neutral now.\u2018We have a lot to be grateful to J. B. for; Bailie W. told me the\n Leith managers have approached the Edinburgh managers, saying, \u201cIf\n you will undertake no more women students, we will undertake to take\n both schools, and to build immediately.\u201d Bailie Walcot said he and Mr.George\u2019s were the _only_ two who opposed this.If they\n send us down to Leith we must make the best of it, and really try to\n make it a good school, but it will be a great pity.G. Anderson is a capital chaperone.I managed to go off without my ticket, and the damsel at the door was\n very severe, and said I must wait till Mrs.I\n waited quietly a minute or two, and was just going to ask her to send\n in to see if Mrs.Anderson had come, then a man marched in, and said\n in a lovely manner, \u201cI have forgotten my ticket,\u201d and she merely said,\n \u201cYou must give me your name, sir,\u201d and let him pass.After that I gave\n my name and passed too!I found I might have waited till doomsday, for\n Mrs.I danced every dance; it was a lovely floor and\n lovely music, and you may make up your mind, papa dear, that I go to\n all the balls in Edinburgh after this.They had two odd dances called\n Barn-door.I thought it would be a kind of Sir Roger, but it was the\n oddest kind of hop, skip and dance I ever saw.G. A. it\n was something like a Schottische, only not a quarter so pretty.She\n said it was pretty when nicely danced, but people have not learnt it\n yet.G. A. that I could get some tea from the\n night nurse when I got home (because I wanted to dance the extras),\n but she was horrified at tea just before going to sleep, and swept me\n into the refreshment-room and made me drink soup by the gallon.We had an operation this morning, so you see\n dances don\u2019t interfere with the serious business of life.Scharlieb came in here the other day, and declared I was\n qualifying for acute bronchitis; but I told her nobody could have\n acute bronchitis who had a cold bath every morning, and had been\n brought up to open windows.This is the third sit down to your letter.Talk of women at home never being able to do anything without being\n interrupted every few minutes!I think you have only to be house\n surgeon to know what being interrupted means.They not only knock\n and march in at the door, but they also whistle up the tube--most\n frightfully startling it used to be at first, to hear a sort of shrill\n fog-horn in the room.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.There are three high temperatures, and the\n results are sent up to me whenever they are taken.We are sponging\n them, and may have to put them into cold baths, but I hope not.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.At last, news was brought to Captain Flint that a vessel answering the\none they were expecting was in sight.Flint who, with his crew of desperators, was lying at a place now\nknown as Sandy Hook, immediately started in pursuit.The doomed ship was making her\nway under a light breeze apparently unconscious of danger.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.There was one thing about the ship, that struck the pirates as rather\nunusual.There seemed to be more hands on board than were required to\nman such a vessel.\"I'm afraid there's more work for us than we've bargained for,\" said\none of the men.\"They seem to have a few passengers on board,\" remarked Flint, \"but we\ncan soon dispose of them.\"The principal part of Flint's men had stretched themselves on the\nbottom of the boat for fear of exciting the suspicion of those on\nboard the ship by their numbers.As the pirate craft approached the merchant man, apparently with no\nhostile intention, those on board the ship were watching the boat as\nclosely as they were themselves watched.As soon as they came within hailing distance, the man at the bow of\nthe boat notified the captain of the ship that he wished to come along\nside, as he had something of importance to communicate.The captain of the ship commenced apparently making preparations to\nreceive the visit, when one of the men on deck who had been observing\nthe boat for some time came to him and said:\n\n\"That's he.The man on the bow of the\nboat is the notorious pirate Flint.\"In a moment more they would be along side, and nothing could prevent\nthem from boarding the ship.In that moment the captain of the ship, by a skilful movement suddenly\ntacked his vessel about just as the pirates came up, coming in contact\nwith the boat in such a manner as to split her in two in a moment.A dozen men sprung up from the bottom of the boat, uttering horrid\ncurses while they endeavored to reach the ship or cling to portions of\ntheir shattered boat.The greater portion of them were drowned, as no efforts were made to\nrescue them.Three only succeeded in reaching the deck of the ship in safety, and\nthese would probably have rather followed their comrades had they\nknown how few were going to escape.These three were Captain Flint, the one called the Parson and Old\nRopes.These were at first disposed to show fight, but it was of no use.Their arms had been lost in their struggle in the water.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.They were soon overpowered and put in irons.Great was the excitement caused in the goodly little City of New York,\nby the arrival of the merchant ship bringing as prisoners, the daring\npirate with two of his men whose fearful deeds had caused all the\ninhabitants of the land to thrill with horror.And great was the surprise of the citizens to find in that terrible\npirate a well-known member of the community, and one whom nearly all\nregarded as a worthy member of society.Another cause of surprise to the good people of the city, was the\narrival by this vessel, of one whom all had long given up as lost, and\nthat was Henry Billings, the lover of Hellena Rosenthrall.He it was who had recognized in the commander of the whale boat, the\npirate Flint, and had warned the captain of the ship of his danger,\nthereby enabling him to save his vessel", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "Captain Flint made a slight mistake when he took the vessel by which\nhe was run down, for the India man he was looking out for.It was an\nordinary merchant ship from Amsterdam, freighted with merchandise from\nthat port.Though in appearance she very much resembled the vessel\nwhich Captain Flint had taken her for.The reason young Billings happened to be on board of her was this:\n\nIt will be remembered that when the ship in which Billings had taken\npassage for Europe, was attacked by the pirates, he was forced to walk\nthe plank.By the pirates, he was of course supposed to have been drowned, but in\nthis they were mistaken.He had been in the water but a few moments\nwhen he came in contact with a portion of a spar which had probably\ncome from some wreck or had been washed off of some vessel.To this he lashed himself with a large handkerchief which it was his\ngood fortune to have at the time.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.Lashed to this spar he passed the night.When morning came he found that he had drifted out to sea; he could\nnot tell how far.He was out of sight of land, and no sail met his anxious gaze.His strength was nearly exhausted, and he felt a stupor coming over\nhim.How long he lay in this condition he could not tell.When he came to\nhimself, he found that he was lying in the birth of a vessel, while a\nsailor was standing at his side.He had been discovered by the Captain of a ship bound for England,\nfrom Boston.He had been taken on board, in an almost lifeless condition, and\nkindly cared for.In a little while he recovered his usual strength, and although his\nreturn home must necessarily be delayed, he trusted to be enabled\nbefore a great while to do so and bring to justice the villains who\nhad attempted his murder.Unfortunately the vessel by which he had been rescued, was wrecked on\nthe coast of Ireland, he and the crew barely escaping with their\nlives.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.After a while, he succeeded in getting to England by working his\npassage there.From London, he made his way in the same manner, to Amsterdam, where\nthe mercantile house with which he was connected being known, he found\nno difficulty in securing a passage for New York.Billings now for the first time heard the story of Hellena's\nmysterious disappearance.It immediately occurred to him that Captain Flint was some way\nconcerned in the affair not withstanding his positive denial that he\nknew anything of the matter further than he had already made known.The capture of Captain Flint, and the other two pirates of course led\nto the arrest of Jones Bradley who had been left in charge of the\nschooner.He was found on board of the vessel, which was lying a short distance\nup the river, and arrested before he had learned the fate of his\ncomrades.He was cast into prison with the rest, though each occupied a separate\ncell.As no good reason could be given for delaying the punishment of the\nprisoners, their trial was commenced immediately.The evidence against them was too clear to make a long trial\nnecessary.They were all condemned to death with the exception of Jones Bradley,\nwhose punishment on account of his not engaged in last affair, and\nhaving recommended mercy in the case of Henry Billings, was committed\nto imprisonment for life.When the time came for the carrying out of sentence of the three who\nhad been condemned to death, it was found that one of them was missing\nand that one, the greatest villain of them all, Captain Flint himself!No one had visited him on the previous\nday but Carl Rosenthrall, and he was a magistrate, and surely he would\nbe the last one to aid in the escape of a prisoner!That he was gone however, was a fact.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.But If it were a fact that he had made his escape, it was equally\ntrue, that he could not have gone very far, and the community were not\nin the humor to let such a desperate character as he was now known to\nbe, escape without making a strenuous effort to recapture him.The execution of the two who had been sentenced to die at the same\ntime, was delayed for a few days in the hope of learning from them,\nthe places where Flint would most probably fly to, but they maintained\na sullen silence on the subject.They then applied to Jones Bradley with, at first, no better result.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.But when Henry Billings, who was one of those appointed to visit him,\nhappened to allude to the strange fate of Hellena Rosenthrall, he\nhesitated a moment, and then said he knew where the girl was, and that\nshe had been captured by Captain Flint, and kept in close confinement\nby him.He had no wish he said to betray his old commander, though he knew\nthat he had been treated badly by him, but he would like to save the\nyoung woman.Captain Flint might be in the same place, but if he was, he thought\nthat he would kill the girl sooner than give her up.If Captain Flint, was not there, the only ones in the cave besides the\ngirl, were a squaw, and Captain Flint's <DW64> boy, Bill.For the sake of the girl Bradley said he would guide a party to the\ncave.This offer was at once accepted, and a party well armed, headed by\nyoung Billings, and guided by Jones Bradley, set out immediately.When Captain Flint made his escape from prison, it naturally enough\noccurred to him, that the safest place for him for awhile, would be\nthe cave.In it he thought he could remain in perfect safety, until he should\nfind an opportunity for leaving the country.The cave, or at least the secret chamber, was unknown to any except\nhis crew, and those who were confined in it.On leaving the cave, the last time, with a heartlessness worthy a\ndemon, he had barred the entrance to the cavern on the outside, so as\nto render it impossible for those confined there to escape in that\ndirection.In fact, he had, be supposed, buried them alive--left them to die of\nhunger.Captain Flint reached the entrance of the cave in safety, and found\neverything as he had left it.On reaching the inner chamber where he had left the two women and the\n<DW64> boy, he was startled to find the place apparently deserted,\nwhile all was in total darkness, except where a few rays found their\nway through the crevices of the rocks.He called the names first of one, and then another, but the only\nanswer he received was the echo of his own voice.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.They certainly could not have made their escape, for the fastenings\nwere all as he had left them.The means of striking fire were at hand, and a lamp was soon lighted.He searched the cave, but could discover no trace of the missing ones.A strange horror came over him, such as he had never felt before.The stillness oppressed him; no living enemy could have inspired him\nwith the fear he now felt from being alone in this gloomy cavern.\"I must leave this place,\" he said, \"I would rather be in prison than\nhere.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.Again he took up the lamp, and went round the cave, but more this time\nin hopes of finding some weapon to defend himself with, in case he\nshould be attacked, than with the hope of discovering the manner in\nwhich those he had left there had contrived to make their escape.It had been his custom, lately, on leaving the cavern, to take his\nweapons with him, not knowing what use might be made of them by the\nwomen under the provocation, to which they were sometimes subjected.The only weapon he could find was a large dagger.This he secured, and\nwas preparing to leave the cavern, when he thought he saw something\nmoving in one corner.In order to make sure that he had not been mistaken, he approached the\nplace.It was a corner where a quantity of skins had been thrown, and which\nit had not been convenient for him to remove, when he left the cavern.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.Thinking that one of these skins might be of service to him in the\nlife he would be obliged to live for some time, he commenced sorting\nthem over, for the purpose of finding one that would answer his\npurpose, when a figure suddenly sprang up from the pile.It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more frightened.\"Dat you, massa,\" at length exclaimed the familiar voice of Black\nBill.\"I tought it was de debil come back agin to carry me off.\"said Flint, greatly relieved, and glad to\nfind some one who could explain the strange disappearance of Hellena\nand Lightfoot.he asked; \"where's the white girl and the\nIndian woman?\"\"Debble carry dim off,\" said Bill.said his master; \"if you don't\ntell me where they've gone, I'll break your black skull for you.\"\"Don't know where dar gone,\" said Bill, tremblingly, \"Only know dat de\ndebble take dem away.\"Flint finding that he was not likely to get anything out of the boy by\nfrightening him, now changed his manner, saying;\n\n\"Never mind, Bill, let's hear all about it.\"The boy reassured, now told his master that the night before while he\nwas lying awake near the pile of skins and the women were asleep, he\nsaw the walls of the cavern divide and a figure holding a blazing\ntorch such as he had never seen before, enter the room.\"I tought,\" said Bill, \"dat it was de debble comin' arter you agin,\nmassa, and I was 'fraid he would take me along, so I crawled under de\nskins, but I made a hole so dat I could watch what he was doin'.\"\"He looked all round a spell for you, massa, an' when he couldn't find\nyou, den he went were de women was sleepin' an woke dem up and made\ndem follow him.\"Den da called me and looked all ober for me an' couldn't find me, an'\nde debble said he couldn't wait no longer, an' dat he would come for\nme annudder time, An den de walls opened agin, an' da all went true\ntogedder.When I heard you in de cave, massa, I tought it was de\ndebble come agin to fetch me, an' so I crawled under de skins agin.\"From this statement of the boy, Flint come to the conclusion that Bill\nmust have been too much frightened at the time to know what was\nactually taking place.One thing was certain, and that was the prisoners had escaped, and had\nbeen aided in their escape by some persons, to him unknown, in a most\nstrange and mysterious manner.Over and over again he questioned Black Bill, but every time with the\nsame result.The boy persisted in the statement, that he saw the whole party pass\nout through an opening in the walls of the cavern.That they had not passed out through the usual entrance was evident,\nfor he found everything as he had left it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.Again he examined the walls of the cavern, only to be again baffled\nand disappointed.He began to think that may be after all, the cavern was under a spell\nof enchantment, and that the women had actually been carried off in\nthe manner described by the <DW64>.The boy was evidently honest in his statement, believing that he was\ntelling nothing that was not true.But be all this as it might, the mere presence of a human being, even\nthough a poor <DW64> boy, was sufficient to enable him to shake off the\nfeeling of loneliness and fear, with which he was oppressed upon\nentering the cavern.He now determined to remain in the cavern for a short time.Long enough at least to make a thorough examination of the place,\nbefore taking his departure.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.This determination of Captain Flint's was by no means agreeable to the\n<DW64> boy.Bill was anxious to leave the cave, and by that means escape the\nclutches of the devil, who was in the habit of frequenting it.He endeavored to induce Flint to change his resolution by assuring him\nthat he had heard the devil say that he was coming after him.But the\ncaptain only laughed at the boy, and he was compelled to remain.For several days after the departure of Captain Flint, the inmates of\nthe cavern felt no uneasiness at his absence; but when day after day\npassed, until more than a week had elapsed without his making his\nappearance they began to be alarmed.It had uniformly been the practice of Captain Flint on leaving the\ncave, to give Lightfoot charges to remain there until his return, and\nnot to allow any one to enter, or pass out during his absence.Singularly enough he had said nothing about it the last time.This,\nhowever, made no difference with Lightfoot, for if she thought of it\nat all, she supposed that he had forgotten it.Still she felt no\ndisposition to disobey his commands, although her feelings towards\nhim, since his late brutal treatment had very much changed.But their provisions were giving out, and to remain in the cavern much\nlonger, they must starve to death.Lightfoot therefore resolved to go\nin search of the means of preventing such a catastrophe, leaving the\nothers to remain in the cave until her return.On attempting to pass out, she found to her horror that the way was\nbarred against her from the outside.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.In vain she endeavored to force her way out.There seemed to be no alternative but to await patiently the return of\nthe captain.Failing in that, they must starve to death!Their supply of provisions was not yet quite exhausted, and they\nimmediately commenced putting themselves on short allowance, hoping by\nthat means to make them last until relief should come.While the two women were sitting together, talking over the matter,\nand endeavoring to comfort each other, Hellena noticing the plain gold\nring on the finger of Lightfoot, that had been placed there by Captain\nFlint during her quarrel with the Indian, asked to be allowed to look\nat it.On examining the ring, she at once recognized it as the one worn by\nher lost lover.Her suspicions in regard to Flint were now fully confirmed.She was\nsatisfied that he was in some way concerned in the sudden\ndisappearance of the missing man.Could it be possible that he had been put out of the way by this\nvillain, who, for some reason unknown to any but himself, was now\ndesirous of disposing of her also?That night the two women retired to rest as usual.It was a long time\nbefore sleep came to their relief.The clock which the pirates had hung in the cave, struck twelve, when\nHellena started from her slumber with a suppressed cry, for the figure\nshe had seen in the vision many nights ago, stood bending over her!But now it looked more like a being of real flesh and blood, than a\nspectre.And when it spoke to her, saying, \"has the little paleface\nmaiden forgotten; no, no!\"she recognized in the intruder, her old\nfriend the Indian chief, Fire Cloud.Hellena, the feelings of childhood returning, sprang up, and throwing\nher arms around the old chief, exclaimed:\n\n\"Save me, no, no, save me!\"Lightfoot was by this time awake also, and on her feet.To her the\nappearance of the chief seemed a matter of no surprise.Not that she\nhad expected anything of the kind, but she looked upon the cave as a\nplace of enchantment, and she believed that the spirits having it in\ncharge, could cause the walls to open and close again at pleasure.And\nshe recognized Fire Cloud as one of the chiefs of her own tribe.He\nwas also a descendant of one of its priests, and was acquainted with\nall the mysteries of the cavern.He told the prisoners that he had come to set them at liberty, and\nbade them follow.They had got everything for their departure, when they observed for\nthe first time that Black Bill was missing.They could not think of going without him, leaving him there to\nperish, but the cavern was searched for him in vain.His name was\ncalled to no better purpose, till they were at last compelled to go\nwithout him, the chief promising to return and make another search for\nhim, all of which was heard by the <DW64> from his hiding place under\nthe pile of skins as related in the preceding chapter.The chief, to the surprise of Hellena, instead of going to what might\nbe called the door of the cavern, went to one of the remote corners,\nand stooping down, laid hold of a projection of rock, and gave it a\nsudden pressure, when a", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "It was\none of the contrivances of the priests of the olden time, for the\npurpose of imposing upon the ignorant and superstitious multitude.On passing through this opening, which the chief carefully closed\nafter him, the party entered a narrow passageway, leading they could\nnot see where, nor how far.The Indian led the way, carrying his torch, and assisting them over\nthe difficulties of the way, when assistance was required.Thus he led them on, over rocks, and precipices, sometimes the path\nwidening until it might be called another cavern, and then again\nbecoming so narrow as to only allow one to pass at a time.Thus they journeyed on for the better part of a mile, when they\nsuddenly came to a full stop.It seemed to Hellena that nothing short of an enchanter's wand could\nopen the way for them now, when Fire Cloud, going to the end of the\npassage, gave a large slab which formed the wall a push on the lower\npart, causing it to rise as if balanced by pivots at the center, and\nmaking an opening through which the party passed, finding themselves\nin the open air, with the stars shining brightly overhead.As soon as they had passed out the rock swung back again, and no one\nunacquainted with the fact, would have supposed that common looking\nrock to be the door of the passage leading to the mysterious cavern.The place to which they now came, was a narrow valley between the\nmountains.Pursuing their journey up this valley, they came to a collection of\nIndian wigwams, and here they halted, the chief showing them into his\nown hut, which was one of the group.Another time, it would have alarmed Hellena Rosenthrall to find\nherself in the wilderness surrounded by savages.But now, although among savages far away from home, without a white\nface to look upon, she felt a degree of security, she had long been a\nstranger to.In fact she felt that the Indians under whose protection she now found\nherself, were far more human, far less cruel, than the demon calling\nhimself a white man, out of whose hands she had so fortunately\nescaped.For once since her capture, her sleep was quiet, and refreshing.Black Bill, on leaving the captain, after having vainly endeavored to\npersuade him to leave the cave, crawled in to his usual place for\npassing the night, but not with the hope of forgetting his troubles in\nsleep.He was more firmly than ever impressed with the idea that the cavern\nwas the resort of the Devil and his imps, and that they would\ncertainly return for the purpose of carrying off his master.To this\nhe would have no objection, did he not fear that they might nab him\nalso, in order to keep his master company.So when everything was perfectly still in the cavern excepting the\nloud breathing of the captain, which gave evidence of his being fast\nasleep, the <DW64> crept cautiously out of the recess, where he had\nthrown himself down, and moved noiselessly to the place where the\ncaptain was lying.Having satisfied himself that his master was asleep, he went to the\ntable, and taking the lamp that was burning there, he moved towards\nthe entrance of the cave.This was now fastened only on the inside,\nand the fastening could be easily removed.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.In a few moments Black Bill was at liberty.As soon as he felt himself free from the cave, he gave vent to a fit\nof boisterous delight, exclaiming.Now de debile may\ncome arter massa Flint as soon as he please, he ain't a goun to ketch\ndis chile, I reckan.Serb de captain right for trowin my fadder in de\nsea.Thus he went on until the thought seeming to strike him that he might\nbe overheard, and pursued, he stopped all at once, and crept further\ninto the forest and as he thought further out of the reach of the\ndevil.The morning had far advanced when captain Flint awoke from his\nslumber.He knew this from the few sunbeams that found their way through a\ncrevice in the rocks at one corner of the cave.With this exception the place was in total darkness, for the lamp as\nwe have said had been carried off by the <DW64>.\"Hello, there, Bill, you black imp,\" shouted the captain, \"bring a\nlight.\"But Bill made no answer, although the command was several times\nrepeated.At last, Flint, in a rage, sprang up, and seizing a raw hide which he\nalways kept handy for such emergencies, he went to the sleeping place\nof the <DW64>, and struck a violent blow on the place where Bill ought\nto have been, but where Bill was not.Flint went back, and for a few moments sat down by the table in\nsilence.After awhile the horror at being alone in such a gloomy\nplace, once more came over him.\"Who knows,\" he thought, \"but this black imp may betray me into the\nhands of my enemies.Even he, should he be so disposed, has it in his\npower to come at night, and by fastening the entrance of the cavern on\nthe outside, bury me alive!\"So Flint reasoned, and so reasoning, made up his mind to leave the\ncavern.Flint had barely passed beyond the entrance of the cave, when he heard\nthe sound of approaching footsteps.He crouched under the bushes in\norder to watch and listen.He saw a party of six men approaching, all fully armed excepting one,\nwho seemed to be a guide to the rest.Flint fairly gnashed his teeth with rage as he recognised in this man\nhis old associate--Jones Bradley.The whole party halted at a little distance from the entrance to the\ncave, where Bradley desired them to remain while he should go and\nreconnoitre.He had reached the entrance, had made a careful examination of\neverything about it, and was in the act of turning to make his report,\nwhen Flint sprang upon him from the bushes, saying, \"So it's you, you\ntraitor, who has betrayed me,\" at the same moment plunging his dagger\nin the breast of Bradley, who fell dead at his feet.In the next moment the pirate was flying through the forest.Several\nshots were fired at him, but without any apparent effect.But the pirate having the\nadvantage of a start and a better knowledge of the ground, was soon\nhidden from view in the intricacies of the forest.Still the party continued their pursuit, led now by Henry Billings.As the pirate did not return the fire of his pursuers, it was evident\nthat his only weapon was the dagger with which he had killed the\nunfortunate Bradley.For several hours they continued their search, but all to no purpose,\nand they were about to give it up for the present, when one of them\nstumbled, and fell over something buried in the grass, when up sprang\nBlack Bill, who had hidden there on hearing the approach of the party.asked the boy, as soon as he had\ndiscovered that he was among friends.\"Yes; can you tell us which way he has gone?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"Gone dat way, and a-runnin' as if de debble was arter him, an' I\nguess he is, too.\"The party set off in the direction pointed out, the <DW64> following.After going about half a mile, they were brought to a full stop by a\nprecipice over which the foremost one of the party was near falling.As they came to the brink they thought they heard a whine and a low\ngrowl, as of a wild animal in distress.Looking into the ravine, a sight met their gaze, which caused them to\nshrink back with horror.At the bottom of the ravine lay the body of the man of whom they were\nin pursuit, but literally torn to pieces.Beside the body crouched an enormous she bear, apparently dying from\nwounds she had received from an encounter with the men.Could his worst enemy have wished him a severe punishment?\"De debble got him now,\" said Black Bill, and the whole party took\ntheir way back to the cave.On their way back, Billings learned from the <DW64> that Hellena in\ncompany with Lightfoot, had left the cave several days previous to\ntheir coming.He was so possessed with the idea they had been spirited away by the\ndevil, or some one of his imps in the shape of an enormous Indian,\nthat they thought he must have been frightened out of his wits.Billings was at a loss what course to take, but he had made up his\nmind not to return to the city, until he had learned something\ndefinite in relation to the fate of his intended bride.In all probability, she was at some one of the Indian villages\nbelonging to some of the tribes occupying that part of the country.For this purpose he embarked again in the small vessel in which he had\ncome up the river, intending to proceed a short distance further up,\nfor the purpose of consulting an old chief who, with his family,\noccupied a small island situated there.He had proceeded but a short distance when he saw a large fleet of\ncanoes approaching.Supposing them to belong to friendly Indians, Billings made no attempt\nto avoid them, and his boat was in a few moments surrounded by the\nsavages.At first the Indians appeared to be perfectly friendly, offering to\ntrade and, seeming particularly anxious to purchase fire-arms.This aroused the suspicions of the white men, and they commenced\nendeavoring to get rid of their troublesome visitors, when to their\nastonishment, they were informed that they were prisoners!Billings was surprised to find that the Indians, after securing their\nprisoners, instead of starting up the river again, continued their\ncourse down the stream.But what he learned shortly after from one of the Indians, who spoke\nEnglish tolerably well, astonished him still more.And that was, that\nhe was taken for the notorious pirate Captain Flint, of whose escape\nthey had heard from some of their friends recently from the city, and\nthey thought that nothing would please their white brethren so much as\nto bring him back captive.It was to no purpose that Billings endeavored to convince them of\ntheir mistake.They only shook their heads, as much as to say it was\nof no use, they were not to be so easily imposed upon.And so Billings saw there was no help for it but to await patiently\nhis arrival at New York, when all would be set right again.But in the meantime Hellena might be removed far beyond his reach.Great was the mortification in the city upon learning the mistake they\nhad made.Where they had expected to receive praise and a handsome reward for\nhaving performed a meritorious action, they obtained only censure and\nreproaches for meddling in matters that did not concern them.It was only a mistake however, and there was no help for it.And\nBillings, although greatly vexed and disappointed, saw no course left\nfor him but to set off again, although he feared that the chances of\nsuccess were greatly against him this time, on account of the time\nthat had been lost.The Indians, whose unfortunate blunder had been the cause of this\ndelay, in order to make some amends for the wrong they had done him,\nnow came forward, and offered to aid him in his search for the missing\nmaiden.They proffered him the use of their canoes to enable him to ascend the\nstreams, and to furnish guides, and an escort to protect him while\ntraveling through the country.This offer, so much better than he had any reason to expect, was\ngladly accepted by Billings, and with two friends who had volunteered\nto accompany him, he once more started up the river, under the\nprotection of his new friends.War had broken out among the various tribes on the route which he must\ntravel, making it unsafe for him and his two companions, even under\nsuch a guide and escort as his Indian friends could furnish them.Thus he with his two associates were detained so long in the Indian\ncountry, that by their friends at home they were given up as lost.At last peace was restored, and they set out on their return.The journey home was a long and tedious one, but nothing occurred\nworth narrating.Upon reaching the Hudson, they employed an Indian to take them the\nremainder of the way in a canoe.Upon reaching Manhattan Island, the first place they stopped at was\nthe residence of Carl Rosenthrall, Billings intending that the father\nof Hellena should be the first to hear the sad story of his failure\nand disappointment.It was evening when he arrived at the house and the lamps were lighted\nin the parlor.With heavy heart and trembling hands he rapped at the door.As the door opened he uttered a faint cry of surprise, which was\nanswered by a similar one by the person who admitted him.The scene that followed we shall not attempt to describe.At about the same time that Henry Billings, under the protection of\nhis Indian friends, set out on his last expedition up the river, a\nsingle canoe with four persons in it, put out from under the shadow of\nOld Crow Nest, on its way down the stream.The individual by whom the canoe was directed was an Indian, a man\nsomewhat advanced in years.The others were a white girl, an Indian\nwoman, and a <DW64> boy.In short, the party consisted of Fire Cloud, Hellena Rosenthrall,\nLightfoot, and Black Bill, on their way to the city.They had passed the fleet of canoes in which Billings had embarked,\nbut not knowing whether it belonged to a party of friendly Indians or\notherwise.Fire Cloud had avoided coming in contact with it for fear of being\ndelayed, or of the party being made prisoners and carried back again.Could they have but met, what a world of trouble would it not have\nsaved to all parties interested!As it was, Hellena arrived in safety, greatly to the delight of her\nfather and friends, who had long mourned for her as for one they never\nexpected to see again in this world.The sum of Hellena's happiness would now have been complete, had it\nnot been for the dark shadow cast over it by the absence of her lover.And this shadow grew darker, and darker, as weeks, and months, rolled\nby without bringing any tidings of the missing one.What might have been the effects of the melancholy into which she was\nfast sinking, it is hard to tell, had not the unexpected return of the\none for whose loss she was grieving, restored her once more to her\nwonted health and spirits.And here we might lay down our pen, and call our story finished, did\nwe not think that justice to the reader, required that we should\nexplain some things connected with the mysterious, cavern not yet\naccounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she\nhad seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but\nwe have not yet explained how the noises were produced which so\nalarmed the pirates.It will be remembered that the sleeping place of Black Bill was a\nrecess in the wall of the cavern.Now in the wall, near the head of the <DW64>'s bed, there was a deep\nfissure or crevice.It happened that Bill while lying awake one night,\nto amuse himself, put his month to the crevice and spoke some words,\nwhen to his astonishment, what he had said, was repeated over and\nover, again.Black Bill in his ignorance and simplicity, supposed that the echo,\nwhich came back, was an answer from some one on the other side of the\nwall.Having made this discovery, he repeated the experiment a number of\ntimes, and always with the same result.After awhile, he began to ask questions of the spirit, as he supposed\nit to be, that had spoken to him.Among other things he asked if the devil was coming after master.The echo replied, \"The debil comin' after master,\" and repeated it a\ngreat many times.Bill now became convinced that it was the devil himself that he had\nbeen talking to.On the night when the pirates were so frightened by the fearful groan,\nBill was lying awake, listening to the captain's story.When he came\nto the part where he describes the throwing the boy's father\noverboard, and speaks of the horrible groan, Bill put his mouth to the\ncrevice, and imitated the groan, which had been too deeply fixed in\nhis memory ever to be forgotten, giving full scope to his voice.The effect astonished and frightened him as well as the pirates.With the same success he imitated the Indian war-whoop, which he had\nlearned while among the savages.The next time that the pirates were so terribly frightened, the alarm\nwas caused by Fire Cloud after his visit", "question": "Where is John?
