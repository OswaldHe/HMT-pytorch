he admitted to\nit none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal\ngentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the\nduchess of Sully.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.He often went into his gardens, and passing through a\nlittle covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen\ngarden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully\nhas caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a\nterrace on the other side of the garden.It was then the taste to have a\ngreat many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of\ntrees, or palisadoes.Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,\namused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and\non the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which\nsurrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty\ntrees.There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had\ncastles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to\nwhich he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to\nthe public good.At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs\nalong the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled\nwith groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works.He embellished\n_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,\nand with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,\nwhich he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire.He\nerected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,\nof which the gardens are full.He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle\nd'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces.\"These gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby\nGooche:\n\n   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,\n   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._\n\nThat fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own\nstatement of his visit to the Duke d'Aumale's, at Anet, near Ivry,\n(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--\"Joy\nanimated the countenance of Madame d'Aumale the moment she perceived me.She gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and\nled me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make\nAnet a most enchanting place.\"One may justly apply to Sully, what he\nhimself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: \"A man for whom eloquence and\ngreat sentiments had powerful charms.\"I had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of\nthe superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV.and during\nthe succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with\nplates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;\nwith extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works\nmay have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,\nmight have been these two lines from Rapin,\n\n   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears\n   With numerous gardens stored._\n\nPerhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to\nhave monopolized our Shakspeare's line,--\"I love _France_ so well, that\nI will not part with a village of it;

and on\narriving at the foot of the scaffold, took a last and solemn farewell of\nhis children; immediately after he was dismissed into eternity.\"Sir Walter Scott, after noticing \"the wild and squalid features\" of\nMarat, who \"lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his\ncut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his\ndeath-screech was again heard,\" thus states the death of another of the\nmurderers of the Malherbes:--\"Robespierre, in an unsuccessful attempt to\nshoot himself, had only inflicted a horrible _fracture on his\nunder-jaw_.In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair,\nfoul with blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die.Robespierre lay on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal\nbox, and his hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth\nbound round his shattered chin.The Second New York Cavalry shared largely in the glories\nand miseries of this great and successful raid.At Five Forks, Deep Creek,\nand Sailors Creek, it not only maintained its gallant and meritorious\nrecord, but added to its great renown.At the gentle and joyous passage\nof arms at Appomattox Station, on the 8th of April, it reached the climax\nof its glory, and, by its deeds of daring, touched the pinnacle of fame.On that day it performed prodigies of valor, and achieved successes as\npregnant with good results as any single action of the war.By forcing a\npassage through the rebel lines and heading off Lee's army, it contributed\nlargely to the result that followed the next day--the surrender of the\nConfederate Army of Northern Virginia.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the night of the 7th of April we camped on Buffalo River.Moving at an\nearly hour on the 8th, we crossed the Lynchburg Railroad at Prospect\nStation, and headed for Appomattox Station, where it was expected we would\nstrike, if not intercept, Lee's retreating, disintegrating army.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.The trail\nwas fresh and the chase hot.Joy beamed in every eye, for all felt that\nthe end was drawing near, and we earnestly hoped that ours might be the\nglorious opportunity of striking the final blow.About noon the regiment\nwas detached to capture a force of the enemy said to be at one of the\ncrossings of the Appomattox.Some few hundreds, unarmed, half-starved,\nstragglers, with no fight in them, were found, and turned over to the\nProvost Marshall.Resuming its place in the column, I received orders to\nreport with the regiment to General Custer, who was at its head.Reporting\nin compliance with this order, General Custer informed me that his scouts\nhad reported three large trains of cars at Appomattox Station, loaded with\nsupplies for the rebel army; that he expected to have made a junction\nwith Merritt's division near this point; that his orders were to wait here\ntill Merritt joined him; that he had not heard from him since morning, and", "question": "Where is Mary?

take anything and everything\nyou can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold\nof the pike to-night.\"Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by\nme, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other\nregiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge\ndown a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery\nwas posted.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright\nlights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot\nswept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The\nline was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,\nnow pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither\nprisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and\nartillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and\nheaded for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we\ndiscovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit\nwas checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his\nroute to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that\nour cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our\nmen dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant\nColonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a\npicket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other\ndivisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late\nto take part in the fight.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took\nhours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the\nrailroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground\nto rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our\nassistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line\nwould be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work\nto head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud\nhurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming\nin rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving\ntowards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing\nlively;

his breathing\nbecame laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of\nMaggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the\nside of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his\near.\"Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,\nsir.\"He studied the young person at his\nelbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had\nhappened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently\nMaggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy\nthought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.Letting his hand\nfall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy\nbegan to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart;

\"Jimmy had to go after the wash,\"\nand then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to\nstop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, \"You needn't wait, Maggie; we\nunderstand.\"\"Sure, an' it's more 'an I do,\" answered Maggie, and shaking her head\nsadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of\nMaggie's inhuman parent.\"Just fancy,\" he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, \"fancy\nany man not liking to be the father of twins,\" and with that he again\nbent over the cradle and surveyed its contents.\"Think, Jimmy,\" he said,\nwhen he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, \"just think\nof the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.\"\"And then think of the way _I_ feel,\" grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; \"what have you to feel about?\"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a\ncrash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; \"nonsense!Here,\" he said, turning to Jimmy, \"you hold the boys and I'll go\nsee----\" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust\nupon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his\narms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,\nstrained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had\nstrode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked\nat Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining\nroom.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy\nbegan to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could\nscarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the\nbedroom door.\"She's come up the fire-escape,\" cried Aggie; \"she's beating Alfred to\ndeath.\"shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets.\"She's locking him in the bathroom,\" declared Aggie, and with that she\ndisappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of\nAggie.\"Wait a minute,\" called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find\na satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and\nhumanity.\"Eat 'em,\" was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her\nnegligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX\n\nNow, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this\ncommotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which\nhad been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly\nunprepared for the flying advent of Maggie.\"Oh, plaze, sir,\" she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward\nthe babes in Jimmy's arms, \"me fadder's coming right behind me.He's\na-lookin' for you sir.\"\"For me,\" murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth\nseemed to be looking for HIM.\"Put 'em down, sir,\" cried Maggie,", "question": "Where is Daniel?

warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the\ncradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He\nlooked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made\na determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head\nthrough the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between\nO'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.Jimmy decided\nto take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he\nstreaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that\nhe met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of\nthe Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,\nwavering as to which side to surrender himself.Lightfoot, who in her simplicity, looked upon him as a great chief,\nwas flattered by the proposal which he made her, and immediately took\ncharge of the establishment, and Captain Flint soon found that he had\nno reason to repent the choice he had made, so far as fidelity to his\ninterests was concerned.For a while at first he treated her with as much kindness as it was in\nthe nature of such as he to treat any one.He may possibly have felt some gratitude for the service she had\nrendered him, but it was self-interest more than any other feeling\nthat caused him to do all in his power to gain a controling influence\nover her.He loaded her with presents of a character suited to her uncultivated\ntaste.Her person fairly glittered with beads, and jewelry of the most gaudy\ncharacter, while of shawls and blankets of the most glaring colors,\nshe had more than she knew what to do with.This course he pursued until he fancied he had completely won her\naffection, and he could safely show himself in his true character\nwithout the risk of loosing his influence over her.His manner to her now changed, and he commenced treating her more as a\nslave than an equal, or one to whom he felt himself under obligations.It is true he would now and then treat her as formerly, and would\noccasionally make her rich presents, but it would be done in the way\nthat the master would bestow a favor on a servant.Lightfoot bore this unkind treatment for some time without resenting\nit, or appearing to notice it.Thinking perhaps that it was only a\nfreak of ill-humor that would last but for a short time, and then the\ngreat chiefs attachment would return.Flint fancied that he had won the heart of the Indian woman, and\nacting on the presumption that \"love is blind,\" he thought that he\ncould do as he pleased without loosing hold on her affections.He had only captured the woman's\nfancy.So that when Lightfoot found this altered manner of the captain's\ntowards her was not caused by a mere freak of humor, but was only his\ntrue character showing itself, her fondness for him, if fondness it\ncould be called, began to cool.Things had come to this pass, when Hellena Rosenthrall was brought\ninto the cave.The first thought of Lightfoot was that she had now discovered the\ncause of the captain's change of manner towards her.He had found\nanother object on which to lavish his favors and here was her rival.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.And she was to be the servant, the slave of this new favorite.Flint, in leaving Hellena in charge of Lightfoot, gave strict charges\nthat she should be treated with every attention, but that she should\nby no means be allowed to leave the cave.The manner of Lightfoot to Hellena, was at first sullen: and reserved,\nand although she paid her all the attention that Hellena required of\nher, she went no further.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.But after awhile, noticing the sad countenance of her paleface sister,\nand that her face was frequently bathed in tears, her heart softened\ntoward her, and she ventured to ask the cause of her sorrow.And when\nshe had heard Hellena's story, her feelings towards her underwent an\nentire change.From this time forward the two women were firm friends, and Lightfoot\npledged herself to do all in her power to restore her to her friends.Her attachment to Captain Flint was still too strong, however, to make\nher take any measures to effect that object, until she could do so\nwithout endangering his safety.But Lightfoot was not the only friend that Hellena had secured since\nher capture.She had made another, and if possible a firmer one, in\nthe person of Black Bill.From the moment Hellena entered the cavern, Bill seemed to be\nperfectly fascinated by her.Had she been an angel just from heaven,\nhis admiration for her could hardly have been greater.He could not\nkeep his eyes off of her.He followed her as she moved about, though\ngenerally at a respectful distance, and nothing delighted him so much,\nas to be allowed to wait upon her and perform for her such little acts\nof kindness as lay within his power.While Hellena was relating the story of her wrongs to Lightfoot, Black\nBill sat at a little distance off an attentive listener to the\nnarrative.When it was finished, and Hellena's eyes were filled with\ntears, the darkey sprang up saying in an encouraging tone of voice:\n\n\"Don't cry, don't cry misses, de debble's comin arter massa Flint\nberry soon, he tell me so hisself; den Black Bill take care ob de\nwhite angel.\"This sudden and earnest outburst of feeling and kindness from the\n<DW64>, expressed as it was in such a strange manner, brought a smile\nto the face of the maiden, notwithstanding the affliction which was\ncrushing her to the earth.\"Why Bill,\" said Hellena, \"you don't mean to say you ever saw the\ndevil here, do you?\"\"Never seed him, but heer'd him doe, sometimes,\" replied Bill.Now, Hellena, although a sensible girl in her way, was by no means\nfree from the superstition of the times.She believed in ghosts, and\nwitches, and fairies, and all that, and it was with a look of\nconsiderable alarm that she turned to the Indian woman, saying:\n\n\"I hope there ain't any evil spirits in this cave, Lightfoot.\"\"No spirits here dat will hurt White Rose (the name she had given to\nHellena) or Lightfoot,\" said the Indian woman.\"The spirits of the great Indian braves who have gone to the land of\nspirits come back here sometimes.\"\"Neber see dem, but hear dem sometime,\" replied Lightfoot.said Lightfoot, \"are they not my friends?\"Lightfoot perceiving that Hellena's curiosity, as well as her fears\nwere excited; now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,\ncommenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to\nthe cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:\n\nShe said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had\nput foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land\nfor a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a\ngreat nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in\nthe bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough\nto contend with them was sure to", "question": "Where is Daniel? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for\nbravery.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted\nas much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land\nwas overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was\nbecause they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to\nthem in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal\nchiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit\nwould speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,\nevery thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said\nhe would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him\nthat they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if\nhe persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and\ntold them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great\nSpirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose\nof frightening him.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a\ngreat brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to\nhim, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country\nof all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his\nown, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.And then\nhe laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into\nthe magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to\nsay.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came\nout sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,\nand his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation\nscattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.And he collected another great army, and went to war again.But by\nthis time the other nations, seeing the danger they were in, united\nagainst him as a common enemy.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.He was overthrown, killed, and his army entirely cut to pieces.The conquering army now entered this country, and laid it waste,

in order to\nescape their pursuers.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.\"Is the voice of the Great Spirit ever heard here now?\"Lightfoot said the voice of the Great Spirit had never been heard\nthere since the destruction of his favorite nation, but that the\nspirits of the braves as he had said before, did sometimes come back\nfrom the spirit-land to speak comfort to the small remnant of the\nfriends who still remained upon the earth.This narrative of the Indian woman somewhat satisfied the curiosity of\nHellena, but it did not quiet her fears, and to be imprisoned in a\ndreary cavern haunted by spirits, for aught she knew, demons, was to\nher imagination, about as terrible a situation as she could possibly\nbe placed in.CHAPTER X.\n\n\nWhen there were none of the pirates in the cave, it was the custom of\nLightfoot, and Hellena to spread their couch in the body of the\ncavern, and there pass the night.Such was the case on the night\nfollowing the day on which Lightfoot had related to Hellena the sad\nhistory of her people.It is hardly to be expected that the young girl's sleep would be very\nsound that night, with her imagination filled with visions, hob\ngoblins of every form, size, and color.During the most of the forepart of the night she lay awake thinking\nover the strange things she had heard concerning the cave, and\nexpecting every moment to see some horrible monster make its\nappearance in the shape of an enormous Indian in his war paint, and\nhis hands reeking with blood.After a while she fell into a doze in which she had a horrid dream,\nwhere all the things she had been thinking of appeared and took form,\nbut assuming shapes ten times more horrible than any her waking\nimagination could possibly have created.She had started from one of these horrid dreams,\nand afraid to go to sleep again, lay quietly gazing around the cavern\non the ever varying reflections cast by the myriads of crystals that\nglittered upon the wall and ceiling.Although there were in some portions of the cavern walls chinks or\ncrevices which let in air, and during some portion of the day a few\nstraggling sunbeams, it was found necessary even during the day to\nkeep a lamp constantly burning.And the one standing on the table in\nthe centre of the cave was never allowed to go out.As we have said, Hellena lay awake gazing about her.A perfect stillness reigned in the cave, broken only by the rather\nheavy breathing of the Indian woman who slept soundly.Suddenly she heard, or thought she heard a slight grating noise at the\nfurther side of the cavern.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.or does she actually\nsee the wall of the cavern parting?Such actually seems to be the\ncase, and from the opening out steps a figure dressed like an Indian,\nand bearing in his hand a blazing torch.Hellena's tongue cleaves to the roof of her mouth, and her limbs are\nparalyzed with terror.The figure moves about the room with a step as noiseless as the step\nof the dead, while the crystals on the walls seem to be set in motion,\nand to blaze with unnatural brilliancy as his torch is carried from\nplace to place.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.He carefully examines everything as he proceeds; particularly the\nweapons belonging to the pirates, which seemed particularly to take\nhis fancy.But he carefully replaces everything after having examined\nit.He now approaches the place where the two women are lying.The figure approached the couch; for a moment he bent over it and\ngazed intently on the two women; particularly on that of the white\nmaiden.When having apparently satisfied his curiosity, he withdrew as\nstealthily as he had come.When Hellena opened her eyes again, the spectre had vanished, and\neverything about the cave appeared as if nothing unusual had happened.For a long time she lay quietly thinking over the strange occurrences\nof the night.She was in doubt whether scenes which she had witnessed\nwere real, or were only the empty creations of a dream.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.The

but I kept mighty still, and shut my eyes when he come to look at\nme, but he didn't say noffen, so I know'd it wasn't dis darkey he was\nafter.\"This statement of the <DW64>'s satisfied Hellena that she had not been\ndreaming when she witnessed the apparition of the Indian.On further questioning Bill, she found he had not witnessed any of the\nhorrid phantoms that had visited her in her dreams.As soon as Hellena could do so without attracting attention, she took\na lamp and examined the walls in every direction to see if she could\ndiscover any where a crevice large enough for a person to pass\nthrough, but she could find nothing of the sort.The walls were rough and broken in many parts, but there was nothing\nlike what she was in search of.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.She next questioned Lightfoot about it, asking her if there was any\nother entrance to the cave beside the one through which they had\nentered.But the Indian woman gave her no satisfaction, simply telling her that\nshe might take the lamp and examine for herself.As Hellena had already done this, she was of course as much in the\ndark as ever.When Captain Flint visited the cave again as he did on the following\nday, Hellena would have related to him the occurrences of the previous\nnight, but she felt certain that he would only laugh at it as\nsomething called up by her excited imagination, or treat it as a story\nmade up for the purpose of exciting his sympathy.Tell the story of the boys who looked at the\n          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself\n          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill\n          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by\n          drinking liquor?\"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm,\" says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm\nvery quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make\nhis blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,\nhe puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your\ntongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out\nof doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold\none, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes\nthis heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of\nthe body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the\nwarmer we feel.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why\nchildren are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A\ngreat deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off\nthrough your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a\nroom full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to\nprevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much\nheat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments\nkeep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be\nworn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they\nare not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the\nseason, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and\nhandsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.This will make the hot\nblood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should\nput on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep\nwarm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are\nsometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one\npart fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside\nskin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or\na cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,\nas a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a\nburning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the\nskin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to\ncarry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be\ncolder than before.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating\nalcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to\nthe brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and\nmay freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but\nthey would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter\nday.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them\nwarm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold\nout best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose\nships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by\ndogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus\nmeat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know\nwhy.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say\nthe same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm;

nor\ngenerally any thing but that the knowledge thereof was so naturall to\nour understandings, that we could not even feigne to be ignorant of it.Besides, I made known what the Laws of Nature were; and without\ngrounding my reasons on any other principles, but on the infinite\nperfections of God, I did endeavour to demonstrate all those which might\nbe questioned, and to make them appear to be such, that although God had\ncreated divers worlds, there could have been none where they were not\nobserved.Afterwards _I_ shewed how the greater part of the Matter of\nthis _Chaos_ ought, according to those Laws, to dispose and order it\nself in a certain manner, which would make it like our Heavens: And how\nsome of these parts were to compose an Earth, and some Planets and\nCommets, some others a Sun and fix'd Starrs.And here enlarging my self\non the subject of Light, _I_ at length explain'd what that light was,\nwhich was to be in the Sun and Stars; and thence how it travers'd in an\ninstant the immense spaces of the Heavens, and how it reflected it self\nfrom Planets and Commets towards the Earth._I_ added also divers things\ntouching the substance, situation, the motions, and all the several\nqualities of these heavens and these stars: So that _I_ thought _I_ had\nsaid enough to make known, That there is nothing remarkable in those of\nthis world, which ought not, or at least could not appear altogether\nlike to these of that world which _I_ described.Thence _I_ came to speak particularly of the Earth; how, although I had\nexpresly supposed, that God had placed no weight in the Matter whereof\nit was composed; yet all its parts exactly tended towards its center:\nHow that there being water and air upon its superficies, the disposition\nof the Heavens, and of the Starrs, and chiefly of the Moon, ought to\ncause a floud and an ebb, which in all circumstances was like to that\nwhich we observe in our Seas; And besides, a certain course aswel of the\nwater, as of the air, from East to West, as is also observed between the\nTropicks: How the Mountains, the Seas, the Springs and Rivers might\nnaturally be form'd therein, and Metals run in the mines, and Plants\ngrow in the Fields, and generally all bodies be therein engendered which\nare call'd mixt or composed.And amongst other things, because that next the Stars, I know nothing in\nthe world but Fire, which produceth light, I studied to make all clearly\nunderstood which belongs to its nature; how it's made, how it's fed,\nhow sometimes it hath heat onely without light, and sometimes onely\nlight without heat; how it can introduce several colours into several\nbodies, and divers other qualities; how it dissolves some, and hardens\nothers; how it can consume almost all, or convert them into ashes and\nsmoak: and last of all, how of those ashes, by the only violence of its\naction, it forms glass.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.For this transmutation of ashes into glass,\nseeming to me to be as admirable as any other operation in Nature, I\nparticularly took pleasure to describe it.Yet would I not inferre from all these things, that this World was\ncreated after the manner I had", "question": "Where is John?

to\nwit, in demonstrating effects by their causes, and shewing from what\nseeds, and in what manner Nature ought to produce them; I contented my\nself to suppose, That God form'd the body of a Man altogether like one\nof ours; aswel the exteriour figure of its members, as in the interiour\nconformity of its organs; without framing it of other matter then of\nthat which I had described; and without putting in it at the beginning\nany reasonable soul, or any other thing to serve therein for a\nvegetative or sensitive soul; unless he stirr'd up in his heart one of\nthose fires without light which I had already discovered; and that I\nconceiv'd of no other nature but that which heats hay when its housed\nbefore it be dry, or which causes new Wines to boyl when it works upon\nthe grape: For examining the functions which might be consequently in\nthis body, I exactly found all those which may be in us, without our\nthinking of them; and to which our soul (that is to say, that distinct\npart from our bodies, whose nature (as hath been said before) is onely\nto think) consequently doth not contribute, and which are all the same\nwherein we may say unreasonable creatures resemble us.Yet could I not\nfinde any, of those which depending from the thought, are the onely ones\nwhich belong unto us as Men; whereas I found them all afterwards, having\nsupposed that God created a reasonable soul, and that he joyn'd it to\nthis body, after a certain manner which I describ'd.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.But that you might see how I treated this matter, I shall here present\nyou with the explication of the motion of the heart, and of the\narteries, which being the first and most general (which is observed in\nanimals) we may thereby easily judge what we ought to think of all the\nrest.And that we may have the less difficulty to understand what I\nshall say thereof, I wish those who are not versed in Anatomy, would\ntake the pains, before they read this, to cause the heart of some great\nanimal which hath lungs, to be dissected; for in all of them its very\nlike that of a Man: and that they may have shewn them the two cels or\nconcavities which are there: First that on the right side, whereto two\nlarge conduits answer, to wit, the _vena cava_, which is the principal\nreceptacle of bloud, and as the body of a tree, whereof all the other\nveins of the body are branches; and the arterious vein, which was so\nmis-call'd, because that in effect its an artery, which taking its\n_origine_ from the heart, divides it self after being come forth, into\ndivers branches, which every way spred themselves through the lungs.Then the other which is on the left side, whereunto in the same manner\ntwo pipes answer, which are as large, or larger then the former; to wit,\nthe veinous artery, which was also il named, forasmuch as its nothing\nelse but a vein which comes from the lungs, where its divided into\nseveral branches interlaid with those of the arterious vein, and those\nof that pipe which is called the Whistle, by which the breath enters.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.And the great artery, which proceeding from the heart, disperseth its\nbranches thorow all the body.I would also that they would carefully\nobserve the eleven little skins, which, as so many little doors, open\nand shut the four openings which are in these two concavities; to wit,\nthree at the entry of the _vena cava_, where they are so disposed, that\nthey can no wayes hinder the bloud which it contains from running into\nthe right concavity of the heart; and yet altogether hinder it from\ncoming out.Three at the entry of the arterious vein; which being\ndisposed quite contrary, permit only the bloud which is in that\nconcavity to pass to the lungs; but not that which is in the lungs to\nreturn thither.And then two others at the entry of the veinous artery,\nwhich permits the bloud to run to the left concavity of the heart, but\nopposeth its return.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.And three at the entry of the great artery, which\npermit it to go from the heart, but hinder its return thither.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.Neither\nneed we seek any other reason for the number of these skins, save only\nthat the opening of the veinous artery, being oval-wise, by reason of\nits situation, may be fitly shut with two; whereas the other, being\nround, may the better be clos'd with three.Besides, I would have them\nconsider, that the great artery and the arterious vein are of a\ncomposition much stronger then the veinous artery or the _vena cava_.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.And that these two later grow larger before they enter into the heart,\nand make (as it were) two purses, call'd the ears of the heart, which\nare composed of a flesh like it; and that there is always more heat in\nthe heart then in any other part of the body.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.And in fine, that if any\ndrop of bloud enter into these concavities, this heat is able to make it\npresently swell and dilate it self, as generally all liquors do, when\ndrop by drop we let them fall into a very hot vessel.For after this I need say no more for to unfold the motion of the\nheart, but that when these concavities are not full of bloud,\nnecessarily there runs some from the _vena cava_ into the right, and\nfrom the veinous artery into the left; for that these two vessels are\nalways full of it, and that their openings which are towards the heart\ncannot then be shut: But that assoon as there is thus but two drops of\nbloud entred, one in either of these concavities, these drops, which\ncannot but be very big, by reason that their openings whereby they enter\nare very large, and the vessels whence they come very full of bloud, are\nrarified and dilated because of the heat which they find therein.By\nmeans whereof, causing all the heart to swel, they drive and shut the\nfive little doors which are at the entry of the two vessels whence they\ncome, hindering thereby", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "And because the bloud which thus enters\ninto the heart, passeth thorow those two purses, which are call'd the\nears; thence it comes, that their motion is contrary to the heart's, and\nthat they fall when that swels.Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,\nand are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,\nmay not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise\nthem, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily\nfollows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be\nseen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our\nfingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by\nexperience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and\nfigure of its weight and wheels.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not\nexhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the\narteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart\ndischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what\nhath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must\nbe given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who\ntaught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of\nthe arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,\nenters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self\nback towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a\nperpetuall circulation.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary\nexperience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard\nabove the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to\nissue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound.And the contrary\nwould happen, were it bound underneath, between the hand and the\nincision, or bound very hard above.For its manifest, that the band\nindifferently tyed, being able to hinder the bloud which is already in\nthe arm to return towards the heart by the veins; yet it therefore\nhinders not the new from coming always by the arteries, by reason they\nare placed under the veins, and that their skin being thicker, are less\neasie to be press'd, as also that the bloud which comes from the heart,\nseeks more forcibly to passe by them towards the hand, then it doth to\nreturn from thence towards the heart by the veins.And since this bloud\nwhich issues from the arm by the incision made in one of the veins, must\nnecessarily have some passage under the bond, to wit, towards the\nextremities of the arm, whereby it may come thither by the arteries, he\nalso proves very well what he sayes of the course of the bloud through\ncertain little skins, which are so disposed in divers places along the\nveins, which permit it not to pass from the middle towards the\nextremities, but onely to return from the extremities towards the heart.And besides this, experience shews, That all the bloud which is in the\nbody may in a very little time run out by one onely artery's being cut,\nalthough it were even bound very neer the heart, and cut betwixt it and\nthe ligature: So that we could have no reason to imagine that the bloud\nwhich issued thence could come from any other part.But there are divers other things which witness, that the true cause of\nthis motion of the bloud is that which I have related.As first, The\ndifference observed between that which issues out of the veins, and that\nwhich comes out of the arteries, cannot proceed but from its being\nrarified and (as it were) distilled by passing thorow the heart: its\nmore subtil, more lively, and more hot presently after it comes out;\nthat is to say, being in the arteries, then it is a little before it\nenters them, that is to say, in the veins.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.And if you observe, you will\nfinde, that this difference appears not well but about the heart; and\nnot so much in those places which are farther off.Next, the hardnesse\nof the skin of which the artery vein and the great artery are composed,\nsheweth sufficiently, that the bloud beats against them more forcibly\nthen against the veins.And why should the left concavity of the heart,\nand the great artery be more large and ample then the right concavity,\nand the arterious vein; unless it were that the bloud of the veinous\nartery, having bin but onely in the lungs since its passage thorow the\nheart, is more subtil, and is rarified with more force and ease then the\nbloud which immediately comes from the _vena cava_.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.And what can the\nPhysicians divine by feeling of the pulse, unlesse they know, that\naccording as the bloud changeth its nature, it may by the heat of the\nheart be rarified to be more or lesse strong, and more or lesse quick\nthen before._Barce._ (_alone._)\n And shall I see him then, see my Hamilcar,\n Pride of my soul, and lord of all my wishes?The only man in all our burning Afric\n Who ever taught my bosom how to love!If at his name I feel these strange emotions,\n How shall I see, how meet my conqueror?O let not those presume to judge of joy\n Who ne'er have felt the pangs which absence gives.Such tender transport those alone can prove,\n Who long, like me, have known disastrous love;\n The tears that fell, the sighs that once were paid,\n Like grateful incense on his altar laid;\n The lambent flame rekindle, not destroy,\n And woes remember'd heighten present joy.SCENE--_The inside of the Temple of Bellona--Seats for the\n Senators and Ambassadors--Lictors guarding the entrance._\n\n MANLIUS, PUBLIUS, _and Senators_._Man._ Let Regulus be sent for to our presence;\n And with him the ambassador of Carthage.Is it then true the foe would treat of peace?_Pub._ They wish, at least, our captives were exchang'd,\n And send my father to declare their wish:\n If he obtain it, well: if not, then Regulus\n Returns to meet the vengeance of the foe,\n And pay for your refusal with his blood:\n He ratified this treaty with his oath,\n And ere he quitted Carthage, heard, unmov'd,\n The dreadful preparations for his death,\n Should he return.Say, can you give up Regulus to Carthage?_Man._ Peace, Publius, peace, for see thy father comes._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ REGULUS.I thought these walls had been well known to Regulus?I was thinking what I was\n When last I saw them, and what now I am._Ham._ (_to the Consul._)\n Carthage by me to Rome this greeting sends,\n That wearied out at length with bloody war,\n If Rome inclines to peace she offers it.Come, Regulus, resume thine ancient place.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office._Reg._ (_pointing to the Senators._) Who then are these?I'm her Consul;\n Hast thou so soon forgotten Manlius?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden._Reg._ And shall a _slave_ then have a place in Rome\n Among her Consuls and her Senators?_Man._ Yes!--For her _heroes_ Rome forgets her _laws_;\n Softens their harsh austerity for thee,\n To whom she owes her conquests and her triumphs._Reg._ Rome may forget,", "question": "Where is Sandra?

busy, ambitious and\nwould-be wicked little pioneer town.The town and plain lay bathed in\na soft haze of rosy purple that lent a kind of Oriental splendor to\nthe tawdry, unsightly cluster of shacks that sprawled here and there in\nirregular bunches on the prairie.\"How wonderful this great plain\nwith its encircling rivers, those hills with the great peaks beyond!\"There is no finer,\" replied

fell the hissing lash.\"Stand up to them, you beggars!\"he shouted to his bronchos, which\nseemed intent upon turning tail and joining the approaching cavalcade.he yelled, standing up in his

town in open day just now.All Indians will look to you\nlike old Copperhead for a while.\"The little town of Calgary stands on one of the most beautiful\ntown-sites in all the world.A great plain with ramparts of hills on\nevery side, encircled by the twin mountain rivers, the Bow and the\nElbow, overlooked by rolling hills and far away to the west by the\nmighty peaks of the Rockies, it holds at once ample space and unusual\npicturesque beauty.The little town itself was just emerging from its\nearly days as a railway construction-camp and was beginning to develop\nambitions toward a well-ordered business activity and social stability.It was an all-night town, for the simple and sufficient reason that its\ncommunications with the world lying to the east and to the west began\nwith the arrival of No.2 at half-past twelve at night and No.Few of its citizens thought it worth while\nto settle down for the night until after the departure of No.Through this \"all-night\" little town Cameron and the doctor took their\nway.The sidewalks were still thronged, the stores still doing business,\nthe restaurants, hotels, pool-rooms all wide open.It kept\nSergeant Crisp busy enough running out the \"tin-horn\" gamblers and\nwhisky-peddlers, keeping guard over the fresh and innocent lambs\nthat strayed in from the East and across from the old land ready for\nshearing, and preserving law and order in this hustling frontier town.Money was still easy in the town, and had Sergeant Crisp been minded\nfor the mere closing of his eyes or turning of his back upon occasion he\nmight have retired early from the Force with a competency.Unhappily for\nSergeant Crisp, however, there stood in the pathway of his fortune the\nawkward fact of his conscience and his oath of service.Consequently\nhe was forced to grub along upon the munificent bounty of the daily pay\nwith which Her Majesty awarded the faithful service of the non-coms.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the\nPresident, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to\nallude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,\nhad once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He\nsuggests that Congress should remember his services.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine's letter about\n     Dederick's attempt on his life.\"But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take\nit will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been\na volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from\nanything I have published in America or Europe.I have relinquished all\nprofits that those publications might come cheap among the people for\nwhom they were intended--Yours in friendship.\"This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been\nreceived.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on \"The cause of the Yellow\nFever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with\nit Addressed to the Board of Health in America.\"The treatise, which he\ndates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out\nthat the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been\nunknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not\nreach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease\ncertainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from\nNew York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of\nthe wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the\nWest Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves\nwere built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the\nshore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter\ndecaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of\narches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder's Hook and on the\nNorth River.Francis justly remarks, in his \"Old New York,\" that Paine's writings\nwere usually suggested by some occasion.Besides this instance of the\nessay on the yellow fever, he mentions one on the origin of Freemasonry,\nthere being an agitation in New York concerning that fraternity.But this essay---in which Paine, with ingenuity and

and while the vulgar bigots were binding him\non their rock of ages, and tearing his vitals, most of the educated, the\nsocial leaders, were too prudent to manifest any sympathy they may have\nfelt.**\n\n     * When Paine first reached New York, 1803, he was (March\n     5th) entertained at supper by John Crauford.For being\n     present Eliakira Ford, a Baptist elder, was furiously\n     denounced, as were others of the company.** An exception was the leading Presbyterian, John Mason,\n     who lived to denounce Channing as \"the devil's disciple.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Grant Thorbura was psalm-singer in this Scotch preacher's\n     church.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Curiosity to see the lion led Thorburn to visit\n     Paine, for which he was \"suspended.\"Thorburn afterwards\n     made amends by fathering Cheetham's slanders of Paine after\n     Cheetham had become too infamous to quote.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.It were unjust to suppose that Paine met with nothing but abuse and\nmaltreatment from ministers of serious orthodoxy in New York.They had\nwarmly opposed his views, even denounced them, but the controversy seems\nto have died away until he took part in the deistic propaganda of Elihu\nPalmer.'Fellows (July 31st) shows Paine much\ninterested in the \"cause\":\n\n\"I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.I enclose a letter I received a few days since from\nGroton, in Connecticut The letter is well written, and with a good deal\nof sincere enthusiasm.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.The publication of it would do good, but there is\nan impropriety in publishing a man's name to a private letter.You\nmay show the letter to Palmer and Foster....

but these were unfortunately bestowed on such\nextinct subjects as Freemasonry, the secret of Junius, and controversies\nconcerning General Putnam.It is much to be regretted that Colonel\nFellows should not have left a volume concerning Paine, with whom he was\nin especial intimacy, during his last years.Other friends of Paine were Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton, a lawyer,\nand Judge Hertell, a man of wealth, and a distinguished member of the\nState Assembly.Fulton also was much in New York, and often called on\nPaine.Paine was induced to board at the house of William Carver (36\nCedar Street), which proved a grievous mistake.Carver had introduced\nhimself to Paine, saying that he remembered him when he was an exciseman\nat Lewes, England, he (Carver) being a young farrier there.He made loud\nprofessions of deism, and of devotion to Paine.The farrier of Lewes\nhad become a veterinary practitioner and shopkeeper in New York.Paine supposed that he would be cared for in the house of this active\nrationalist, but the man and his family were illiterate and vulgar.His sojourn at Carver's probably shortened Paine's life.Carver, to\nanticipate the narrative a little, turned out to be a bad-hearted man\nand a traitor.Paine had accumulated a mass of fragmentary writings on religious\nsubjects, and had begun publishing them in a journal started in 1804\nby Elihu Palmer,--_The Prospect; or View of the Moral World_.This\nsucceeded the paper called _The Temple of Reason_.One of Paine's\nobjects was to help the new journal, which attracted a good deal of\nattention.His first communication (February 18, 1804), was on a sermon\nby Robert Hall, on \"Modern Infidelity,\" sent him by a gentleman in New\nYork.The following are some of its trenchant paragraphs:\n\n\"Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and\nhow is it proved?If a God he could not die, and as a man he could not\nredeem: how then is this redemption proved to be fact?It is said that\nAdam eat of the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby\nsubjected himself and all his posterity forever to eternal damnation.This is worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children\nunto the third and fourth generations.But how was the death of Jesus\nChrist to affect or alter the case?If so,\nwould it not have been better to have crucified Adam upon the forbidden\ntree, and made a new man?\"\"Why do not the Christians, to be consistent, make Saints of Judas and\nPontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the act of\nsalvation.The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it,\nwas never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the\nsacrifice--and therefore Judas and Pilate ought to stand first in the\ncalendar of Saints.\"Other contributions to the _Prospect_ were: \"Of the word Religion\";\n\"Cain and Abel\"; \"The Tower of Babel\"; \"Of the religion of Deism\ncompared with the Christian Religion\"; \"Of the Sabbath Day in\nConnecticut\"; \"Of the Old and New Testaments\"; \"Hints towards forming a\nSociety for inquiring into the truth or falsehood of ancient history,\nso far as history is connected with systems of religion ancient and\nmodern\";

and she gave an order, by a sharp whistle, to an officer that\nstood near, who immediately disappeared.In a few moments, he returned,\nbringing with him a native dressed very coarsely in white cotton cloth,\nand who carried an empty jar, or water tank, upon his head.He was\nevidently a laborer, and, judging from the low obeisances he constantly\nmade, much to the amusement of the courtiers standing around, I am\nsatisfied that he never before in his whole life had been admitted to\nthe presence of his sovereign.Making a gesture to the officer who had introduced him, he spoke a few\nlow words to the native, who immediately turned toward me, and uttered,\nslowly and distinctly, the following sentence:\n\n\"Ix-itl hua-atl zi-petl poppicobatl.\"Several other attempts to communicate with\nme were made, both by the Princess and the interpreter, but all to no\npurpose.I could neither understand the melodies nor the jargon.But I\nnoticed throughout all these proceedings that there seemed to be two\nentirely distinct modes of expression; the first by whistling, and the\nsecond by utterance.The idea at once flashed across my mind, that there\nwere two languages used in the country--one sacred to the blood royal\nand the nobility, and the other used by the common people.Imp", "question": "Where is Mary?

and when but a boy, on the shores of the distant\nAlbemarle, I had often listened, till long after midnight, to the\nwonderful loquacity of the common mocking-bird, as she poured forth her\nsummer strains.Who has not heard the turtle dove wooing her mate in\ntones that were only not human, because they were more sadly beautiful?Many a belated traveler has placed his hand upon his sword-hilt, and\nlooked suspiciously behind him, as the deep bass note of the owl has\nstartled the dewy air.The cock's crow has become a synonym for a paean\nof triumph.Remembering all those varieties in sound that the air is capable of,\nwhen _cut_, as it were, by whistling, I no longer doubted that a\nlanguage could easily be constructed by analyzing the several tones and\ngiving value to their different modulations.The ludicrousness of the idea soon gave place to admiration, and before\nI had been domiciliated in the palace of the Princess a month, I had\nbecome perfectly infatuated with her native language, and regarded it as\nthe most beautiful and expressive ever spoken by man.And now, after\nseveral years have elapsed since its melodious accents have fallen upon\nmy ears, I hesitate not to assert that for richness and variety of tone,\nfor force and depth of expression, for harmony and sweetness--in short,\nfor all those characteristics that give beauty and strength to spoken\nthought--the royal tongue of the aboriginal Americans is without a\nrival.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.For many days after my mysterious appearance in the midst of the great\ncity I have described, my fate still hung in the balance.I was examined\nand re-examined a hundred times as to the mode of my entrance into the\nvalley; but I always persisted in making the same gestures, and pointed\nto the sky as the region whence I had descended.The guards stationed at\nevery avenue of entrance and exit were summoned to the capital, and\nquestioned closely as to the probability of my having passed them\nunawares; but they fully exculpated themselves from all blame, and were\nrestored to their forfeited posts.Gradually the excitement in the city subsided, and one by one the great\nnobles were won over to credit the story of my celestial arrival in\ntheir midst, and I believed the great object of my existence in a fair\nway to be accomplished.Every facility was afforded me to learn the royal tongue, and after a\nlittle more than a year's residence in the palace, I spoke it with\nconsiderable fluency and accuracy.But all my efforts hitherto were vain to obtain a key to the\nhieroglyphics.Not only was the offense capital to teach their alphabet\nto a stranger, but equally so to natives themselves, unconnected with\nthe blood royal.With all my ingenuity and industry, I had not advanced\na single letter.One night, as I lay tossing restlessly upon my bed, revolving this\ninsoluble enigma in my mind, one of the mosaic paving-stones was\nsuddenly lifted up in the middle of the room, and the figure of a young\nman with a lighted taper in his hand stood before me.Raising my head hastily from the pillow, I almost sank back with\nastonishment when I recognized in the form and features of my midnight\nvisitor, Pio the Carib boy.\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\n       Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"I sprang to my feet with all the eagerness of joy, and was about to rush\ninto the arms of Pio, when he suddenly checked my enthusiasm by\nextinguishing the light.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.I stood still and erect, like one petrified\ninto stone.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.That moment I felt a hand upon my arm, then around my waist,\nand ere I could collect my thoughts, was distinctly lifted from the\nground.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.On touching the floor with\nmy feet, I was planted firmly, and the arms of my companion were tightly\ndrawn around my own so as to prevent me from raising them.The next\ninstant, and the stone upon which we stood suddenly slid from its\nposition, and gradually sank perpendicularly,--we still retaining our\nposition upon it.Our descent was not rapid, nor did I deem it very secure; for the\ntrap-door trembled under us, and more than once seemed to touch the\nshaft into which we were descending.A few moments more and we landed\nsecurely upon a solid pavement.My companion then disengaged his hold,\nand stepping off a few paces, pronounced the words \"_We are here_!\"in\nthe royal tongue, and immediately a panel slid from the side of the\napartment, and a long passage-way, lighted at the further end by a\nsingle candle, displayed itself to view.Into that passage we at once\nentered, and without exchanging a single word, walked rapidly toward the\nlight.The light stood upon a stone stand about four feet high, at the\nintersection of these passages.We took the one to the left, and\nadvanced twenty or thirty yards, when Pio halted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.On coming up to him,\nhe placed his mouth close to the wall, and exclaimed as before.A huge block of granite swung inward, and we entered a small but\nwell-lighted apartment, around which were hanging several costly and\nmagnificent suits of Palenquin costume.Hastily seizing two of them, Pio commenced arraying himself in one, and\nrequested me by a gesture to don the other.With a little assistance, I\nsoon found myself decked from head to foot in a complete suit of regal\nrobes--_panache_, sash, and sandals inclusive.When all was completed, Pio, for the first time, addressed me as\nfollows: \"Young stranger, whoever you may be, or to whatever nation you\nmay belong, matters but little to me.The attendant guardian spirit of\nour race and country has conducted you hither, in the most mysterious\nmanner, and now commands me to have you instructed in the most sacred\nlore of the Aztecs.Your long residence in this palace has fully\nconvinced you of the danger to which we are both exposed;

and I was again reminded of the great mathematician before the\nassembly broke up, and of his reply to that King of Sicily, who inquired\nif there were no easy way of acquiring mathematics.\"None, your\nHighness,\" replied the philosopher; \"there is no royal road to\nlearning.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Labor, I soon found, was the only price, even amongst the\nAztecs, at which knowledge could be bought.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Each student was furnished\nwith the same species of instruments which the old man before-mentioned\nheld in his hands.The one held in the left hand resembled a white porcelain slate, only\nbeing much larger than those in common use.It was nearly twenty inches\nsquare, and was divided by mathematical lines into thirty-six\ncompartments.It was covered over with a thin crystal, resembling glass,\nwhich is found in great quantities in the neighboring mountains, and is\nperfectly transparent.The crystal was raised about the one eighth of an\ninch from the surface of the slate, and allowed a very fine species of\nblack sand to move at will between them.The instrument carried in the\nright hand resembled the bow of a common violin, more than anything\nelse.The outer edge was constructed of a beautiful yellow wood,\npolished, and bent into the arc of a quarter circle; whilst a mass of\nsmall cords, made of the native hemp, united the two ends.The method of using the bow was this: The slate was shaken violently\nonce or twice, so as to distribute the black sand equally over the white\nsurface, and then the bow was drawn perpendicularly down the edge of the\nslate, very rapidly, so as to produce a quick whistling sound.The\neffect produced upon the grains of sand was truly wonderful to the\nuninitiated in the laws of acoustics.They arranged themselves into\npeculiar figures, sometimes in the form of a semicircle, sometimes into\nthat of a spiral, sometimes into a perfect circle, or a cone, or a\nrhomboid, or an oval, dependent entirely upon two things: first, the\nplace where the slate was held by the left hand; and second, the point\nwhere the bow was drawn across the edge.As the slate was subdivided\ninto thirty-six compartments, by either one of which it could be held,\nand as there was a corresponding point, across which the bow could be\ndrawn, there were seventy-two primitive sounds that might be produced by\nmeans of this simple contrivance.Each of these sounds inherently and\nnecessarily produced a different figure upon the slate, and there were\nconsequently just seventy-two initial letters in the Aztec alphabet.A word was pronounced by\nthe aged teacher at the front of the stage, written upon his slate,\nexhibited to the scholar at the black tablet, and by him copied upon it.The whole class then drew down their bows, so as to produce the proper\nsound, and the word itself, or its initial letter, was immediately\nformed upon the slate.After the seventy-two primitive letters or sounds had been learned, the\nnext step was the art of combining them, so as not only to produce\nsingle words, but very often whole sentences.Thus the first\nhieroglyphic carved upon the tablet, on the back wall of the altar, in\nCasa No.3 (forming the frontispiece of the second volume of Stephens's\nTravels in Central America), expresses, within itself, the name, date of\nbirth, place of nativity, and parentage, of _Xixencotl_, the first king\nof the twenty-third dynasty of the Aztecs.The hieroglyphics of the Aztecs are all of them both symbolical and\nphonetic.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.Hence, in almost every one we observe, first, the primitive\nsound or initial letter, and its various combinations;

and to this day the Cabinet is not\na body recognised by law.As a Privy Councillor, a person is under\nlittle or no responsibility for the acts advised by him, on account of\nthe difficulty of proof.\u201d Lord John Russell \u201casked the House to pause\nbefore it gave assent to the constitutional doctrines laid down by Mr.He unduly restricted the responsibility of Ministers.\u201d... \u201cI\nhold,\u201d continued Lord John, \u201cthat it is not really for the business the\nMinister transacts in performing the particular duties of his office,\nbut it is for any advice which he has given, and which he may be\nproved, before a Committee of this House, or at the bar of the House of\nLords, to have given, that he is responsible, and for which he suffers\nthe penalties that may ensue from impeachment.\u201d\n\nIt is plain that both Mr.Walpole and Lord Russell were here speaking\nof real legal responsibility, such responsibility as might be enforced\nby impeachment or other legal process, not of the vaguer kind of\nresponsibility which is commonly meant when we speak of Ministers being\n\u201cresponsible to the House of Commons.\u201d This last is enforced, not by\nlegal process, but by such motions as that of Sir Robert Peel in 1841,\nor that of the Marquess of Hartington in June 1859.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.I have made my extracts from the Spectator newspaper of February 11,\n1854.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.(12) We read (Anglia Sacra, i.335) of \u00c6thelric, Bishop of the\nSouth-Saxons at the time of the Conquest, as \u201cvir antiquissimus et\nlegum terr\u00e6 sapientissimus.\u201d So Adelelm, the first Norman Abbot of\nAbingdon, found much benefit from the legal knowledge of certain of his\nEnglish monks (Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, ii.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.2), \u201cquibus tanta\nsecularium facundia et pr\u00e6teritorum memoria eventorum inerat, ut c\u00e6teri\ncircumquaque facile eorum sententiam ratam fuisse, quam edicerent,\napprobarent.\u201d The writer adds, \u201cSed et alii plures de Anglis causidici\nper id tempus in abbatia ista habebantur quorum collationi nemo sapiens\nrefragabatur.\u201d But knowledge of the law was not an exclusively clerical\naccomplishment;

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Ashtabula bridge is\nsituated only about 1,000 feet east of the station of the same name,\nand spans a deep ravine, at the bottom of which flows a shallow\nstream, some two or three feet in depth, which empties into Lake\nErie a mile or two away.The bridge was an iron Howe truss of 150\nfeet span, elevated 69 feet above the bottom of the ravine, and\nsupported at either end by solid masonwork abutments.As the train approached the bridge it had\nto force its way through a heavy snow-drift, and, when it passed\nonto it, it was moving at a speed of some twelve or fourteen miles\nan hour.The entire length of the bridge afforded space only for\ntwo of the express cars at most in addition to the locomotives,\nso that when the wheels of the leading locomotive rested on the\nwestern abutment of the bridge nine of the eleven cars which made up\nthe train, including all those in which there were passengers, had\nyet to reach its eastern end.At the instant when the train stood\nin this position, the engineer of the leading locomotive heard a\nsudden cracking sound apparently beneath him, and thought he felt\nthe bridge giving way.Instantly pulling the throttle valve wide\nopen, his locomotive gave a spring forward and, as it did so, the\nbridge fell, the rear wheels of his tender falling with it.The\njerk and impetus of the locomotive, however, sufficed to tear out\nthe coupling, and as his tender was dragged up out of the abyss\nonto the track, though its rear wheels did not get upon the rails,\nthe frightened engineer caught a fearful glimpse of the second\nlocomotive as it seemed to turn and then fall bottom upwards into\nthe ravine.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.The bridge had given way, not at once but by a slowly\nsinking motion, which began at the point where the pressure was\nheaviest, under the two locomotives and at the west abutment.There\nbeing two tracks, and this train being on the southernmost of the\ntwo, the southern truss had first yielded, letting that side of\nthe bridge down, and rolling, as it were, the second locomotive\nand the cars immediately behind it off to the left and quite clear\nof a straight line drawn between the two abutments; then almost\nimmediately the other truss gave way and the whole bridge fell, but\nin doing so swung slightly to the right.Before this took place the\nentire train with the exception of the last two sleepers had reached\nthe chasm, each car as it passed over falling nearer than the one\nwhich had preceded it to the east abutment, and finally the last two\nsleepers came, and, without being deflected from their course at\nall, plunged straight down and fell upon the wreck of the bridge at\nits east end.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.It was necessarily all the work of a few seconds.At the bottom of the ravine the snow lay waist deep and the stream\nwas covered with ice some eight inches in thickness.Upon this\nwere piled up the fallen cars and engine, the latter on top of the\nformer near the western abutment and upside down.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.All the passenger\ncars were heated by stoves.At first a dead silence seemed to\nfollow the successive shocks of the falling mass.In less than\ntwo minutes, however, the fire began to show itself and within\nfifteen the holocaust was at its height.As usual, it was a mass of\nhuman beings, all more or less stunned, a few killed, many injured\nand helpless, and more yet simply pinned down to watch, in the\npossession as full as helpless of all their faculties, the rapid\napproach of the flames.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.The number of those killed outright seems\nto have been surprisingly small.In the last car, for instance,\nno one was lost.This was due to the energy and presence of mind\nof the porter, a <DW64> named Steward, who, when he felt the car\nresting firmly on its side, broke a window and crawled through it,\nand then passed along breaking the other windows and extricating\nthe passengers until all were gotten out.Those in the other cars\nwere far less fortunate.Though an immediate alarm had been given\nin the neighboring town, the storm was so violent and the snow so\ndeep that assistance arrived but slowly.Nor when it did arrive\ncould much be effected.The essential thing was to extinguish the\nflames.The means for so doing were close at hand in a steam pump\nbelonging to the railroad company, while an abundance of hose could\nhave been procured at another place but a short distance off.In\nthe excitement and agitation of the moment contradictory orders\nwere given, even to forbidding the use of the pump, and practically\nno effort to extinguish the fire was made.Within half an hour of\nthe accident the flames were at their height, and when the next\nmorning dawned nothing remained in the ravine but a charred and\nundistinguishable mass of car trucks, brake-rods, twisted rails and\nbent and tangled bridge iron, with the upturned locomotive close to\nthe west abutment.In this accident some eighty persons are supposed to have lost\ntheir lives, while over sixty others were injured.The exact number\nof those killed can never be known, however, as more than half of\nthose reported were utterly consumed in the fire; indeed, even of\nthe bodies recovered scarcely one half could be identified.Of the\ncause of the disaster much was said at the time in language most\nunnecessarily scientific;--but little was required to be said.It\nadmitted of no extenuation.An iron bridge, built in the early days\nof iron-bridges,--that which fell under the train at Ashtabula, was\nfaulty in its original construction, and the indications of weakness\nit had given had been distinct, but had not been regarded.That it\nhad stood so long and that it should have given way when it did,\nwere equally matters for surprise.A double track bridge, it should\nnaturally have fallen under the combined pressure of trains moving\nsimultaneously in opposite directions.The strain under which it\nyielded was not a particularly severe one, even taken in connection\nwith the great atmospheric pressure of the storm then prevailing.It was, in short, one of those disasters, fortunately of infrequent\noccurrence, with which accident has little if any connection.It was due to original inexperience and to subsequent ignorance\nor carelessness, or possibly recklessness as criminal as it was\nfool-hardy.Besides being a bridge accident, this was also a stove accident,--in\nthis respect a repetition of Angola.One of the most remarkable\nfeatures about it, indeed, was the fearful rapidity with which\nthe fire spread, and the incidents of its spread detailed in the\nsubsequent evidence of the survivors were simply horrible.Men,\nwomen and children, full of the instinct of self-preservation, were\ncaught and pinned fast for the advancing flames, while those who\ntried to rescue them were driven back by the heat and compelled\nhelplessly to listen to their shrieks.It is, however, unnecessary\nto enter into these details, for they are but the repetition of\nan experience which has often been told, and they do but enforce\na lesson which the railroad companies seem resolved not to learn.Unquestionably the time in this country will come when through\ntrains will be heated from a locomotive or a heating-car.That time,\nhowever, had not yet come.Meanwhile the evidence would seem to show\nthat at Ashtabula, as at Angola, at least two lives were sacrificed\nin the subsequent fire to each one lost in the immediate shock of\nthe", "question": "Where is Daniel?

Rodin seemed to recover from his\nemotion, he said to Dupont: \"One part of my mission, my dear sir--that\nwhich relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet\nanother.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a\ncircumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or\nsixteen years ago, the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in\ngarrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.It was only just now, that I\nwas talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well\nhe could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In\nthe Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in\nthat part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he\nsang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!\"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: \"You\ndoubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious\nBonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny (whose private\nsecretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.\"\"That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and\nflattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,\nnotwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a\ngreat preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain\nabbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are\narchbishops and cardinals.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.M.

now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,\ncommenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to\nthe cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:\n\nShe said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had\nput foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land\nfor a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a\ngreat nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in\nthe bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough\nto contend with them was sure to be brought into subjection, if not\nutterly destroyed.Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for\nbravery.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted\nas much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land\nwas overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was\nbecause they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to\nthem in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal\nchiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit\nwould speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,\nevery thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said\nhe would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him\nthat they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if\nhe persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and\ntold them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great\nSpirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose\nof frightening him.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a\ngreat brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to\nhim, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country\nof all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his\nown, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.And then\nhe laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into\nthe magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to\nsay.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came\nout sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,\nand his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation\nscattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.And he collected another great army, and went to war again.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.But by\nthis time the other nations, seeing the danger they were in, united\nagainst him as a common enemy.He was overthrown, killed, and his army entirely cut to pieces.The conquering army now entered this country, and laid it waste, as\ntheirs had been laid waste before.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.And the war was carried on for many years, until the prophesy was\nfulfilled that had been spoken by the Great Spirit, and the people of\nthis once mighty nation were scattered to the four winds.This people as a great nation are known no longer, but a remnant still\nremains scattered among the other tribes.Occasionally some of them\nvisit this cave, to whom alone its mysteries are known, or were,\nLightfoot said, until she had brought Captain Flint there in order to\nescape their pursuers.\"Is the voice of the Great Spirit ever heard here now?\"Lightfoot said the voice of the Great Spirit had never been heard\nthere since the destruction of his favorite nation, but that the\nspirits of the braves as he had said before, did sometimes come back\nfrom the spirit-land to speak comfort to the small remnant of the\nfriends who still remained upon the earth.This narrative of the Indian woman somewhat satisfied the curiosity of\nHellena, but it did not quiet her fears, and to be imprisoned in a\ndreary cavern haunted by spirits, for aught she knew, demons, was to\nher imagination, about as terrible a situation as she could possibly\nbe placed in.CHAPTER X.\n\n\nWhen there were none of the pirates in the cave, it was the custom of\nLightfoot, and Hellena to spread their couch in the body of the\ncavern, and there pass the night.Such was the case on the night\nfollowing the day on which Lightfoot had related to Hellena the sad\nhistory of her people.It is hardly to be expected that the young girl's sleep would be very\nsound that night, with her imagination filled with visions, hob\ngoblins of every form, size, and color.During the most of the forepart of the night she lay awake thinking\nover the strange things she had heard concerning the cave, and\nexpecting every moment to see some horrible monster make its\nappearance in the shape of an enormous", "question": "Where is Daniel?

particularly the\nweapons belonging to the pirates, which seemed particularly to take\nhis fancy.But he carefully replaces everything after having examined\nit.He now approaches the place where the two women are lying.The figure approached the couch; for a moment he bent over it and\ngazed intently on the two women; particularly on that of the white\nmaiden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.When having apparently satisfied his curiosity, he withdrew as\nstealthily as he had come.When Hellena opened her eyes again, the spectre had vanished, and\neverything about the cave appeared as if nothing unusual had happened.For a long time she lay quietly thinking over the strange occurrences\nof the night.She was in doubt whether scenes which she had witnessed\nwere real, or were only the empty creations of a dream.The horrible\nspectres which she had seen in the fore part of the night seemed like\nthose which visit us in our dreams when our minds are troubled.But\nthe apparition of the Indian seemed more real.or were the two\nscenes only different parts of one waking vision?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.To this last opinion she seemed most inclined, and was fully confirmed\nin the opinion that the cavern was haunted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.Although Hellena was satisfied in her own mind that the figure that\nhad appeared so strangely was a disembodied spirit, yet she had a\nvague impression that she had somewhere seen that form before.But\nwhen, or where, she could not recollect.When in the morning she related the occurrences of the night to\nLightfoot, the Indian expressed no surprise, and exhibited no alarm.Nor did she attempt to offer any explanation seeming to treat it as a\nmatter of course.Although this might be unsatisfactory to Hellena in some respects, it\nwas perhaps after all, quite as well for her that Lightfoot did not\nexhibit any alarm at what had occurred, as by doing so she imparted\nsome of her own confidence to her more timid companion.All this while Black Bill had not been thought of but after a while he\ncrawled out from his bunk, his eyes twice their usual size, and coming\nup to Hellena, he said:\n\n\"Misses, misses, I seed do debble last night wid a great fire-brand in\nhis hand, and he went all round de cabe, lookin' for massa Flint, to\nburn him up, but he couldn't fine him so he went away agin.Now I know\nhe's comin' after massa Flint, cause he didn't touch nobody else.\"\"No; but I kept mighty still, and shut my eyes when he come to look at\nme, but he didn't say noffen, so I know'd it wasn't dis darkey he was\nafter.\"This statement of the <DW64>'s satisfied Hellena that she had not been\ndreaming when she witnessed the apparition of the Indian.On further questioning Bill, she found he had not witnessed any of the\nhorrid phantoms that had visited her in her dreams.As soon as Hellena could do so without attracting attention, she took\na lamp and examined the walls in every direction to see if she could\ndiscover any where a crevice large enough for a person to pass\nthrough, but she could find nothing of the sort.The walls were rough and broken in many parts, but there was nothing\nlike what she was in search of.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.She next questioned Lightfoot about it, asking her if there was any\nother entrance to the cave beside the one through which they had\nentered.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.But the Indian woman gave her no satisfaction, simply telling her that\nshe might take the lamp and examine for herself.As Hellena had already done this, she was of course as much in the\ndark as ever.When Captain Flint visited the cave again as he did on the following\nday, Hellena would have related to him the occurrences of the previous\nnight, but she felt certain that he would only laugh at it as\nsomething called up by her excited imagination, or treat it as a story\nmade up for the purpose of exciting his sympathy.Or perhaps invented for the purpose of arousing his superstition in\norder to make him leave the cave, and take her to some place where\nescape would be more easy.So she concluded to say nothing to him about it.About a week after the occurrence of the events recorded in the last\nchapter, Captain Flint and his crew were again assembled in the\ncavern.It was past midnight, and they evidently had business of\nimportance before them, for although the table was spread as upon the\nformer occasion, the liquors appeared as yet to be untasted, and\ninstead of being seated around the table, the whole party were sitting\non skins in a remote corner of the cavern, and conversing in a\nsuppressed tone of voice as if fearful of being heard.\"Something must be done,\" said one of the men, \"to quiet this darn\nsuspicion, or it's all up with us.\"\"I am for leaving at once,\" said Old Ropes; \"the only safety for us\nnow is in giving our friends the slip, and the sooner we are out of\nthese waters the better it will be for us.\"\"What, and leave the grand prize expecting to take care of itself?\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.\"Darn the prize,\" said Old Ropes, \"the East Indiaman ain't expected\nthis two weeks yet, and if the suspicions agin us keep on increasin'\nas they have for the last ten days, the land pirates'll have us all\nstrung up afore the vessel arrives.\"This opinion was shared by the majority of the men.Even the Parson\nwho took delight in opposing Old Ropes in almost every thing, agreed\nwith him here.\"Whether or not,\" said he, \"I am afraid to face death in a fair\nbusiness-like way, you all know, but as sure as I'm a genuine parson,\nI'd rather be tortured to death by a band of savage Indians, than to\nbe strung up to a post with my feet dangling in the air to", "question": "Where is Mary?

must be allowed to escape, as that would\nexpose the trick.\"All this must take place while I am known to be on shore, and the\nschooner lying in port.\"This plot, which was worthy the invention of a

when \"liberty of blood\" is mentioned, what\nis meant by \"liberty of arteries\"?\"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic\nligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation.\"Some Osteopaths and other\ntherapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used\n\"big words\" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of\nthe one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,\ntechnical terms and \"high-sounding nothings\" used by so many Osteopathic\nwriters.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,\nPh.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general\npublic in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify\ngreat truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If\nwriters for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying\nand popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on\nOsteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary\nis taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and\nmotives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading\npromoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be\nwithheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in\nKansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He\nwas at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.During the Civil War\nhe was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the\nwar that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something\nnatural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by\nhis profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the\ndiscovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of\nKirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had\nimplicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious\nmovements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn\ntoward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Others began to desire Still's\nhealing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,\nwhich from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and\nequipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated\nyearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been\nfounded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number\nof schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the\ncountry.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and\nthis number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians\nthan are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic\nreports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable\nlegal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I\nshall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and\nwomen who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater\nimportance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide\nwhich system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their\nlives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one\ninjustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the\ncause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents\nthe sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of\ntelling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this \"new science\" of\nhealing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes\nbold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of\npractitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy\nfor disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of\nOsteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that\nsince the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are\nso blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the\npractice of Osteopathy.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic\ncollege that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim\nmyself as an exponent of a \"complete and well-rounded system of healing,\nadequate for every emergency,\" as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the\njournals published for \"Osteopathic physicians\" to scatter broadcast among\nthe people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an\nOsteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility\nfor human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the\ncase as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy\nwould cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been\ncalled a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not\npractice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and \"subluxated,\" and tell\npeople that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five\ndollars per month, to have one or two \"subluxations\" corrected.In\nconsequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the\nliterature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to\nall \"Osteopathic physicians\" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies\nof Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with\nsome of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor\nof an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This\neditor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in\nwhich he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,\nas I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as\nhe acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.", "question": "Where is Daniel?

disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am\nwriting.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I\nbelieve, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large\nnumber of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all\nthat makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say\nthat they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing\nnumber.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of\nthe small per cent.It may not be\nknown how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in\nthe meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a\nstore, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic\nphysicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no\nreason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who\nhave quit in the entire country.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,\nstarted out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was\npointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath\nfrom the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance\nbill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a\nchain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,\nabout eight hundred of them, of \"mossbacks,\" as we were politely called.I\nsay \"we,\" for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the\nnames of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could\nbe had with them.Just for what, aside\nfrom the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not\nclear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,\nand do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals\nare continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the\n\"Who's Who in Osteopathy\" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is\nnot strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic\njournals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those\nwho choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students\nshould know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational\n    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in

and\npopularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing\nsystem.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people\nare so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The \"perfect\nadjustment,\" \"perfect functioning\" theory of Osteopathy is especially\nattractive to people made ripe for some \"drugless healing\" system by\ncauses already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of\nall manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative\npowers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such\ngood results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will\nestablish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and\nholds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,\ntaught as \"a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,\"\nhas grown and spread largely as a \"patent medicine\" flourishes, _i.e._,\nin exact proportion to the advertising it has received.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.I would not\npresume to make this statement as merely my opinion.The question at issue\nis too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present\nfacts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.Every week I get booklets or \"sample copies\" of journals heralding the\nwonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as\njournals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by\nthe hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution\nby these patients to their friends.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.The publishers of these \"boosters\"\nsay, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their\npractice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of\nthese journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:\n\n    \"Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me\n    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite\n    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their\n    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter\nopposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it\nbecause \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.At one time I honestly\nbelieved this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic\nauthority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract\nfrom a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic\nAssociation:\n\n    \"Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy

their old leaders, the fools\nor scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the\ndesolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure\nfor their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it\nprofitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep\nplaced themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being\nmobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets\nwithout any serious trouble.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Towards the latter part of one evening\nBarrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly\nafterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening\nto the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the\nhill--the man with the scar on his forehead.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.The crowd was applauding\nhim loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen\nthis man before.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no\nreference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington\nexamined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they\nhad met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of\nthe Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town\nthat Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man\nwho had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a\nstone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man\nwho had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man\nwore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the\nshade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,\nand Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak\nto him.All around them, pandemonium reigned supreme.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.They were in the\nvicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,\nwhere several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,\nand a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the\npavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by\ntwo or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they\ncarried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance\nof getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid\nspeakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile\ncrowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and\nvice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,\nsinging, 'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland' or 'good ole\nSweater', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of\nhooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,\ncursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the\npavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against\nwalls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic\nimbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of\nthe church chimes,\n\n        'Good--ole--Sweat--er\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er.'Other groups--to the same tune--sang 'Good--ole--Close--land'; and\nevery now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat\neach other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about\nthe respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed\nin every line the contempt of those who published them for the\nintelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was\none Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house;

who knows the only remedy, and knows\nthat that remedy--the state of society that will be called\nSocialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the\nextermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not\nfollow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of\nknowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order\nto help to bring that state of society into being.When I first\nacquired that knowledge,' he continued, bitterly, 'I was eager to tell\nthe good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health\nin order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it\nwillingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,\nand that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there's no\nneed to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself\nin order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing\nevil.If you don't want to help to bring about a better state of\naffairs, there's no reason why you should help to perpetuate the\npresent system.''Oh yes, there is, and a very good\nreason too.''I don't think you could show me a reason,' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless\nlaugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again\nfull of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I\npossess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach\nthem how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they\nmight save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did\nnot want them to give me money.And they paid me\nwith hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to\nrob them, they have treated me with respect.'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money\nto his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of\nthem howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,\nothers standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of\nintelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words\nconvey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes\ngleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for\nan opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal\nnatures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of\nblood!Can't you see that these people, whom you are trying to make\nunderstand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine\nof universal brotherhood and love are for the most\npart--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they\nfeel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of\ncourse--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to\nWork.'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are\nthe people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just\nas well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason\nwith them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get\nbetter conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are\nthe enemy you will have to fight against.They'll hate you, and, if\nthey get the chance, they'll tear you to pieces.But if you're a\nsensible man you'll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess\nfor your own benefit.Don't think about Socialism or any other \"ism\".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn't matter how you get\nit, but--get it.If you can't get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but\nget it!and then they'll have some respect for you.''There's something in what you say,' replied Barrington, after a long\npause, 'but it's not all.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.Circumstances make us what we are; and\nanyhow, the children are worth fighting for.''You may think so now,' said the other, 'but you'll come to see it my\nway some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to\nlet them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don't\nsee why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to\nreason,' he continued after a pause, 'I can put you on to something\nthat will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.''Look here: you're a Socialist; well, I'm a Socialist too: that is, I\nhave sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable\nand right; it will come when the majority of the people are\nsufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will\nnever be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these\npeople are simply not intellectually capable of abstract\nreasoning--they can't grasp theories.You know what the late Lord\nSalisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free\nlibraries: He said: \"They don't want libraries: give them a circus.\"You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they\nhave to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies\nof grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is\nwhy it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and\nthat's where you make a mistake--you're simply wasting your time.'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means\nof object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing\nnumbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson\nwhich demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in\ntime compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt\nthat, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from\ntheoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,\nand then, and not", "question": "Where is John?

there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,' he said\nslowly at last, 'but it seems to me that you do not make enough\nallowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have\nbeen taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own\nclass with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who\npossess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they\nare really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their\nso-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different\nfrom them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ\nfrom each other, and inferior to them only because they have been\ndeprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I\ndo that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.'The self-styled \"Christian\" priests who say--with their tongues in\ntheir cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,\nhave succeeded in convincing the majority of the \"brethren\" that it is\ntheir duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves\nlowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be\ndirected against the deceivers, not against the dupes.''Well, go and try to undeceive them,' he said, as he returned to the\nplatform in response to a call from his associates.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.'Go and try to\nteach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness\nfor the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to\nthem that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not\nbecause of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed\nof their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that\ninheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful\nthey'll be to you.'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a\ndispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have\ntaken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,\nbut the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and\nafter a while he discontinued it.Like\none awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a\ndifferent light.\u201cRedfern,\u201d said Havens, as coolly as if he had been sitting at his

serve your purpose until you are ready to come to\nterms.\u201d\n\nHe pointed toward the two prisoners, and the men by his side advanced\nwith cords in their hands.Havens extended his wrists with a smile on\nhis face and Sam did likewise.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity we can\u2019t come to\nterms!\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that!\u201d replied Havens.\u201cGo on with your program.\u201d\n\nRedfern walked back to the corridor and the prisoners heard him\ndismissing some one for the night.\u201cYou may go to bed now,\u201d he said.The two\nmen with me will care for the prisoners.\u201d\n\nThe party passed down a stone corridor to the door of a room which had\nevidently been used as a fortress dungeon in times past.Redfern turned\na great key in the lock and motioned the prisoners inside.At that moment he stood facing the prisoners with the two others at his\nsides, all looking inquiringly into the faces of those who were taking\ntheir defeat so easily.As Redfern swung his hand toward the open door he felt something cold\npressing against his neck.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.He turned about to face an automatic revolver\nheld in the hands of Ben Whitcomb!His two accomplices moved forward a\npace in defense, but drew back when they saw the automatic in Jimmie\u2019s\nhand within a foot of their breasts.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.Havens, as

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Grand\nCommander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an\nimmense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the\ncandidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come.The scheme\nof bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular\nduring the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been\noriginal with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the\nmany atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order.Some time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the\norder from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St.Among the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf.Burnett of\nCincinnati, and Gov.They arrived at\nthe lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall\nof the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them.The visitors\nwere arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads,\nand looked more like the prisoners in the play of \"Lucretia Borgia\"\nthan members of modern civilization.On the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha\nFalls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole.This\norganization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour\none of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev.John Penman\nto consent to become one of its members.Penman was so highly\nIndignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the\ninitiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work,\nwith numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper's Weekly.The exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines,\nand ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented\na dark and gloomy appearance.The reverend gentleman was judge of\nprobate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly\ndiminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his\nadvantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never\ncherished much love for each other.The ravings of the Eatanswill\nGazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little\npapers in describing the shortcomings of their \"vile and reptile\ncontemporary.\"After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known\nthat the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the\nmanagers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively\ncampaign for the office of state printer.Both papers had worked hard\nfor the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims\non the party for recognition.Both offices were badly in need of\nfinancial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful\none of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend.How to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the\nproblem that confronted the legislature about to assemble.The war of\nwords between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity.The\neditor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times\nas \"Mr.Timothy Muggins Newson\"--his right name being Thomas M.\nNewson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr.Foster as the\n\"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian.\"To effect a\nreconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic\ntalent of the party leaders.After frequent consultations between the\nleading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was\narranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the\npaper should be the Minnesotian and Times.It can readily be seen\nthat a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was\nnot likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity.The\nrelations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one\nmanagement than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate.This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature\nadjourned, when the partnership was dissolved.Foster assumed\nentire control of the Minnesotian and Maj.Foster in the\npublication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when\nthe offices separated it was stipulated that Mr.Moore should have the\nprinting of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part\npayment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson,\nMoore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the\npaper he helped to found.After the arrangement was made it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville\nBrown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state\nprinter and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that\nvillage.Newson until\nthe first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.Marshall\nand Thomas F.

I made the fellow give it up.\"There was a listener to what passed between the two children.A tall\nlady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively.She was evidently revolving some plan in her head.As Dan was about\nturning away, she placed her hand on his arm.\"Young man,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you.\"\"All right, ma'am,\" said Dan, surprised.Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to\nsend him on an errand, and his surprise vanished.She was tall, slender,\nand grave in appearance.\"Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?\"\"There is only one of me,\" answered Dan, humorously.\"If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.\"\"Yes,\" answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be\nonly curiosity on the part of the lady.She noticed at once the change\nin his manner.\"I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity,\" she said, quickly.\"All right, ma'am,\" he said; \"I am ready to answer.\"\"Are you at leisure for an hour or two?\"\"I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper,\" he\nsaid, hesitating.\"Can't you send her a message not to expect you?Does this little girl\nknow where you live?\"\"Little girl,\" she said, \"go at once and tell this boy's mother that he\nwill not be home till nine o'clock.The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents\nin her hand.As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of\nhim.What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to\nexplain his absence to his mother?\"Now,\" said the lady, \"if you will hail the next stage we will go up\ntown.\"Soon they were rattling over the pavements\nthrough thronged Broadway.It was two years since Dan had been in a\nBroadway stage.He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but\nwhen it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage.Nearly\nopposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his\nside.Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn.Of\ncourse he did not betray any mark of recognition.\"I like riding in a Broadway stage,\" he heard the young lady say.\"There\nis more to see as you go along.\"Not always,\" said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it.\"The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage,\" said the\nyoung lady.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.\"It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.\"\"How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.\"I give it up,\" said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look.\"Yes,\" answered Dan, \"I used to know him.\"\"I don't,\" said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first\ntime that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in\ncompany.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.\"What can they have to do with each other?\"\"She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed.\"At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief.Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a\npolite bow.\"Thank you,\" said the young lady, with a pleasant smile.\"You needn't have troubled yourself,\" said Tom Carver, irritated.\"This\nyoung lady is under _my_ charge.\"\"It is no trouble, I assure you,\" answered Dan.\"He is very polite,\" said the young lady, in a low voice, \"and", "question": "Where is Sandra?

addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise.\"He lives at the Five Points somewhere,\" muttered Tom.The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only\nsmiled in reply.The stage kept on till it reached Madison square.\"Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?\"He got out first, and helped his companion out.\"Follow me into the hotel,\" she

well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady.Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the\nsofa beside her.\"You have already told me that you have no sister,\" she began.\"Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?\"\"I have a little girl under my charge--my niece--from whom, for reasons\nunnecessary to state, I am obliged to part for

be a very desirable arrangement for them.\"Then you feel authorized to accept the charge in your mother's name?\"Your mother would be willing to\nteach her until such time as she may be old enough to go to school?\"\"I think little girls are best off at home until the age of seven or\neight.\"\"We live in a poor room and a poor neighborhood.\"I shall pay you enough to enable you to\ntake better rooms.\"\"I may as well be explicit,\" said the lady.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.\"I propose to pay fifty\ndollars a month for my ward's board, including, of course, your mothers\ncare.\"\"I am afraid it won't be worth it,\" said Dan, frankly.\"If Althea is well cared for, as I am sure she will be, I shall have no\nfear of that.Let me add that I shall allow your mother ten dollars per\nmonth extra for the child's clothing--say sixty dollars in all.For the\npresent that will probably be enough.\"\"Oh, yes, I should think so,\" said Dan.\"When do you want her to come to\nus?\"I must leave New York early to-morrow.In fact, I leave\nthe city by an early train.\"\"She would have to come to our poor lodgings,\" said Dan, hesitatingly.To-morrow you can secure rooms up town.\"\"Now,\" said the lady, rising, \"since the matter is settled, come up\nstairs with me, and I will show you the child.\"Dan followed the lady up stairs, feeling as if he were in a dream, but a\nvery pleasant one.As the lady entered the room a little girl, with an expression of joy,\nran from the window from which she had been looking, and took her hand.\"I'm so glad you've got home, auntie,\" she said.\"I staid away longer than I intended, Althea,\" said the lady.\"I was\nafraid you would feel lonely.\"I wanted to go out into the hall and play with a\nlittle girl that lives in the next room, but I thought you wouldn't find\nme.\"I have brought you a playfellow, Althea.\"This drew the little girl's attention to Dan.Unlike most girls of her\nage, she was not bashful.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Are you going to live with us, Dan?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.\"You are coming to live with me,\" said Dan, smiling.You are nice-looking,\" said Althea, in a\nmatter-of-fact tone.He found the compliment agreeable, though it came from a\nlittle girl.\"So are you, Althea,\" he said.\"I don't think I am,\" said Althea.\"I've black hair, and my skin is\ndark.You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am.\"I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown\noff, but it wouldn't come.\"He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the\nbrilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not.\"You will like to live with Dan, my dear?\"\"I have got to go away--on business.\"\"I don't want you to go away, auntie,\" she said.\"Dan and I can't live\nalone.\"\"Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you.\"asked Althea, brightening up.\"And you will come to see me some time, auntie?\"\"Then I will go with Dan;\" and the little girl placed her hand\nconfidingly in that of our hero.Dan thought it would be pleasant for him to have a little sister, and he\nknew that it would brighten his mother's existence.\"Shall we go now, madam?\"She drew from her pocket a wallet\ncontaining a considerable sum of money.\"I will hand you two months' payment in advance,\" she said, \"and\nafterward I will remit you monthly, or direct you where to call for\nmoney.Two months at fifty dollars will amount to one hundred, and\ntwenty more for Althea's dress will make it up to a hundred and twenty.\"Whenever I have any to be careful about,\" answered Dan.\"I hope you will be comfortably provided from this time.There is a\nlittle trunk of Althea's clothes in the trunk-room below.I will write\nyou an order for it, but you may as well wait till you have moved before\ncarrying it away.\"Then you shall go into supper with Althea and myself.\"At any rate, it's nobody's business.There was nothing to say, so Dan followed the mysterious lady into the\nsupper-room, Althea clinging to his hand.He felt awkward as he took his\nseat.Suppose some one should recognize him as the newsboy who usually\nstood in front of the Astor House!\"You see the entertainment prepared for you,\" said the officers.\"If I had no appetite for it,\" replied Morton, \"I should not have been\naccompanying you at this moment.But I shall be better pleased with a\nmore peaceful regale, for the sake of all parties.\"As they spoke thus, they approached the commander-in-chief, who,\nsurrounded by several officers, was seated upon a knoll commanding an\nextensive prospect of the distant country, and from which could be easily\ndiscovered the windings of the majestic Clyde, and the distant camp of\nthe insurgents on the opposite bank.The officers of the royal army\nappeared to be surveying the ground, with the purpose of directing an\nimmediate attack.When Captain Lumley, the officer who accompanied\nMorton, had whispered in Monmouth's ear his name and errand, the Duke\nmade a signal for all around him to retire, excepting only two general\nofficers of distinction.While they spoke together in whispers for a few\nminutes before Morton was permitted to advance, he had time to study the\nappearance of the persons with whom he was to treat.It was impossible for any one to look upon the Duke of Monmouth

and their picquets and patrols were more interested and\noccupied in disputing the true occasion and causes of wrath, and defining\nthe limits of Erastian heresy, than in looking out for and observing the\nmotions of their enemies, though within hearing of the royal drums and\ntrumpets.There was a guard, however, of the insurgent army, posted at the long and\nnarrow bridge of Bothwell, over which the enemy must necessarily advance\nto the attack; but, like the others, they were divided and disheartened;\nand, entertaining the idea that they were posted on a desperate service,\nthey even meditated withdrawing themselves to the main body.This would\nhave been utter ruin; for, on the defence or loss of this pass the\nfortune of the day was most likely to depend.All beyond the bridge was a\nplain open field, excepting a few thickets of no great depth, and,\nconsequently, was ground on which the undisciplined forces of the\ninsurgents, deficient as they were in cavalry, and totally unprovided\nwith artillery, were altogether unlikely to withstand the shock of\nregular troops.Morton, therefore, viewed the pass carefully, and formed the hope, that\nby occupying two or three houses on the left bank of the river, with the\ncopse and thickets of alders and hazels that lined its side, and by\nblockading the passage itself, and shutting the gates of a portal, which,\naccording to the old fashion, was built on the central arch of the bridge\nof Bothwell, it might be easily defended against a very superior force.He issued directions accordingly, and commanded the parapets of the\nbridge, on the farther side of the portal, to be thrown down, that they\nmight afford no protection to the enemy when they should attempt the\npassage.Morton then conjured the party at this important post to be\nwatchful and upon their guard, and promised them a speedy and strong\nreinforcement.He caused them to advance videttes beyond the river to\nwatch the progress of the enemy, which outposts he directed should be\nwithdrawn to the left bank as soon as they approached; finally, he\ncharged them to send regular information to the main body of all that\nthey should observe.Men under arms, and in a situation of danger, are\nusually sufficiently alert in appreciating the merit of their officers.Morton's intelligence and activity gained the confidence of these men,\nand with better hope and heart than before, they began to fortify their\nposition in the manner he recommended, and saw him depart with three loud\ncheers.Morton now galloped hastily towards the main body of the insurgents, but", "question": "Where is Mary?

that\nshe was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian\ngirls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to\nsuppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,\nand exaggerated her own station as Princess.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.She certainly put on no\nairs of royalty when she was \"cart-wheeling\" about the fort.Nor\ndoes this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and\nconverted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been\nnoticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept\na private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave\nher age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,\naged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was\ncaptured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's\ncaptivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion\nas to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of\naffairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the\nage of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have\nfollowed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse\nwith the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be\noffered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the \"General Historie\" are so\nevidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When\nand where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London\nportrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey\nsays she was \"at more ripe yeares.\"How she was occupied from the\ndeparture of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her\nauthentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of\nRalph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous\nin the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia\nin September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an\nexpedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture\nthat would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,\nhad become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall\nsays: \"I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great\nPowhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,\nwhither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any\nstratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as\nwere prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as\nhe and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our\nnation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief.\"By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and\nfriend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,\nPocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent\nto Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be\nreleased; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the\ntools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Powhatan, \"much grieved,\" replied that if Argall would use his daughter\nwell, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede\nto all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to\nGovernor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days\nafter the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one\nbroad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,\nwas kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek\nwe can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her\nfriendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may\nbe that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,\nand murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,\nthough Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph\nHamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in\n1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)\n\"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there\ntill the 18th of June, 1614.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in\nLondon who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:\n\n\"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas\n(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella\nof Firginia) in her princ", "question": "Where is John?

but although this savage is\nrepresented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his \"delight and darling,\" it\nwas, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from\nhim.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He\nretained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that\nPocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him\ntill the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with\nseveral vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's\nchief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance\nto fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen\ngoods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,\nreminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,\nkilled some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went\non up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's\nchief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and\narrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver\nwas held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which\nthey would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their\nsister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and\nsaw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to\npersuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The\ntwo brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master\nSparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show\nhimself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his\nbest efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to\nJamestown.\"Long before this time,\" Hamor relates, \"a gentleman of approved\nbehaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with\nPocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were\nin parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter\nfrom him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his\nlove, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and\nPocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith.\"Governor Dale\napproved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other\nconditions.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.\"The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]\ncame soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as\nappeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent\nan old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the\nchurch, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was\naccordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have\nhad friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but\nalso with his subjects round about us;

GRELIEU\n\nYes, we are very few in number.PIERRE\n\nVery, very few, father!Even if we were\ninvulnerable and deathless, even if we kept killing them off\nday and night, day and night, we would drop from fatigue and\nexhaustion before we stopped them.But we are mortal--and they\nhave terrible guns, father!You are thinking of\nour Maurice--I have caused you pain?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nThere is little of the human in their movements.Do not think\nof Maurice--he will live.Every human being has his own face, but they have no faces.When I try to picture them to myself, I see only the lights,\nprojectors, automobiles--those terrible guns--and something\nwalking, walking.And those vulgar mustaches of Wilhelm--but\nthat is a mask, an immobile mask, which has stood over Europe\nfor a quarter of a century--what is behind it?Those vulgar\nmustaches--and suddenly so much misery, so much bloodshed and\ndestruction!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.PIERRE\n\n_Almost to

garden.EMIL GRELIEU\n\nI don't know whether he hears anything or not.But there was a\ntime when he did hear.He is silent, Pierre, and he furiously\ndenies war.He denies it by work--he works alone in the garden\nas if nothing had happened.Mamma and everyone else in the house are busy, feeding them,\nwashing the children--mamma is washing them--but he does not\nseem to notice anything.Now he is bursting from\nanxiety to hear or guess what we are saying, but do you see the\nexpression of his face?If you start to talk to him he will go\naway.EMIL GRELIEU\n\nDon't bother him.You see that she is not here, and yet these are your last hours\nat home.Yes, in this house--I am speaking of the house.She\nis young and resolute as ever, she walks just as lightly and is\njust as clear-headed, but she is not here.PIERRE\n\nIs she concealing something?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nNo, she is not concealing anything, but she has gone into the\ndepths of her own self, where all is silence and mystery.She is\nliving through her motherhood again, from the very beginning--do\nyou understand?when you and Maurice were not yet born--but\nin this she is crafty, like Fran\u00e7ois.Sometimes I see clearly\nthat she is suffering unbearably, that she is terrified by the\nwar--.But she smiles in answer and then I see something else--I\nsee how there has suddenly awakened in her the prehistoric\nwoman--the woman who handed her husband the fighting club--._Military music is heard in the distance, nearing._\n\nPIERRE\n\nYes, according to the assignment, it is the Ninth Regiment.EMIL GRELIEU\n\nLet us hear it,

in vain to hear.The music begins to die out._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\n_Walking away from the window._\n\nYesterday they played the \"Marseillaise.\"During their journey they saw not the\nslightest indications of the Indians.It was quite evident that they\nwere all occupied with the _siege_ of the temple.On leaving the entrance, the boys restored the vines so far as possible\nto their original condition and filled their automatics with cartridges.\u201cNo one will ever catch me without cartridges again,\u201d Carl declared as\nhe patted his weapon.\u201cThe idea of getting into a den of lions with only\nfour shots between us and destruction!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, hurry up!\u201d cried Jimmie.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.\u201cI know from the accent the Indians\nplaced on the last syllable that there\u2019s something doing at the temple.And Sam, you know, hasn\u2019t got many cartridges.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t run very fast,\u201d declared Carl, \u201cif I knew that the Indians\nhad captured Miguel.That\u2019s the ruffian who shut us into the den of\nlions!\u201d\n\nWhen the boys came to the passage opening from the tunnel on the west of\nthe temple, they turned into it and proceeded a few yards south.Here\nthey found an opening which led undoubtedly directly to the rear of the\ncorridor in the vicinity of the fountain.The stone which had in past years concealed the mouth of this passage\nhad evidently not been used for a long time, for it lay broken into\nfragments on the stone floor.When the boys came to the end of the passage, they saw by the slices of\nlight which lay between the stones that they were facing the corridor\nfrom the rear.They knew well enough that somewhere in that vicinity was\na door opening into the temple, but for some moments they could not find\nit.At last Jimmie, prying into a crack with his knife, struck a piece\nof metal and the stone dropped backward.He was about to crawl through into the corridor when Carl caught him by\none leg and held him back.It took the lad only an instant to comprehend\nwhat was going on.A horde of savages was crowding up the steps and into\nthe temple itself, and Sam stood in the middle of the corridor with a\nsmoking weapon in his hand.As the boys looked he threw the automatic into the faces of the\nonrushing crowd as if its usefulness had departed.THE SAVAGES MAKE MORE TROUBLE.\u201cPedro said the savages wouldn\u2019t dare enter the temple!\u201d declared Jimmie\nas he drew back.Without stopping to comment on the situation, Carl called out:\n\n\u201cDrop, Sam, drop!\u201d\n\nThe young man whirled about, saw the opening in the rear wall, saw the\nbrown barrels of the automatics, and instantly dropped to the floor.The\nIndians advanced no farther, for in less time than it takes to say the\nwords a rain of bullets struck into their ranks.Half a dozen fell to\nthe floor and the others retreated, sneaking back in a minute, however,\nto remove the", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "The boys did not fire while this duty was being performed.In a minute from the time of the opening of the stone panel in the wall\nthere was not a savage in sight.Only for the smears of blood on the\nwhite marble floor, and on the steps outside, no one would have imagined\nthat so great a tragedy had been enacted there only a few moments\nbefore.Sam rose slowly to his feet and stood by the boys as they\ncrawled out of the narrow opening just above the basin of the fountain.\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you, kids,\u201d he said, in a matter-of-fact tone, although\nhis face was white to the lips.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.\u201cYou came just in time!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe usually do arrive on schedule,\u201d Jimmie grinned, trying to make as\nlittle as possible of the rescue.\u201cYou did this time at any rate!\u201d replied Sam.\u201cBut, look here,\u201d he went\non, glancing at the automatics in their hands, \u201cI thought the ammunition\nwas all used up in the den of lions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got some more!\u201d laughed Carl.\u201cMore\u2014where?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the _Ann_!\u201d\n\nSam leaned back against the wall, a picture of amazement.\u201cYou haven\u2019t been out to the _Ann_ have you?\u201d he asked.For reply Jimmie drew a great package of sandwiches and another of\ncartridges out of the opening in the wall.The boys briefly related the story of their visit to the aeroplane while\nSam busied himself with the sandwiches, and then they loaded the three\nautomatics and distributed the remaining clips about their persons.\u201cAnd now what?\u201d asked Carl, after the completion of the recital.\u201cAre we going to take the _Ann_ and slip away from these worshipers of\nthe Sun?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cWe can do it all right!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d argued Sam.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.\u201cYou drove them away from the\ntemple, and the chances are that they will return to the forest and will\nremain there until they get the courage to make another attack on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long to go and find out whether they are in the forest or\nnot!\u201d Carl declared.\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Sam suggested, \u201cwe\u2019d better wait here for the others to come\nup.They ought to be here to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a sure thing that we can let them know where we are,\u201d Carl\nagreed, \u201cthat might be all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the red and blue lights?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cBy the way,\u201d Carl inquired looking about the place, \u201cwhere is Pedro?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe took to his heels when the savages made the rush.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich way did he go?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cI think he went in the direction of that little menagerie you boys\nfound last night!\u201d replied Sam.\u201cThen I\u2019ll bet he knows where the tunnel is!\u201d Carl shouted, dashing\naway.\u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s lit out for the purpose of bringing a lot of his\nconspirators in here to do us up!\u201d\n\nJimmie followed his chum, and the two searched the entire system of\ntunnels known to them without discovering any trace of the missing man.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.\u201cThat\u2019s a nice thing!\u201d Jimmie declared.\u201cWe probably passed him\nsomewhere on our way back to the temple.By this time he\u2019s off over the\nhills, making signals for some one to come and help put us to the bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re right!\u201d replied Sam.The boys ate their sandwiches and discussed plans and prospects,\nlistening in the meantime for indications of the two missing men.Several times they thought they heard soft footsteps in the apartments\nopening from the corridor, but in each case investigation revealed\nnothing.It was a long afternoon, but finally the sun disappeared over the ridge\nto the west of the little lake and the boys began considering the\nadvisability of making ready to signal to the _Louise_ and _Bertha_.\u201cThey will surely be here?\u201d said Carl hopefully.\u201cThen we\u2019d better be getting something on top of the temple to make a\nlight,\u201d advised Jimmie.\u201cIf I had Miguel by the neck, he\u2019d bring out his\nred and blue lights before he took another breath!\u201d he added.\u201cPerhaps we can find the lights,\u201d suggested Sam.This idea being very much to the point, the boys scattered themselves\nover the three apartments and searched diligently for the lamps or\ncandles which had been used by Miguel on the previous night.\u201cNothing doing!\u201d Jimmie declared, returning to the corridor.\u201cNothing doing!\u201d echoed Carl, coming in from the other way.Sam joined the group in a moment looking very much discouraged.\u201cBoys,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been broke in nearly all the large cities on both\nWestern continents.I\u2019ve been kicked out of lodging houses, and I\u2019ve\nwalked hundreds of miles with broken shoes and little to eat, but of all\nthe everlasting, consarned, ridiculous, propositions I ever butted up\nagainst, this is the worst!\u201d\n\nThe boys chuckled softly but made no reply.\u201cWe know well enough,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat there are rockets, or lamps, or\ntorches, or candles, enough hidden about this place to signal all the\ntranscontinental trains in the world but we can\u2019t find enough of them to\nflag a hand-car on an uphill grade!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the searchlights?\u201d asked Jimmie.\u201cNot sufficiently strong!\u201d\n\nWithout any explanation, Jimmie darted away from the group and began a\ntour of the temple.First he walked along the walls of the corridor then\ndarted to the other room, then out on the steps in front.\u201cHis trouble has turned his head!\u201d jeered Carl.\u201cLook here, you fellows!\u201d Jimmie answered darting back into the temple.\u201cThere\u2019s a great white rock on the cliff back of the temple.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.It looks\nlike one of these memorial stones aldermen put their names on when they\nbuild a city hall.All we have to do to signal the aeroplanes is to put\nred caps over our searchlights and turn them on that cliff.They will\nmake a circle of fire there that will look like the round, red face of a\nharvest moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d agreed Carl.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find a way to get up on the roof,\u201d Jimmie\ncontinued, \u201cbut can\u2019t find one.You see,\u201d he went on, \u201cwe can operate\nour searchlights better from the top of the temple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find a way to get up there!\u201d Sam insisted.\u201cUnless we can make the illumination on the cliff through the hole in\nthe roof,\u201d Jimmie proposed.\u201cAnd that\u2019s another good proposition!\u201d Sam agreed.\u201cAnd so,\u201d laughed Carl, \u201cthe stage is set and the actors are in the\nwings, and I\u2019m going to crawl into one of the bunks in the west room and\ngo to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go, too, Jimmie,\u201d Sam advised.\u201cI\u2019ll wake you up if anything\nhappens.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.I can get my rest later on.\u201d\n\nThe boys were not slow in accepting the invitation, and in a very short\ntime were sound asleep.It would be time for the _Bertha_ and _Louise_\nto show directly, and so Sam placed the red caps over the lamps of two\nof the electrics and sat where he could throw the rays through the break\nin the roof.Curious to know if the result was exactly as he\nanticipated, he finally propped one of the lights in position on the\nfloor and went out to the entrance to look up at the rock.As he stepped out on the smooth slab of marble in front of the entrance\nsomething whizzed within an inch of his head and dropped with a crash on\nthe stones below.Without stopping to investigate the young man dodged\ninto the temple again and looked out.\u201cNow,", "question": "Where is Sandra? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.It was apparent that the remainder of the\nevening was not to be as peaceful and quiet as he had anticipated.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.Realizing that the hostile person or persons on the roof might in a\nmoment begin dropping their rocks down to the floor of the corridor, he\npassed hastily into the west chamber and stood by the doorway looking\nout.This interference, he understood, would effectually prevent any\nillumination of the white rock calculated to serve as a signal to Mr.Some other means of attracting their attention must\nbe devised.The corridor lay dim in the faint light of the stars which\ncame through the break in the roof, and he threw the light of his\nelectric up and down the stone floor in order to make sure that the\nenemy was not actually creeping into the temple from the entrance.While he stood flashing the light about he almost uttered an exclamation\nof fright as a grating sound in the vicinity of the fountain came to his\nears.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.He cast his light in that direction and saw the stone which had\nbeen replaced by the boys retreating slowly into the wall.Then a dusky face looked out of the opening, and, without considering\nthe ultimate consequences of his act, he fired full at the threatening\neyes which were searching the interior.There was a groan, a fall, and\nthe stone moved back to its former position.He turned to awaken Jimmie and Carl but the sound of the shot had\nalready accomplished that, and the boys were standing in the middle of\nthe floor with automatics in their hands.\u201cThunder don\u2019t smell like that,\u201d suggested Jimmie, sniffing at the\npowder smoke.\u201cI guess Sam has been having company.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight you are,\u201d said Sam, doing his best to keep the note of\napprehension out of his voice.\u201cOur friends are now occupying the tunnel\nyou told me about.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.At least one of them was, not long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, see here,\u201d Jimmie broke in, \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this\nhide-and-seek business around this blooming old ruin.We came out to\nsail in the air, and not crawl like snakes through underground\npassages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d asked Carl.\u201cAccording to Sam\u2019s story,\u201d Jimmie went on, \u201cwe won\u2019t be able to signal\nour friends with our red lights to-night.In that case, they\u2019re likely\nto fly by, on their way south, without discovering our whereabouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you want to go back to the machine, eh?\u201d Sam questioned.\u201cI want to get up into God\u2019s free\nair again, where I can see the stars, and the snow caps on the\nmountains!I want to build a roaring old fire on some shelf of rock and\nbuild up a stew big enough for a regiment of state troops!Then I want\nto roll up in a blanket and sleep for about a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me, too!\u201d declared Carl.\u201cIt may not be possible to get to the machine,\u201d suggested Sam.\u201cI\u2019ll let you know in about five minutes!\u201d exclaimed Jimmie darting\nrecklessly across the corridor and into the chamber which had by mutual\nconsent been named the den of lions.Sam called to him to return but the boy paid no heed to the warning.\u201cCome on!\u201d Carl urged the next moment.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go with him.\u201d\n\nSam seized a package of sandwiches which lay on the roughly constructed\ntable and darted with the boy across the corridor, through the east\nchamber, into the subterranean one, and passed into the tunnel, the\nentrance to which, it will be remembered, had been left open.Some distance down in the darkness, probably where the passage swung\naway to the north, they saw a glimmer of light.Directly they heard\nJimmie\u2019s voice calling softly through the odorous darkness.\u201cWe may as well get out to the woods and see\nwhat\u2019s doing there.\u201d\n\nThe two half-walked, half-stumbled, down the slippery incline and joined\nJimmie at the bottom.\u201cNow we want to look out,\u201d the boy said as they came to the angle which\nfaced the west.\u201cThere may be some of those rude persons in the tunnel\nahead of us.\u201d\n\nNot caring to proceed in the darkness, they kept their lights burning as\nthey advanced.When they came to the cross passage which led to the rear\nof the corridor they listened for an instant and thought they detected a\nlow murmur of voices in the distance.\u201cLet\u2019s move for the machine and\nthe level of the stars.If the savages are there, we\u2019ll chase \u2019em out.\u201d\n\nBut the savages were not there.When the three came to the curtain of\nvines which concealed the entrance to the passage, the forest seemed as\nstill as it had been on the day of creation.They moved out of the tangle and crept forward to the aeroplane, their\nlights now out entirely, and their automatics ready for use.They were\nsoon at the side of the machine.After as good an examination as could possibly be made in the\nsemi-darkness, Sam declared that nothing had been molested, and that the\n_Ann_ was, apparently, in as good condition for flight as it had been at\nthe moment of landing.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do this in the afternoon, while the <DW65>s were out of\nsight?\u201d asked Carl in disgust.\u201cSam said we couldn\u2019t!\u201d grinned Jimmie.\u201cAnyhow,\u201d Sam declared, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see right now whether we can or\nnot.We\u2019ll have to push the old bird out into a clear place first,\nthough!\u201d\n\nHere the talk was interrupted by a chorus of savage shouts.The _Louise_ and the _Bertha_ left the field near Quito amid the shouts\nof a vast crowd which gathered in the early part of the day.As the\naeroplanes sailed majestically into the air, Mr.Havens saw Mellen\nsitting in a motor-car waving a white handkerchief in farewell.The millionaire and Ben rode in the _Louise_, while Glenn followed in\nthe _Bertha_.For a few moments the clatter of the motors precluded\nconversation, then the aviator slowed down a trifle and asked his\ncompanion:\n\n\u201cWas anything seen of Doran to-day?\u201d\n\nBen shook his head.Memories have I none in keeping\n          Of times I held you near my heart,\n   Of dreams when we were near to weeping\n          That dawn should bid us rise and

A. S. upon his shirt.\"The S, Padre, is the initial of my mother's family name.I am Rosendo\nAriza, son of the daughter of Saurez.My parents were married by a\npriest.But half the people of Simiti have never been really\nmarried.\"Jose sought the cause of this dereliction.Fidel Avila was living with\na woman, by whom he had three children.The priest summoned him to the\nparish house.\"Fidel,\" he questioned sternly, \"Jacinta, the woman you live with, is\nyour wife?\"\"But was there a priest here when you began to live with Jacinta?\"The _Cura_, Don Diego Polo, was here.\"\"Then why were you not married by him?Do you not know how wicked it\nis to live as you are doing?\"Yes, Padre, and I asked the _Cura_, Don Diego, to marry us.But he\ncharged twenty _pesos oro_ for doing it; and I could not afford it.And so we decided to live together without the\nmarriage.\"He knew that the Church recognized no marriage\nunless it were performed by a priest.The civil magistrate had no\njurisdiction in such a case.And a former priest's rapacity had\nresulted in forcing illegitimacy upon half the children of this\nbenighted hamlet, because of their parents' inability to afford the\nluxury of a canonical marriage.\"Fidel, were your father and mother married?\"Only a few people in Guamoco can afford to pay\nto be married.The men and women live together, perhaps for all time,\nperhaps for only a few months.If a man wishes to leave his woman and\nlive with another, he does so.If there are children, the woman always\nhas to keep and care for them.\"\"And could you leave Jacinta if you wished, and live with another\nwoman?\"\"And she would have to lake care of your children?\"\"_Hombre!_ But that will do, Fidel.\"Oh, the sordid greed of those who abuse their sacred commission!What\npunishment is mete for such as exploit these lowly folk in the name of\nreligion!Jose strode off to consult the Alcalde.\"Don Mario, the men in Simiti who are living with women have _got_ to\nbe married to them!I shall make a canvass of the town\nat once!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway._Costumbre del pais!_ It is a final answer all through South America.No matter how unreasonable a thing may be, if it is the custom of the\ncountry it is a Medean law.\"But you know this is subversive of Church discipline!\"\"Look you, Don Mario,\" he added suggestively, \"you and I are\nto work together, are we not?\"The Alcalde blinked his pig eyes, but thought hard about La Libertad.\"Then I demand that you summon before me every man and woman who are\nliving together unmarried.\"With a thought single to his own future advantage, the wary Alcalde\ncomplied.Within the week following this interview Jose married twenty\ncouples, and without charge.These he\ntook and immediately turned over to Don Mario as treasurer of the\nparish.Those couples who refused to be married were forced by the\nAlcalde to separate.Packing his few household effects upon his back, and\nmuttering imprecations against the priest, Gomez set out for the\nhills, still followed by his woman, with a babe slung over her\nshoulders and two naked children toddling at her bare heels.Verily, the ancient town was being profoundly stirred by the man who\nhad sought to find his tomb there.Gradually the people lost their\nsuspicions and distrust, bred of former bitter experience with\npriests, and joined heartily with Jose to ameliorate the social status\nof the place.His sincere love for them, and his utter selflessness,\nsecured their confidence, and ere his first month among them closed,\nhe had won them, almost to a man.Meantime, six weeks had passed since Rosendo had departed to take up\nhis lonely task of self-renouncing love.Then one day he returned,\nworn and emaciated, his great frame shaking like a withered leaf in a\nchill blast.\"It is the _terciana_, Padre,\" he said, as he sank", "question": "Where is John?

but\nshe returned in time to assist Dona Maria with the evening meal,\nafter which she went at once to her bed.Late at night, when the sympathizing townsmen had sorrowfully departed\nand Jose had induced Dona Maria to seek a few moments rest on her\n_petate_ in the living room, Carmen climbed quietly out of her bed and\ncame to where the priest sat alone with the unconscious Rosendo.Jose was bending over the delirious man.\"Oh, if Jesus were only here\nnow!\"Jose looked down into the little face beside him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.The little head\nshook as if to emphasize the words.But he put his arm about the child and drew her to\nhim.\"_Chiquita_, why do you say that?\"\"Because God doesn't die, you know,\" she quickly replied.\"And we are\nlike Him, Padre, aren't we?\"\"But He calls us to Him, _chiquita_.And--I guess--He is--is calling\nyour padre Rosendo now.\"Does God kill mankind in order to give them life?And--\n\n\"Why, no, Padre,\" returned the innocent child.\"He is always here;

at the farther,\nchalking their cues, stood two players, one a sturdy Englishman with a\ngray moustache, the other a lithe, graceful person, whose blue coat,\nsmart as an officer's, and swarthy but handsome face made him at a\nglance the most striking figure in the room.A little Chinese imp in\nwhite, who acted as marker, turned on the new-comers a face of\npreternatural cunning.The weazened reader rose in a nervous\nflutter, underwent his introduction to Rudolph with as much bashful\nagony as a school-girl, mumbled a few words in German, and instantly\ntook refuge in his tattered _Graphic_.The players, however, advanced in\na more friendly fashion.The Englishman, whose name Rudolph did not\ncatch, shook his hand heartily.Something in his voice, the tired look in his frank blue eyes and\nserious face, at once engaged respect.\"For our sakes,\" he continued,\n\"we're glad to see you here.I am sure Doctor Chantel will agree\nwith me.\"\"Ah, indeed,\" said the man in military blue, with a courtier's bow.\"Let's all have a drink,\" cried Heywood.Despite his many glasses at\ndinner, he spoke with the alacrity of a new idea.\"O Boy, whiskey\n_Ho-lan suey, fai di_!\"Away bounded the boy marker like a tennis-ball.\"Hello, Wutzler's off already!\"--The little old reader had quietly\ndisappeared, leaving them a vacant table.--\"Isn't he weird?\"laughed\nHeywood, as they sat down.\"It is his Chinese wife,\" declared Chantel, preening his moustache.\"He\nis always ashame to meet the new persons.\"\"I know--feels himself an outcast and all\nthat.--The Chinese page, quick,\nsolemn, and noiseless, glided round the table with his tray.--\"Ah, you\nyoung devil!See those bead eyes\nwatching us, eh?A Gilpin Homer, you are, and some fine day we'll see\nyou go off in a flash of fire.If you don't poison us all first.--Well,\nhere's fortune!\"As they set down their glasses, a strange cry sounded from below,--a\nstifled call, inarticulate, but in such a key of distress that all four\nfaced about, and listened intently.\"Kom down,\" called a hesitating voice, \"kom down and look-see.\"They sprang to the stairs, and clattered downward.Dim radiance flooded\nthe landing, from the street door.Outside, a smoky lantern on the\nground revealed the lower levels.In the wide sector of light stood Wutzler, shrinking and apologetic,\nlike a man caught in a fault, his wrinkled face eloquent of fear, his\ngesture eloquent of excuse.Round him, as round a conjurer, scores of\nlittle shadowy things moved in a huddling dance, fitfully hopping like\nsparrows over spilt grain.Where the light fell brightest these became\nplainer, their eyes shone in jeweled points of color.\"By Jove, Gilly, they are rats!\"said Heywood, in a voice curiously\nforced and matter-of-fact.\"Flounce killed several this afternoon,\nso my--\"\n\nNo one heeded him;

for the most part,\nhe swayed along indoors, beneath a dingy lattice roof.All points of the\ncompass vanished; all streets remained alike,--the same endless vista of\nmystic characters, red, black, and gold, on narrow suspended tablets,\nunder which flowed the same current of pig-tailed men in blue and dirty\nwhite.From every shop, the same yellow faces stared at him, the same\nelfin children caught his eye for a half-second to grin or grimace, the\nsame shaven foreheads bent over microscopical tasks in the dark.At\nfirst, Rudolph thought the city loud and brawling; but resolving this\nimpression to the hideous shouts of his coolies parting the crowd, he\ndetected, below or through their noise, from all the long\ncross-corridors a wide and appalling silence.Gradually, too, small\nsounds relieved this: the hammering of brass-work, the steady rattle of\na loom, or the sing-song call and mellow bell of some burdened hawker,\nbumping past, his swinging baskets filled with a pennyworth of trifles.But still the silence daunted Rudolph in this astounding vision, this\nmasque of unreal life, of lost daylight, of annihilated direction, of\nplacid turmoil and multifarious identity, made credible only by the\npermanence of nauseous smells.Somewhere in the dark maze, the chairs halted, under a portal black and\nheavy as a Gate of Dreams.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.And as by the anachronism of dreams\nthere hung, among its tortuous symbols, the small, familiar\nplacard--\"Fliegelman and Sons, Office.\"Heywood led the way, past two\nducking Chinese clerks, into a sombre room, stone-floored, furnished\nstiffly with a row of carved chairs against the wall, lighted coldly by\nroof-windows of placuna, and a lamp smoking before some commercial god\nin his ebony and tinsel shrine.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.\"There,\" he said, bringing Rudolph to an inner chamber, or dark little\npent-house, where another draughty<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.", "question": "Where is Mary?

and little\nby little, as the sorted piles grew and his pen traveled faster, the old\nabsorbing love of method and dispatch--the stay, the cordial flagon of\ntroubled man--gave him strength to forget.At times, felt shoes scuffed the stone floor without, and high, scolding\nvoices rose, exchanging unfathomable courtesy with his clerks.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.One after\nanother, strange figures, plump and portly in their  robes,\ncrossed his threshold, nodding their buttoned caps, clasping their hands\nhidden in voluminous sleeves.\"My 'long speakee my goo' flien',\" chanted each of these apparitions;\nand each, after a long, slow discourse that ended more darkly than it\nbegan, retired with fatuous nods and smirks of satisfaction, leaving\nRudolph dismayed by a sense of cryptic negotiation in which he had been\nfound wanting.Noon brought the only other interval, when two solemn \"boys\" stole in\nwith curry and beer.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.Eat he could not in this lazaret, but sipped a\nlittle of the dark Kirin brew, and plunged again into his researches.Alone with his lamp and rustling papers, he fought through perplexities,\nnow whispering, now silent, like a student rapt in some midnight fervor.Heywood's voice woke him, sudden\nas a gust of sharp air.The summons was both welcome and unwelcome;

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Above the side aisles was a gallery, the roof of which was\nsupported by an upper row of columns.From the same columns also sprang\nthe arches of the great central aisle.The total internal height was\nthus probably about 120 ft., or higher than any English cathedral,\nthough not so high as some German and French churches.At one end was a great semicircular apse, the back part of which was\nraised, being approached by a semicircular range of steps.In the centre\nof this platform was the raised seat of the qu\u00e6stor or other magistrate\nwho presided.On each side, upon the steps, were places for the\nassessors or others engaged in the business being transacted.In front\nof the apse was placed an altar, where sacrifice was performed before\ncommencing any important public business.[175]\n\nExternally this basilica could not have been of much magnificence.It\nwas entered on the side of the Forum (on the left hand of the plan and\nsection) by one triple doorway in the centre and two single ones on\neither side, flanked by shallow porticoes of columns of the same height\nas those used internally.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.These supported statues, or rather, to judge\nfrom the coins representing the building, rilievos, which may have set\noff, but could hardly have given much dignity to, a building designed as\nthis was.At the end opposite the apse a similar arrangement seems to\nhave prevailed.This mode of using columns only half the height of the edifice must have\nbeen very destructive of their effect and of the general grandeur of the\nstructure, but it became about this time rather the rule than the\nexception, and was afterwards adopted for temples and every other class\nof buildings, so that it was decidedly an improvement when the arch took\nthe place of the horizontal architrave and cornice; the latter always\nsuggested a roof, and became singularly incongruous when applied as a\nmere ornamental adjunct at half the height of the fa\u00e7ade.The interior\nof the basilica was, however, the important element to which the\nexterior was entirely sacrificed, a transition in architectural design\nwhich we have before alluded to, taking place much faster in basilicas,\nwhich were an entirely new form of building, than in temples, whose\nconformation had become sacred from the traditions of past ages.Longitudinal Section of Basilica of Maxentius.Transverse Section of Basilica of Maxentius.The basilica of Maxentius, which was probably not entirely finished till\nthe reign of Constantine, was rather broader than that of Trajan, being\n195 ft.between the walls, but it was 100 ft.The\ncentral aisle was very nearly of the same width, being 83 ft.between\nthe walls, and 120 ft.There was, however, a vast difference\nin the construction of the two; so much so, that we are startled to see\nhow rapid the progress had been during the interval, of less than two\ncenturies, that had elapsed between the construction of the two\nbasilicas.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.Pillar of Maxentian Basilica.(From an old print\nquoted by Letarouilly.)]In this building no pillars were used with the exception of eight great\ncolumns in front of the piers, employed merely as ornaments, or as\nvaulting shafts were in Gothic cathedrals, to support in appearance,\nthough not in construction, the springing of the vaults.[176] The\nside-aisles were roofed by three great arches, each 74 ft.in span, and\nthe centre by an immense intersecting vault in three compartments.The\nform of these will be understood from the annexed sections (Woodcuts\nNos.202 and 203), one taken longitudinally, the other across the\nbuilding.As will be seen from them, all the thrusts are collected to a\npoint and a buttress placed there to receive them: indeed almost all the\npeculiarities afterwards found in Gothic vaults are here employed on a\nfar grander and more gigantic scale than the Gothic architects ever\nattempted; but at the same time it must be allowed that the latter, with\nsmaller dimensions, often contrived by a more artistic treatment of\ntheir materials to obtain as grand an effect and far more actual beauty\nthan ever were attained in the great transitional halls of the Romans.The largeness of the parts of the Roman buildings was indeed their\nprincipal defect, as in consequence of this they must all have appeared\nsmaller than they really were, whereas in all Gothic cathedrals the\nrepetition and smallness of the component parts has the effect of\nmagnifying their real dimensions.The roofs of these halls had one peculiarity which it would have been\nwell if the medi\u00e6val architects had copied, inasmuch as they were all,\nor at least might have been, honestly used as roofs without any\nnecessity for their being covered with others of wood, as all Gothic\nvaults unfortunately were.It is true this is perhaps one of the causes\nof their destruction, for, being only overlaid with cement, the rain\nwore away the surface, as must inevitably be the case with any\ncomposition of the sort exposed horizontally to the weather, and that\nbeing gone, the moisture soon penetrated through the crevices of the\nmasonry, destroying the stability of the vault.Still, some of these in\nRome have resisted for fifteen centuries, after the removal of any\ncovering they ever might have had, all the accidents of climate and\ndecay, while there is not a Gothic vault of half their dimensions that\nwould stand for a century after the removal of its wooden protection.The construction of a vault capable of resisting the destructive effects\nof exposure to the atmosphere still remains a problem for modern\narchitects to solve.Until this is accomplished we must regard roofs\nentirely of honest wood as preferable to the deceptive stone ceilings\nwhich were such favourites in the Middle Ages.Plan of the Basilica at Tr\u00e8ves.Internal View of the Basilica at Tr\u00e8ves.]The provincial basilicas of the Roman Empire have nearly all perished,\nprobably from their having been converted, first into churches, for\nwhich they were so admirably adapted, and then rebuilt to suit the\nexigencies and taste of subsequent ages.One example, however, still\nexists in Tr\u00e8ves of sufficient completeness to give a good idea of what\nsuch structures were.As will be seen by the annexed plan, it consists\nof a great hall, 85 ft.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.in width internally, and rather more than twice\nthat dimension in length.in height and\npierced with two rows of windows; but whether they were originally\nseparated by a gallery or not is now by no means clear.At one end was\nthe apse, rather more than a semicircle of 60 ft.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.The floor\nof the apse was raised considerably above that of the body of the\nbuilding, and was no doubt adorned by a hemicycle of seats raised on\nsteps, with a throne in the centre for the judge.The building has been\nused for so many purposes since the time of the Romans, and has been so\nmuch altered, that it is not easy now to speak with certainty of any of\nits minor arrangements.Its internal and external appearance, as it\nstood before the recent restoration, are well expressed in the annexed\nwoodcuts; and though ruined, it was the most complete example of a Roman\nbasilica to be found anywhere out of the capital.A building of this\ndescription has been found at Pompeii, which may be considered a fair\nexample of a provincial basilica of the second class.Its plan is\nperfectly preserved, as shown in Woodcut No.The most striking\ndifference existing between it and", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.It must, however, be\nobserved that Pompeii was situated nearer to Magna Gr\u00e6cia than to Rome,\nand was indeed far more a Greek than a Roman city.Very slight traces of\nany Etruscan designs have been discovered there, and scarcely any\nbuildings of the circular form so much in vogue in the capital.Though\nthe ground-plan of this basilica remains perfect, the upper parts are\nentirely destroyed, and we do not even know for certain whether the\ncentral portion was roofed or not.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.[177]\n\n[Illustration: 207.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.External View of the Basilica at Tr\u00e8ves.]There is a small square building at Otricoli, which is generally\nsupposed to be a basilica, but its object as well as its age is so\nuncertain that nothing need be said of it here.In the works of\nVitruvius, too, there is a description of one built by him at Fano, the\nrestoration of which has afforded employment for the ingenuity of the\nadmirers of that worst of architects.Even taking it as restored by\nthose most desirous of making the best of it, it is difficult to\nunderstand how anything so bad could have been erected in such an age.It is extremely difficult to trace the origin of these basilicas, owing\nprincipally to the loss of all the earlier examples.Their name is\nGreek, and they may probably be considered as derived from the Grecian\nLesche, or perhaps as amplifications of the cell\u00e6 of Greek temples,\nappropriated to the purposes of justice rather than of religion; but\ntill we know more of their earlier form and origin, it is useless\nspeculating on this point.The greatest interest to us, arises rather\nfrom the use to which their plan was afterwards applied, than from the\nsource from which they themselves sprang.All the larger Christian\nchurches in the early times were copies, more or less exact, of the\nbasilicas of which that of Trajan is an example.The abundance of\npillars, suitable to such an erection, that were found everywhere in\nRome, rendered their construction easy and cheap; and the wooden roof\nwith which they were covered was also as simple and as inexpensive a\ncovering as could well be designed.The very uses of the Christian\nbasilicas at first were by no means dissimilar to those of their heathen\noriginals, as they were in reality the assembly halls of the early\nChristian republic, before they became liturgical churches of the\nCatholic hierarchy.The more expensive construction of the bold vaults of the Maxentian\nbasilica went far beyond the means of the early Church, established in a\ndeclining and abandoned capital, and this form therefore remained\ndormant for seven or eight centuries before it was revived by the\nmedi\u00e6val architects on an infinitely smaller scale, but adorned with a\ndegree of appropriateness and taste to which the Romans were strangers.It was then used with a completeness and unity which entitle it to be\nconsidered as an entirely new style of architecture.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.The theatre was by no means so essential a part of the economy of a\nRoman city as it was of a Grecian one.With the latter it was quite as\nindispensable as the temple; and in the semi-Greek city of Herculaneum\nthere was one, and in Pompeii two, on a scale quite equal to those of\nGreece when compared with the importance of the town itself.In the\ncapital there appears only to have been one, that of Marcellus,[178]\nbuilt during the reign of Augustus.It it is very questionable whether\nwhat we now see\u2014especially the outer arcades\u2014belong to that age, or\nwhether the theatre may not have been rebuilt and these arcades added at\nsome later period.It is so completely built over by modern houses, and\nso ruined, that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any satisfactory\nopinion regarding it.Its dimensions were worthy of the capital, the\naudience part being a semicircle of 410 ft.in diameter, and the scena\nbeing of great extent in proportion to the other part, which is a\ncharacteristic of all Roman theatres, as compared with Grecian edifices\nof this class.One of the most striking Roman provincial theatres is that of Orange, in\nthe south of France.Perhaps it owes its existence, or at all events its\nsplendour, to the substratum of Grecian colonists that preceded the\nRomans in that country.in diameter, but much\nruined, in consequence of the Princes of Orange having used this part as\na bastion in some fortification they were constructing.It shows well the increased\nextent and complication of arrangements required for the theatrical\nrepresentations of the age in which it was constructed, being a\nconsiderable advance towards the more modern idea of a play, as\ndistinguished from the stately semi-religious spectacle in which the\nGreeks delighted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.The noblest part of the building is the great wall at\nthe back, an immense mass of masonry 340 ft.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.in\nheight, without a single opening above the basement, and no ornament\nexcept a range of blank arches, about midway between the basement and\nthe top, and a few projecting corbels to receive the footings of the\nmasts that supported the velarium.Nowhere does the architecture of the\nRomans shine so much as when their gigantic buildings are left to tell\ntheir own tale by the imposing grandeur of their masses.Whenever\nornament is attempted, their bad taste comes out.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.The size of their\nedifices, and the solidity of their construction, were only surpassed by\nthe Egyptians, and not always by them; and when, as here, the mass of\nmaterial heaped up stands unadorned in all its native grandeur,\ncriticism is disarmed, and the spectator stands awe-struck at its\nmajesty, and turns away convinced that truly \u201cthere were giants in those\ndays.\u201d This is not, it is true, the most intellectual way of obtaining\narchitectural effect, but it has the advantage of being the easiest, the\nmost certain to secure the desired result, and at the same time the most\npermanent.The deficiency of theatres erected by the Romans is far more than\ncompensated by the number and splendour of their amphitheatres, which,\nwith their baths, may be considered as the true types of Roman art,\nalthough it is possible that they derived this class of public buildings\nfrom the Etruscans.At Sutrium there is a very noble one cut out of the\ntufa rock,[179] which was no doubt used by that people for festal\nrepresentations long before Rome attempted anything of the kind.It is\nuncertain whether gladiatorial fights or combats of wild beasts formed\nany part of the amusements of the arena in those days, though boxing,\nwrestling, and contests of that description certainly did; but whether\nthe Etruscans actually proceeded to the shedding of blood and to\nslaughter is more than doubtful.In all contests of this kind there is the greatest and\nmost obvious advantage in being able to see your enemy full against the\nlight.Thirdly, in one or two respects, the Catholic reactionaries at\nthe beginning of the century insisted very strongly on principles of\nsociety which the general thought of the century before had almost\nentirely dropped out of sight, and which we who, in spite of many\ndifferences, still sail down the same great current, and are propelled\nby the same great", "question": "Where is Sandra?

possible.This,\nhowever, need not detract from the worth for our purpose of their\nexposition of the principles themselves.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Again, the visible traces of\nthe impression made by the writings of this school on the influential\nfounder of the earliest Positivist system, are sufficiently deep and\nimportant to make some knowledge of them of the highest historical\ninterest, both to those who accept and those who detest that system.At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were three chief\nschools of thought, the Sensational, the Catholic, and the Eclectic; or\nas it may be put in other terms, the Materialist, the Theological, and\nthe Spiritualist.The first looked for the sources of knowledge, the\nsanction of morals, the inspiring fountain and standard of aesthetics, to\nthe outside of men, to matter, and the impressions made by matter on the\ncorporeal senses.The second looked to divine revelation, authority and\nthe traditions of the Church.The third, steering a middle course,\nlooked partly within and partly without, relied partly on the senses,\npartly on revelation and history, but still more on a certain internal\nconsciousness of a direct and immediate kind, which is the supreme and\nreconciling judge of the reports alike of the senses, of history, of\ndivine revelation.[1] Each of these schools had many exponents.The\nthree most conspicuous champions of revived Catholicism were De Maistre,\nDe Bonald, and Chateaubriand.The last of them, the author of the _Genie\ndu Christianisme_, was effective in France because he is so deeply\nsentimental, but he was too little trained in speculation, and too\nlittle equipped with knowledge, to be fairly taken as the best\nintellectual representative of their way of thinking.De Bonald was of\nmuch heavier calibre.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.He really thought, while Chateaubriand only felt,\nand the _Legislation Primitive_ and the _Pensees sur Divers Sujets_\ncontain much that an enemy of the school will find it worth while to\nread, in spite of an artificial, and, if a foreigner may judge, a\ndetestable style.De Maistre was the greatest of the three, and deserves better than\neither of the others to stand as the type of the school for many\nreasons.His style is so marvellously lucid, that, notwithstanding the\nmystical, or, as he said, the illuminist side of his mind, we can never\nbe in much doubt about his meaning, which is not by any means the case\nwith Bonald.To say nothing of his immensely superior natural capacity,\nDe Maistre's extensive reading in the literature of his foes was a\nsource of strength, which might indeed have been thought indispensable,\nif only other persons had not attacked the same people as he did,\nwithout knowing much or anything at all at first-hand about them.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Then\nhe goes over the whole field of allied subjects, which we have a right\nto expect to have handled by anybody with a systematic view of the\norigin of knowledge, the meaning of ethics, the elements of social order\nand progressiveness, the government and scheme of the universe.And\nabove all, his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life,\nwhich comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with\nwhich social philosophers have to deal.Lamennais had in many respects a\nfiner mind than De Maistre, but the conclusions in which he was finally\nlanded, no less than his liberal aims, prevent him from being an example\nof the truly Catholic reaction.He obviously represented the Revolution,\nor the critical spirit, within the Catholic limits, while De Maistre's\nruling idea was, in his own trenchant phrase, '_absolument tuer\nl'esprit du dix-huitieme siecle_.'On all these accounts he appears to\nbe the fittest expositor of those conceptions which the anarchy that\nclosed the eighteenth century provoked into systematic existence.FOOTNOTE:\n\n[1] See Damiron's _La Philosophie en France au XIXieme Siecle_.I.\n\n\nJoseph de Maistre was born at Chambery in the year 1754.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.[2] His family\nwas the younger branch of a stock in Languedoc, which about the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century divided itself into two, one\nremaining in France, the other establishing itself in Piedmont.It is\nnot wonderful that the descendants of the latter, settled in a country\nof small extent and little political importance, placed a high value on\ntheir kinship with an ancient line in the powerful kingdom of France.Joseph de Maistre himself was always particularly anxious to cultivate\nclose relations with his French kinsfolk, partly from the old\naristocratic feeling of blood, and partly from his intellectual\nappreciation of the gifts of the French mind, and its vast influence as\nan universal propagating power.His father held a high office in the\ngovernment of Savoy, and enjoyed so eminent a reputation that on his\ndeath both the Senate and the King of Sardinia deliberately recorded\ntheir appreciation of his loss as a public calamity.His mother is said\nto have been a woman of lofty and devout character, and her influence\nover her eldest son was exceptionally strong and tender.He used to\ndeclare in after life that he was as docile in her hands as the youngest\nof his sisters.Among other marks of his affectionate submission to\nparental authority, we are told that during the whole time of his\nresidence at Turin, where he followed a course of law, he never read a\nsingle book without previously writing to Chambery to one or other of\nhis parents for their sanction.Such traditions linger in families, and\nwhen he came to have children of his own, they too read nothing of which\ntheir father had not been asked to express his approbation.De Maistre's\nearly education was directed by the Jesuits; and as might have been\nexpected from the generous susceptibility of his temper, he never ceased\nto think of them with warm esteem.To the end of his life he remembered\nthe gloom which fell upon the household, though he was not nine years\nold at the time, when the news arrived of the edict of 1764, abolishing\nthe Society in the kingdom of France.One element of his education he\ncommemorates in a letter to his favourite daughter.'Let your brother,'\nhe says, 'work hard at the French poets.Let him learn them by heart,\nespecially the incomparable Racine; never mind whether he understands\nhim yet or not.I didn't understand him when my mother used to come\nrepeating his verses by my bedside, and lulled me to sleep with her\nfine voice to the sound of that inimitable music.I knew hundreds of\nlines long before I knew how to read; and it is thus that my ears,\naccustomed betimes to this ambrosia, have never since been able to\nendure any sourer draught.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.After his law studies at the University of Turin, then highly renowned\nfor its jurisconsults, the young De Maistre went through the successive\nstages of an official career, performing various duties in

for it was\na Saturday evening in August, and many persons had, through the\nconfusion of the trains, been long delayed in their return from\nthe city to their homes at the sea-side.The first intimation the\npassengers had of the danger impending over them was from the\nsudden and lurid illumination of the car by the glare from the\nhead-light of the approaching locomotive.One of them who survived\nthe disaster, though grievously injured, described how he was\ncarelessly watching a young man standing in the aisle, laughing\nand gayly chatting with four young girls, who were seated, when he\nsaw him turn and instantly his face, in the sudden blaze of the\nhead-light, assumed a look of frozen horror which was the single\nthing in the accident indelibly impressed on the survivor's memory;\nthat look haunted him.The car was crowded to its full capacity, and\nthe colliding locomotive struck it with such force as to bury itself\ntwo-thirds of its length in it.At the instant of the crash a panic\nhad seized upon the passengers, and a sort of rush had taken place\nto the forward end of the car, into which furniture, fixtures and\nhuman beings were crushed in a shapeless, indistinguishable mass.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Meanwhile the blow had swept away the smoke-stack of the locomotive,\nand its forward truck had been forced back in some unaccountable way\nuntil it rested between its driving wheels and the tender, leaving\nthe entire boiler inside of the passenger car and supported on its\nrear truck.The valves had been so broken as to admit of the free\nescape of the scalding steam, while the coals from the fire-box\nwere scattered among the _d\u00e9bris_, and coming in contact with the\nfluid from the broken car lamps kindled the whole into a rapid\nblaze.Neither was the fire confined to the last car of the train.It has been mentioned that in the block at Everett a locomotive\nreturning to Salem had found itself stopped just in advance of the\naccommodation train.At the suggestion of the engine-driver of that\ntrain this locomotive had there coupled on to it, and consequently\nmade a part of it at Revere.When the collision took place,\ntherefore, the four cars of which the accommodation train was made\nup were crushed between the weight of the entire colliding train on\none side and that of two locomotives on the other.That they were\nnot wholly demolished was due simply to the fact that the last car\nyielded to the blow, and permitted the locomotive of the express\ntrain fairly to imbed itself in it.As it was, the remaining cars\nwere jammed and shattered, and, though the passengers in them\nescaped, the oil from the broken lamps ignited, and before the\nflames could be extinguished the cars were entirely destroyed.This accident resulted in the death of twenty-nine persons, and\nin more or less severe injuries to fifty-seven others.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.No person,\nnot in the last car of the accommodation train was killed, and\none only was seriously injured.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Of those in the last car more\nthan half lost their lives; many instantly by crushing, others by\ninhaling the scalding steam which poured forth from the locomotive\nboiler into the wreck, and which, where it did not kill, inflicted\nfrightful injuries.Indeed, for the severity of injuries and for the\nprotractedness of agony involved in it, this accident has rarely, if\never, been exceeded.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.Crushing, scalding and burning did their work\ntogether.It may with perfect truth be said that the disaster at Revere marked\nan epoch in the history of railroad development in New England.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.At\nthe moment it called forth the deepest expression of horror and\nindignation, which, as usual in such cases, was more noticeable for\nits force than for its wisdom.An utter absence of all spirit of\njustice is, indeed, a usual characteristic of the more immediate\nutterances, both from the press and on the platform, upon occasions\nof this character.Writers and orators seem always to forget that,\nnext to the immediate sufferers and their families, the unfortunate\nofficials concerned are the greatest losers by railroad accidents.For them, not only reputation but bread is involved.A railroad\nemploy\u00e9 implicated in the occurrence of an accident lives under a\nstigma.And yet, from the tenor of public comment it might fairly be\nsupposed that these officials are in the custom of plotting to bring\ndisasters about, and take a fiendish delight in them.Nowhere was\nthis ever illustrated more perfectly than in Massachusetts during\nthe last days of August and the early days of September, 1871.Grave\nmen--men who ought to have known better--indulged in language which\nwould have been simply ludicrous save for the horror of the event\nwhich occasioned but could not justify it.A public meeting, for\ninstance, was held at the town of Swampscott on the evening of the\nMonday succeeding the catastrophe.The gentleman who presided over\nit very discreetly, in his preliminary remarks, urged those who\nproposed to join in the discussion to control their feelings.Hardly\nhad he ceased speaking, however, when Mr.Wendell Phillips was\nnoticed among the audience, and immediately called to the platform.His remarks were a most singular commentary on the chairman's\ninjunction to calmness.He began by announcing that the first\nrequisite to the formation of a healthy public opinion in regard\nto railroad accidents, as other things, was absolute frankness of\nspeech, and he then proceeded as follows:--\"So I begin by saying\nthat to my mind this terrible disaster, which has made the last\nthirty-six hours so sad to us all, is a deliberate murder.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.I think\nwe should try to get rid in the public mind of any real distinction\nbetween the individual who, in a moment of passion or in a moment of\nheedlessness, takes the life of one fellow-man, and the corporation\nthat in a moment of greed, of little trouble, of little expense, of\nlittle care, of little diligence, takes lives by wholesale.I think\nthe first requisite of the public mind is to say that there is no\naccident in the case, properly speaking.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.It is a murder;

F. Butler, for instance,\nsuggested his view of the disaster and the measure best calculated\nto prevent a repetition of it; which last was certainly original,\ninasmuch as he urged the immediate raising of the pay of all\nengine-men until a sufficiently high order of ability and education\nshould be brought into the occupation to render impossible the\nrecurrence of an accident which was primarily caused by the\nnegligence, not of an engineer, but of a conductor.Another\ngentleman described with much feeling his observations during a\nrecent tour in Europe, and declared that such a catastrophe as that\nat Revere would have been impossible there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.As a matter of fact\nthe official reports not only showed that the accident was one of\na class of most frequent occurrence, but also that sixty-one cases\nof it had occurred in Great Britain alone during the very year the\ngentleman in question was journeying in Europe, and had occasioned\nover six hundred cases of death or personal injury.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Perhaps, in\norder to illustrate how very reckless in statement a responsible\ngentleman talking under excitement may become, it is worth while to\nquote in his own language Captain Tyler's brief description of one\nof those sixty-one accidents which \"could not possibly,\" but yet\ndid, occur.\"As four London & North-Western excursion trains on September\n     2, 1870, were returning from a volunteer review at Penrith,\n     the fourth came into collision at Penruddock with the third of\n     those trains.An hundred and ten passengers and three servants\n     of the company were injured.These trains were partly in charge\n     of acting guards, some of whom were entirely inexperienced, as\n     well in the line as in their duties; and of engine-drivers and\n     firemen, of whom one, at all events, was very much the worse for\n     liquor.The side-lamps on the hind van of the third train were\n     obscured by a horse-box, which was wider than the van.There\n     were no special means of protection to meet the exceptional\n     contingency of three such trains all stopping on their way from\n     the eastward, to cross two others from the westward, at this\n     station.And the regulations for telegraphing the trains were\n     altogether neglected.\"The annals of railroad accidents are full of cases of \"rear-end\ncollision,\" as it is termed.[11] Their frequency may almost be\naccepted as a very accurate gauge of the pressure of traffic on\nany given system of lines, and because of them the companies are\ncontinually compelled to adopt new and more intricate systems of\noperation.At first, on almost all roads, trains follow each other\nat such great intervals that no precaution at all, other than flags\nand lanterns, are found necessary.Then comes a succeeding period\nwhen an interval of time between following trains is provided for,\nthrough a system of signals which at given points indicate danger\nduring a certain number of minutes after the passage of every\ntrain.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.Then, presently, the alarming frequency of rear collisions\ndemonstrates the inadequacy of this system, and a new one has to be\ndevised, which, through the aid of electricity, secures between the\ntrains an interval of space as well as of time.This last is known\nas the \"block-system,\" of which so much has of late years been heard.[11] In the nine years 1870-8, besides those which occurred and\n  were not deemed of sufficient importance to demand special inquiry,\n  86 cases of accidents of this description were investigated by the\n  inspecting officers of the English Board of Trade and reported upon\n  in detail.In America, 732 cases were reported as occurring during\n  the six years 1874-8, and 138 cases in 1878 alone.The block-system is so important a feature in the modern operation\nof railroads, and in its present stage of development it illustrates\nso strikingly the difference between the European and the American\nmethods, that more particular reference will have presently to be\nmade to it.[12] For the present it is enough to say that rear-end\ncollisions occur notwithstanding all the precautions implied in a\nthoroughly perfected \"block-system.\"There was such a case on the\nMetropolitan road, in the very heart of London, on the 29th of\nAugust, 1873.A train was stalled there,\nand an unfortunate signal officer in a moment of flurry gave \"line\nclear\" and sent another train directly into it.A much more impressive disaster, both in its dramatic features\nand as illustrating the inadequacy of every precaution depending\non human agency to avert accident under certain conditions, was\nafforded in the case of a collision which occurred on the London\n& Brighton Railway on August 25, 1861; ten years almost to a day\nbefore that at Revere.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.Like the Eastern railroad, the London\n& Brighton enjoyed an enormous passenger traffic, which became\npeculiarly heavy during the vacation season towards the close of\nAugust; and it was to the presence of the excursion trains made\nnecessary to accomodate this traffic that the catastrophes were\nin both cases due.In the case of the London & Brighton road it\noccurred on a Sunday.An excursion train from Portsmouth on that\nday was to leave Brighton at five minutes after eight A. M., and\nwas to be followed by a regular Sunday excursion train at 8.15 or\nten minutes later, and that again, after the lapse of a quarter of\nan hour, by a regular parliamentary train at 8.30.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.These trains\nwere certainly timed to run sufficiently near to each other; but,\nowing to existing pressure of traffic on the line, they started\nalmost simultaneously.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.The Portsmouth excursion, which consisted of\nsixteen carriages, was much behind its time, and did not leave the\nBrighton station until 8.28; when, after a lapse of three minutes,\nit was followed by the regular excursion train at 8.31, and that\nagain by the parliamentary train at 8.35.Three passenger trains had\nthus left the station on one track in seven minutes!The London and\nBrighton Railway traverses the chalky downs, for which that portion\nof England is noted, through numerous tunnels, the first of which\nafter leaving Brighton is known as the Patcham Tunnel, about five\nhundred yards in length, while two and a half miles farther on is\nthe Croydon Tunnel, rather more than a mile and a quarter in length.The line between these tunnels was so crooked and obscured that the\nmanagers had adopted extraordinary precautions against accident.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.At\neach end of the Croydon Tunnel a signal-man was stationed, with a\ntelegraphic apparatus, a clock and a telegraph bell in his station.The rule was absolute that when any train entered the tunnel the\nsignal-man at the point of entry was to telegraph \"train in,\" and\nno other train could follow until the return signal of \"train out\"\ncame from the other side.In face of such a regulation it was\ndifficult to see how any collision in the tunnel was possible.When\nthe Portsmouth excursion train arrived, it at once entered the\ntunnel and the fact was properly signaled to the opposite outlet.Before the return signal that this train was out was received, the\nregular excursion train came in sight.It should have", "question": "Where is Sandra?

which consequently still indicated safety when the\nBrighton excursion train came up.Accordingly the engine-driver\nat once passed it, and went on to the tunnel.As he did so, the\nsignal-man, perceiving some mistake and knowing that he had not yet\ngot his return signal that the preceding train was out, tried to\nstop him by waving his red flag.It was too late, however, and the\ntrain passed in.A moment later the parliamentary train also came\nin sight, and stopped at the signal of danger.Now ensued a most\nsingular misapprehension between the signal-men, resulting in a\nterrible disaster.The second train had run into the tunnel and was\nsupposed by the signal-man to be on its way to the other end of it,\nwhen he received the return message that the first train was out.To this he instantly responded by again telegraphing \"train in,\"\nreferring now to the second train.This dispatch the signal-man\nat the opposite end conceived to be a repetition of the message\nreferring to the first train, and he accordingly again replied that\nthe train was out.This reply, however, the other operator mistook\nas referring to the second train, and accordingly he signaled\n\"safety,\" and the third train at once got under way and passed into\nthe tunnel.Unfortunately the engineer of the second train had\nseen the red flag waved by the signal-man, and, in obedience to\nit, stopped his locomotive as soon as possible in the tunnel and\nbegan to back out of it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.In doing so, he drove his train into the\nlocomotive of the third train advancing into it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.The tunnel was\ntwenty-four feet in height.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something\n to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole\n house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing\n our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.\u2018DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow\n since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in\n three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it\n has been, Amy dear.You

hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at\n Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.They gave us a\n very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the\n _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the\n day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight\n hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we\n unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice\n hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck\n the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating\n rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.\u2018The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being\n brought back five versts.Then we were told to\n send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the\n _personnel_.The whole country was covered with\n groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Russians, Serbs, and\n Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through\n the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places\n the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were\n throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,\n being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way\n of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on\n to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head\n over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different\n stories of our groups.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.My special lot slept the first night on straw\n in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the\n next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in\n barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent\n the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in\n Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that\n place, and there we have been ever since.\u2018We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an\n officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official\n figures are 7000).<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.They had been working thirty-six hours without\n stopping when we arrived.\u2018The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in\n their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.\u2018So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the\n trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing\n I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were\n evacuated straight to Odessa.\u2018The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through\n

a real building, but it is not finished.One\n unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,\n though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought\n it was a mere

can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable\n way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,\n twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we\n cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,\n and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem\n to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and\n telegraphed, and

mistake, we were sent flying\n right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,\n and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we\n left.I\u2019ll tell you the

afterwards.Perhaps, however,\n they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the\n crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able\n to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and\n pots and pans and pigs.\u2018In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,\n sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were\n little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as\n gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of\n carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what\n the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,\n is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have\n got to help these people, because

the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,\n and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across\n the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The\n Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in\n seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I\n would not have missed it for anything.The

and her deft fingers\nspeedily wrought such a transformation in the work that the owner made\nan exclamation of delight.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.At this the twins left their turkey to come\nover and look, and even Samantha at last quitted the stove and sauntered\nto the window with an exaggerated show of indifference.She looked on\nfor a moment, and then returned with a supercilious sniff, which scared\nthe twins also away.When the hat was finished, and Lucinda had tried it\non with obvious satisfaction, Jessica asked her to go for a little walk,\nand the two went out together.There was a certain physical relief in escaping from the close and\nevil-smelling kitchen into the keen, clear cold, but of mental comfort\nthere was little.The sister had nothing beyond a few commonplaces to\noffer in the way of conversation, and Jessica was in no mood to create\nsmall-talk.She walked vigorously forward as far as the sidewalks were\nshovelled, indifferent to direction and to surroundings, and intent only\nupon the angry and distracting thoughts which tore one another in her\nmind.It was not until the drifts forced them to turn that she spoke.\u201cI always dread to get downright mad: it makes me sick,\u201d she exclaimed,\nin defiant explanation to the dull Lucinda, who did not seem to have\nenjoyed her walk.\u201cIf I was you, I wouldn\u2019t mind \u2019em,\u201d said the sister.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.\u201cYou just keep a stiff upper lip and tend to your own knitting, and\nthey\u2019ll be coming around in no time to get you to fix their bonnets for\n\u2019em.I bet you Samanthy\u2019ll have her brown plush hat to pieces, and be\nbringing it to you before Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have to bring it to me somewhere else, then.To-day\u2019s my last\nday in _that_ house, and don\u2019t you forget it!\u201d\n\nJessica spoke with such vehemence that Lucinda could only stare at her\nin surprise, and the town girl went excitedly on: \u201cWhen I saw father\nyesterday, I was almost glad I\u2019d come back;

and there he found his\nmother weeping; a thing he had not seen her do ever since the\nfather's death.He turned back again, just as though he did not\nnotice it; but he felt the mother was looking sorrowfully after him,\nand he was obliged to stop.She did not answer, and\nall was silent in the room.Then his words came back to him again,\nand he felt they had not been spoken so kindly as they ought; and\nonce more, in a gentler tone, he asked, \"What are you crying for,\nmother?\"\"Ah, I hardly know,\" she said, weeping still more.He stood silent a\nwhile; but at last mustered courage to say, \"Still, there must be\nsome reason why you are crying.\"Again there was silence; but although the mother had not said one\nword of blame, he felt he was very guilty towards her.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.\"Well it just\ncame over me,\" she said after a while; and in a few moments she\nadded, \"but really, I'm very happy;\" and then she began weeping\nagain.Arne hurried out, away to the ravine; and while he sat there looking\ninto it, he, too, began weeping.\"If I only knew what I am crying\nfor,\" he said.Then he heard Opplands-Knut singing in the fields above him:\n\n   \"Ingerid Sletten of Willow-pool\n      Had no costly trinkets to wear;\n      But a cap she had that was far more fair,\n    Although 'twas only of wool.It had no trimming, and now was old;\n      But her mother, who long had gone,\n      Had given it her, and so it shone\n    To Ingerid more than gold.For twenty years she laid it aside,\n      That it might not be worn away:\n      'My cap I'll wear on that blissful day\n    When I shall become a bride.'For thirty years she laid it aside\n      Lest the colors might fade away:\n      'My cap I'll wear when to God I pray,\n    A happy and grateful bride.'For forty years she laid it aside,\n      Still holding her mother as dear:\n      'My little cap, I certainly fear\n    I never shall be a bride.'She went to look for the cap one day\n      In the chest where it long had lain;\n      But, ah!her looking was all in vain:\n    The cap had mouldered away.\"Arne listened, and the words seemed to him like music playing far\naway over the mountains.He went up to Knut and asked him, \"Have you\na mother?\"\"Ah, yes; it's long since.\"\"You haven't many, I dare say, who love you?\"\"Haven't you any at all then who love you?\"\"Ah, no; I haven't any.\"But Arne walked away with his heart so full of love to his mother\nthat it seemed as if it would burst; and all around him grew bright.He felt he must go in again, if only for the sake of looking at her.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.As he walked on the thought struck him, \"What if I were to lose her?\"\"Almighty God, what would then become of me?\"Then he felt as if some dreadful accident was happening at home, and\nhe hurried onwards, cold drops bursting from his brow, and his feet\nhardly touching the ground.He threw open the outer door, and came at\nonce into an atmosphere of peace.Then he gently opened the door of\nthe inner room.The mother had gone to bed, and lay sleeping as\ncalmly as a child, with the moonbeams shining full on her face.A few days after, the mother and son agreed on going together to the\nwedding of some relations in one of the neighboring places.The\nmother had not been to a party ever since she was a girl; and both\nshe and Arne knew but very little of the people living around, save\ntheir names.Arne felt uncomfortable at this party, however, for he fancied\neverybody was staring at him: and once, as he was passing through the\npassage, he believed he heard something said about him, the mere\nthought of which made every drop of blood rush into his face.He kept going about looking after the man who had said it, and at\nlast he took a seat next him.When they were at dinner, the man said, \"Well, now, I shall tell you\na story which proves nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't\none day be brought to light;\" and Arne fancied he looked at him all\nthe time he was saying this.He was an ugly-looking man, with scanty\nred hair, hanging about a wide, round forehead, small, deep-set eyes,\na little snub-nose, and a large mouth, with pale out-turned lips,\nwhich showed both his gums when he laughed.His hands were resting on\nthe table; they were large and coarse, but the wrists were slender.He had a fierce look; and he spoke quickly, but with difficulty.The\npeople called him \"Bragger;\" and Arne knew that in bygone days, Nils,\nthe tailor, had treated him badly.\"Yes,\" continued the man, \"there is indeed, a great deal of sin in\nthe world;

and\nthat, everybody knew, he didn't take to for nothing--nobody does.\"Just at this time the road over the ledge had to be altered.Folks\nin bygone days had a great fancy for going straight onwards; and so\nthe old road ran straight over the ledge; but now-a-days we like to\nhave things smooth and easy; and so the new road was made to run down\nalong the river.While they were making it, there was digging and\nmining enough to bring down the whole mountain about their ears; and\nthe magistrates and all the officers who have to do with that sort of\nthing were there.One day while the men were digging deep in the\nstony ground, one of them took up something which he thought was a\nstone; but it turned out to be the bones of a man's hand instead; and\na wonderfully strong hand it seemed to be, for the man who got it\nfell flat down directly.The magistrate\nwas just strolling about round there, and they fetched him to the\nplace; and then all the bones belonging to a whole man were dug out.The Doctor, too, was fetched; and he put them all together so\ncleverly that nothing was wanting but the flesh.And then it struck\nsome of the people that the skeleton was just about the same size\nand make as Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say.\"And then it struck somebody else, that it was a very queer thing a\ndead hand should have made a great fellow like Big Lazy-bones fall\nflat down like that: and the magistrate accused him straight of\nhaving had more to do with that dead hand than he ought--of course,\nwhen nobody else was by.But then Big Lazy-bones foreswore it with\nsuch fearful oaths that the magistrate turned quite giddy.'Well,'\nsaid the magistrate, 'if you didn't do it, I dare say you're a\nfellow, now, who would not mind sleeping with the skeleton\nto-night?'--'No; I shouldn't mind a bit,--not I,' said Big\nLazy-bones.So the Doctor tied the joints of the skeleton together,\nand laid it in one of the beds in the barracks; and put another bed\nclose by it for Big Lazy-bones.The magistrate wrapped himself in his\ncloak, and lay down close to the door outside.When night came on,\nand Big Lazy-bones had to go in to his bedfellow, the door shut\nbehind him as though of itself, and he stood in the dark.But then\nBig Lazy-bones set off singing psalms, for he had a mighty voice.'May be the bells were never tolled for him,' answered Big\nLazy-bones.Then he began praying out loud, as earnestly as ever he\ncould.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.asked the magistrate from outside the\nwall.'No doubt, he has been a great sinner,' answered Big\nLazy-bones.Then a time after, all got so still that the magistrate\nmight have gone to sleep.But then came a shrieking that made the\nvery barracks shake: 'I'll call again!'--Then came a hellish noise\nand crash: 'Out with that fifty dollars of mine!'roared Big\nLazy-bones: and the shrieking and crashing came again.Then the\nmagistrate burst open the door; the people rushed in with poles and\nfirebrands; and there lay Big Lazy-bones on the floor, with the\nskeleton on the top of him.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.There was a deep silence all round the table.At last a man who was\nlighting his clay-pipe said, \"Didn't he go mad from that very time?\"Arne fancied everybody was looking at him, and he dared not raise his\neyes.\"I say, as I said before,\" continued the man who had told the\ntale, \"nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't one day be\nbrought to light.\"\"Well, now I'll tell you about a son who beat his own father,\" said a\nfair stout man with a round face.Arne no longer knew where he was\nsitting.\"This son was a great fellow, almost a giant, belonging to a tall\nfamily in Hardanger; and he was always at odds with somebody or\nother.He and his father were always quarrelling about the yearly\nallowance; and so he had no peace either at home or out.\"This made him grow more and more wicked; and the father persecuted\nhim.'I won't be put down by anybody,' the son said.'Yes, you'll be\nput down by me so long as I live,' the father answered.'If you don't\nhold your tongue,' said the son, rising, 'I'll strike you.'--'Well,\ndo if you dare; and never in this world will you have luck again,'\nanswered the father, rising also.--'Do you mean to say that?'said\nthe son; and he rushed upon him and knocked him down.But the father\ndidn't try to help himself: he folded his arms and let the son do\njust as he liked with him.Then he knocked him about, rolled him over\nand over, and dragged him towards the door by his white hair.'I'll\nhave peace in my own house, at any rate,' said he.But when they had\ncome to the door, the father raised himself a little and cried out,\n'Not beyond the door, for so far I dragged my own father.'The son\ndidn't heed it, but dragged the old man's head over the threshold.And the old man rose, knocked down the\nson and beat him as one would beat a child.\"\"Ah, that's a sad story,\" several said.Then Arne fancied he heard\nsome one saying, \"It's a wicked thing to strike one's father;\" and he\nrose, turning deadly pale.\"Now I'll tell _you_ something,\" he said;

and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the\nnunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the\nred tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the\nroof.After the consecration we were separated, and only one of the girls\nremained with me.We were put into a large\nroom, where were three beds, one large and two small ones.In the large\nbed the Superior slept, while I occupied one of the small beds and the\nother little nun the other.Our new Superior was very strict, and we\nwere severely punished for the least trifle--such, for instance, as\nmaking a noise, either in our own room or in the kitchen.We might not\neven smile, or make motions to each other, or look in each other's face.We must keep our eyes on our work or on the floor, in token of humility.To look a person full in the face was considered an unpardonable act of\nboldness.On retiring for the night we were required to lie perfectly\nmotionless.We might not move a hand or foot, or even a finger.At\ntwelve the bell rang for prayers, when we must rise, kneel by our beds,\nand repeat prayers until the second bell, when we again retired to rest.On cold winter nights these midnight prayers were a most cruel penance.It did seem as though I should freeze to death.But live or die, the\nprayers must be said, and the Superior was always there to see that we\nwere not remiss in duty.If she slept at all I am sure it must have\nbeen with one eye open, for she saw everything.But if I obeyed in this\nthing, I found it impossible to lie as still as they required; I would\nmove when I was asleep without knowing it.This of course could not be\nallowed, and for many weeks I was strapped down to my bed every night,\nuntil I could sleep without the movement of a muscle.I was very anxious\nto do as nearly right as possible, for I thought if they saw that I\nstrove with all my might to obey, they would perhaps excuse me if I did\nfail to conquer impossibilities.In this, however, I was disappointed;\nand I at length became weary of trying to do right, for they would\ninflict severe punishments for the most trifling accident.In fact, if\nI give anything like a correct account of my convent life, it will be\nlittle else than a history of punishments.Pains, trials, prayers, and\nmortifications filled up the time.Penance was the rule, to escape it\nthe exception.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.I neglected at the proper time to state what name was given me when I\ntook the veil;

how\nmuch more so when no change can be effected, but the same set of muscles\nkept continually on the stretch for the space of twenty-four hours!Moreover, I knew not how long I should be kept there.The other\nprisoners, whose agonizing cries fell upon my ears, were evidently\nsuffering all the horrors of starvation.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.Were those terrible sufferings in reserve for me?And then came the thought so often present with me while in the\nconvent, \"If there is a God in heaven, why does He permit such things?What have I done that I should become the victim of such cruelty?I involuntarily exclaimed, \"save me from this terrible death.\"At the close of twenty-four\nhours, the Lady Superior came and released me from my prison, told me to\ngo to the priest and ask his forgiveness, and then go to my work in the\nkitchen.I was very faint and weak from my long fast, and I resolved\nnever to offend again.I verily thought I could be careful enough to\nescape another such punishment.But I had not been in the kitchen one\nhour, when I chanced to let a plate fall upon the floor.It was in\nno way injured, but I had broken the rules by making a noise, and the\nSuperior immediately reported me to the priest.He soon appeared with\nhis bunch of keys and a dark lantern in his hand.He took me by the ear\nwhich he pinched till he brought tears to my eyes, saying, \"You don't\ntry to do well, and I'll make you suffer the consequences.\"I did not\nreply, for I had learned that to answer a priest, or seek to vindicate\nmyself, or even to explain how things came to be so, was in itself\na crime, to be severely punished.However unjust their treatment,\nor whatever my feelings might be, I knew it was better to suffer in\nsilence.Unlocking a door that opened out of the kitchen, and still keeping hold\nof my ear, he led me into a dark, gloomy hall, with black walls, and\nopening a door on the right, he bade me enter.This room was lighted\nby a candle, and around the sides, large iron hooks with heavy chains\nattached to them, were driven into the wall.At the back part of the\nroom, he opened the door, and bade me enter a small closet.He then put\na large iron ring over my head, and pressed it down upon my shoulders.Heavy weights were placed in my hands, and I was told to stand up\nstraight, and hold them fifteen minutes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.Had my\nlife depended upon the effort, I could not have stood erect, with those\nweights in my hands.The priest, however, did not reprove me.Perhaps he\nsaw that I exerted all my strength to obey, for he took out his watch,\nand slowly counted the minutes as they passed.Ere a third part of the\ntime expired, he was obliged to release me, for the blood gushed from\nmy nose and mouth, and I began to feel faint and dizzy.The irons were\nremoved, and the blood ceased to flow.I was then taken to another room, lighted like the other, but it was\ndamp and cold, and pervaded by a strong, fetid, and very offensive odor.The floor was of wood, and badly stained with blood.At least, I\nthought it was blood, but there was not light enough to enable me to\nsay positively what it was.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.In the middle of the room, stood two long\ntables, on each of which, lay a corpse, covered with a white cloth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.The\npriest led me to these tables, removed the cloth and bade me look upon\nthe face of the dead.They were very much emaciated, and the features,\neven in death, bore the impress of terrible suffering.We stood there a\nfew moments, when he again led me back to his own room.He then asked\nme what I thought of what I had seen.Having taken no food for more than\ntwenty-four hours, I replied, \"I am so hungry, I can think of nothing\nelse.\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.\"How would you like to eat those dead bodies?\"\"I would\nstarve, Sir, before I would do it,\" I replied.\"Yes indeed,\" I exclaimed, striving to suppress my\nindignant feelings.F", "question": "Where is Daniel?

and remember,\" he added significantly, \"you will do it too\nif you are not careful.\"He then ordered me to return to the kitchen.At ten o'clock in the morning, the nuns had a slice of bread and cup\nof water; but, as I had been fasting, they gave me a bowl of gruel,\ncomposed of indian meal and water, with a little salt.A poor dinner\nthis, for a hungry person, but I could have no more.At eleven, we went\nto mass in the chapel as usual.It was our custom to have mass\nevery day, and I have been told that this is true of all Romish\nestablishments.Returning to my work in the kitchen, I again resolved\nthat I would be so careful, that, in future they should have no cause\nfor complaint For two days I succeeded.Yes, for two whole days, I\nescaped punishment.This I notice as somewhat remarkable, because I was\ngenerally punished every day, and sometimes two or three times in a day.On the third morning, I was dusting the furniture in the room occupied\nby the priest above mentioned, who treated me so cruelly.The floor\nbeing uncarpeted, in moving the chairs I chanced to make a slight noise,\nalthough I did my best to avoid it.He immediately sprang to his feet,\nexclaiming, \"You careless dog!<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Then taking me\nby the arms, he gave me a hard shake, saying, \"Have I not told you that\nyou would be punished, if you made a noise?But I see how it is with\nyou;

he kept near me and drove\nme before him into the priests sitting-room.He then sent for three more\npriests, to decide upon my punishment.A long consultation they held\nupon \"this serious business,\" as I sneeringly thought it, but the result\nwas serious in good earnest, I assure you.For the heinous offence of\nmaking a slight noise I was to have dry peas bound upon my knees, and\nthen be made to crawl to St.Patrick's church, through an underground\npassage, and back again.This church was situated on a hill, a little\nmore than a quarter of a mile from the convent.Between the two\nbuildings, an under-ground passage had been constructed, just large\nenough to allow a person to crawl through it on the hands and knees.It\nwas so low, and narrow, that it was impossible either to rise, or turn\naround; once within that passage there was no escape, but to go on to\nthe end.They allowed me five hours to go and return; and to prove that\nI had really been there, I was to make a cross, and two straight lines,\nwith a bit of chalk, upon a black-board that I should find at the end.O, the intolerable agonies I endured on that terrible pathway!Any\ndescription that I can give, will fail to convey the least idea of the\nmisery of those long five hours.It may, perchance, seem a very simple\nmode of punishment, but let any one just try it, and they will be\nconvinced that it was no trifling thing.At the end, I found myself in\na cellar under the church, where there was light enough to enable me to\nfind the board and the chalk.I made the mark according to orders, and\nthen looked around for some means of escape.Strong iron bars firmly secured the only door, and a very slight\nexamination convinced me that my case was utterly hopeless.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.I then tried\nto remove the peas from my swollen, bleeding limbs, but this, too, I\nfound impossible.They were evidently fastened by a practised hand; and\nI was, at length, compelled to believe that I must return as I came.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.I\ndid return; but O, how, many times I gave up in despair, and thought\nI could go no further!<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.How many times did I stretch myself on the cold\nstones, in such bitter agony, that I could have welcomed death as a\nfriend and deliverer!What would I not have given for one glass of cold\nwater, or even for a breath of fresh air!My limbs seemed on fire,\nand while great drops of perspiration fell from my face, my throat and\ntongue were literally parched with thirst.But the end came at last, and\nI found the priest waiting for me at the entrance.He seemed very angry,\nand said, \"You have been gone over your time.There was no need of it;\nyou could have returned sooner if you had chosen to do so, and now,\nI shall punish you again, for being gone so long.\"At first, his\nreproaches grieved me, for I had done my best to please him, and I did\nso long for one word of sympathy, it seemed for a moment, as though my\nheart would break.Had he then spoken one kind word to me, or manifested\nthe least compassion for my sufferings, I could have forgiven the past,\nand obeyed him with feelings of love and gratitude for the future.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Yes,\nI would have done anything for that man, if I could have felt that he\nhad the least pity for me;

whereas, the cost of apparatus for the\nuse of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed \u00a35; and indeed,\non most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even\nwithout any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that\na transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with\nevery thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while\non shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the\nrequisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the\n10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need\nspecifying.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,\nwhen compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch\nspherical carcass costs \u00a31.17_s._ 11\u00bd_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the\n32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible\nmatter, does not cost more than \u00a31.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case\nthere is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11\u00bd_d._ Now the large\nRocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the\ndifference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the\ndifferent quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the\ndifference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least\ndouble, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the\nother comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15\nto 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in\nthe first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate\neconomy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to\nthe still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the\nfirst cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than \u00a33.10_s._ that is to\nsay, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,\nthough its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter\nconveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration\nare half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is\nevident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets\nmay be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling\nmass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch\nshell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or\nconflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the\nfirst cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a\ncomparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the\nRocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average", "question": "Where is John? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "But as to the Rocket\nand its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is\nthat of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly\nstated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under\nany circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by\n32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving\nof \u00a33 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger\nnatures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the\nspherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but\ngreatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,\nas the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not\nworthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired\nfrom a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each\nother, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a\nseries of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the\nground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some\naccident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to\nsay, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing\nof shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the\nRocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is\nscarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion\nof the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the\nsaving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with\nreference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the\nlarge mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole\nestablishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their\nunfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every\nvessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without\nany alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her\ngeneral services.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket\nin bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense\nof this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common\nartillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the\nRocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired\nfrom field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily\nused by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make\nthe calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common\nammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small\nRocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give\nhorizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the\ngun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be\nstated as follows:--\n\n                                           \u00a3._s._  _d._\n                      {Case and stick      0    5     6\n  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10\u00bd\n                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0\n                                          --------------\n                                          \u00a30    9     4\u00bd\n                                          --------------\n\nBut this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting\nelementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of\nthe stick.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom._s._  _d._\n                    {Case and stick  0   4     0\n  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10\u00bd\n                    {Driving         0   0     6\n                                    -------------\n                                    \u00a30   6     4\u00bd\n                                    -------------\n\n    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general\n        calculation of the advantages of which the system is\n        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether\nprojected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the\nRocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4\u00bd_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the\ngunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated\nas follows:--\n\n                                                         \u00a3._s._  _d._\n  6-pounder Amm\u2019n.{Charge of powder for the 6-pounder   0   2     0\n                    {Cartridge, 3\u00bd_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     7\u00bc\n                    {  2\u00bd_d._ and tube, 1\u00bc_d._\n                                                         -------------\n                                                         \u00a30   2     7\u00bc\n                                                         -------------\n\n                                                         \u00a3._s._  _d._\n  9-pounder Amm\u2019n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0\n                    {Cartridge, 4\u00bd_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8\u00bc\n                    {  2\u00bd_d._ and tube, 1\u00bc_d._\n                                                         -------------\n                                                         \u00a30   3     8\u00bc\n                                                         -------------\n\nTaking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,\nthe Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2\u00be_d._ a round more than the common\nammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the\nexpensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference\nof first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first\nplace, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no\napparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it\nis of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and\ncavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their\nother powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged\nwith the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can\n_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the\nuse of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,\ntransport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,\nor of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What\nproportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and\nthe average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to\nthe heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It\nis a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not\namount to less than \u00a320 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the\npay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from\n\u00a32 to \u00a33 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not\nperhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that\nthe saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the\nfield as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare\nquestion of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not\nthe balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_\nfacilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_\nof the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire\nto be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by\nany possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to\nall these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be\nstated", "question": "Where is John?
