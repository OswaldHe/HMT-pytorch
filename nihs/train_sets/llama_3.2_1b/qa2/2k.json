She looked up timidly into Virginia's face, and\nhero-worship got the better of prudence.The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came\nback from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one.It\nstill stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and\nvery wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall\nand broad, and a high basement.Two stately stone porches capped by\nelaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.In short, the house is of that type built\nby many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best\nstood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would\nnot clash with the architectural education which we are receiving.A\nspacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall\nof dressed stones, capped by an iron fence.The whole expressed wealth,\nsecurity, solidity, conservatism.Alas, that the coal deposits under\nthe black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven\nthe owners of these houses out of them!They are now blackened, almost\nburied in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the\nold families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with\na sigh.The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and\nwest-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came\nin sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them.Talk\nwas rife over the commanding general's pomp and circumstance.He had\njust returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military\nwere wedded.Foreign officers should come to America to teach our\narmy dress and manners.A dashing Hungarian commanded the general's\nbody-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street\nbefore the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd\nthat feared to jest.They felt like it save when they caught the stern\nmilitary eye of the Hungarian captain.Virginia gazed at the glittering\nuniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses,\nand scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of\nSouthern patriots on the burning prairies.Just then a sharp command\nescaped in broken English from the Hungarian.The people in the yard of\nthe mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the\ngate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter.As he put\nfoot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again\nto be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff,\nwho smiled and began to walk toward them.Little Eugenie's knees\ntrembled.She seized Virginia's arm, and whispered in agony.\"Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all.Oh, I wish you hadn't\nbeen so bold!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.\"Hush,\" said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with\na look.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the\ninsolence of that smile.How dare he march undaunted to within six paces\nof those eyes?The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat?\"Oh, I hope he will arrest me,\" she said passionately, to Eugenie.\"He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell.\"No, those were not\nthe words, surely.He bowed very\nlow and said:\n\n\"Ladies, the General's compliments, and he begs that this much of the\nsidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments.\"What was left for them, after that, save a retreat?Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing\nwhich drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.And there she\nstood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away.A\ncrowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers\nin uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards.One\ncivilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the\ngate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down\nthe side street.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise,\nstartled her.\"May I have the pleasure,\" said that gentleman, \"of accompanying you\nhome?\"<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.\"You must not come out of your way,\" she said.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.\"I am\nsure you must go back to the store.Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave\nEliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him.His was a nature\nwhich liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for\nsweet girls;

for we know, that Pyes and Parrots can utter words\neven as we can, and yet cannot speak like us; that is to say, with\nevidence that they think what they say.Whereas Men, being born deaf and\ndumb, and deprived of those organs which seem to make others speak, as\nmuch or more then beasts, usually invent of themselves to be understood\nby those, who commonly being with them, have the leisure to learn their\nexpressions.And this not onely witnesseth, that Beasts have lesse\nreason than men, but that they have none at all.For we see there needs\nnot much to learn to speak: and forasmuch as we observe inequality\namongst Beasts of the same kind, aswell as amongst men, and that some\nare more easily managed then others; 'tis not to be believed, but that\nan Ape or a Parrot which were the most perfect of its kinde, should\ntherein equall the most stupid child, or at least a child of a\ndistracted brain, if their souls were not of a nature wholly different\nfrom ours.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.And we ought not to confound words with naturall motions,\nwhich witness passions, and may be imitated by Machines aswell as by\nAnimals; nor think (as some of the Ancients) that beasts speak, although\nwe do not understand their language: for if it were true, since they\nhave divers organs which relate to ours, they could aswell make\nthemselves understood by us, as by their like.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.Its likewise very\nremarkable that although there are divers creatures which express more\nindustry then we in some one of their actions; yet we may well perceive,\nthat the same shew none at all in many others: So that what they do\nbetter then we, proves not at all that they have reason; for by that\nreckoning they would have more then any of us, and would do better in\nall other things; but rather, that they have none at all, and that its\nNature onely which works in them according to the disposition of their\norgans.As wee see a Clock, which is onely composed of wheels and\nsprings, can reckon the hours, and measure the times more exactly then\nwe can with all our prudence.After this I had described the reasonable Soul, and made it appear, that\nit could no way be drawn from the power of the Matter, as other things\nwhereof I had spoken; but that it ought to have been expresly created:\nAnd how it suffiseth not for it to be lodg'd in our humane body as a\nPilot in his ship, to move its members onely; but also that its\nnecessary it be joyned and united more strongly therewith to have\nthoughts and appetites like ours, and so make a reall man.I have here dilated my self a little on the subject of the Soul, by\nreason 'tis of most importance; for, next the errour of those who deny\nGod, which I think I have already sufficiently confuted, there is none\nwhich sooner estrangeth feeble minds from the right way of vertue, then\nto imagine that the soul of beasts is of the same nature as ours, and\nthat consequently we have nothing to fear nor hope after this life, no\nmore then flies or ants.Whereas, when we know how different they are,\nwe comprehend much better the reasons which prove that ours is of a\nnature wholly independing from the body, and consequently that it is not\nsubject to die with it.And that when we see no other cause which\ndestroys it, we are naturally thence moved to judge that it's immortall.Its now three years since I ended the Treatise which contains all these\nthings, and that I began to review it, to send it afterwards to the\nPresse, when I understood, that persons to whom I submit, and whose\nauthority can no lesse command my actions, then my own Reason doth my\nthoughts, had disapproved an opinion in Physicks, published a little\nbefore by another;

notwithstanding the great care I always had to admit no new\nones into my belief, of which I had not most certain demonstrations; and\nnot to write such as might turn to the disadvantage of any body.Which\nwas sufficient to oblige me to change my resolution of publishing them.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.For although the reasons for which I had first of all taken it, were\nvery strong; yet my inclination, which alwayes made me hate the trade of\nBook-making, presently found me out others enough to excuse my self from\nit.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.And these reasons on the one and other side are such, that I am not\nonly somewhat concern'd to speak them; but happily the Publick also to\nknow them.I never did much esteem those things which proceeded from mine own\nbrain; and so long as I have gathered no other fruits from the Method I\nuse, but onely that I have satisfied my self in some difficulties which\nbelong to speculative Sciences, or at least endeavoured to regulate my\nManners by the reasons it taught me, I thought my self not obliged to\nwrite any thing of them.For, as for what concerns Manners, every one\nabounds so much in his own sense, That we may finde as many Reformers as\nheads, were it permitted to others, besides those whom God hath\nestablished as Soveraigns over his people, or at least, to whom he hath\ndispensed grace and zeal enough to be Prophets, to undertake the change\nof any thing therein.And although my Speculations did very much please\nme, I did beleeve that other men also had some, which perhaps pleas'd\nthem more.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.But as soon as I had acquired some generall notions touching\nnaturall Philosophy, and beginning to prove them in divers particular\ndifficulties, I observed how far they might lead a man, and how far\ndifferent they were from the principles which to this day are in use; I\njudg'd, that I could not keep them hid without highly sinning against\nthe Law, which obligeth us to procure, as much as in us lies, the\ngeneral good of all men.For they made it appear to me, that it was\npossible to attain to points of knowledge, which may be very profitable\nfor this life: and that in stead of this speculative Philosophy which is\ntaught in the Schools, we might finde out a practicall one, by which\nknowing the force and workings of Fire, Water, Air, of the Starrs, of\nthe Heavens, and of all other Bodies which environ us, distinctly, as we\nknow the several trades of our Handicrafts, we might in the same manner\nemploy them to all uses to which they are fit, and so become masters and\npossessours of Nature.Which is not onely to be desired for the\ninvention of very many expedients of Arts, which without trouble might\nmake us enjoy the fruits of the earth, and all the conveniences which\nare to be found therein: But chiefly also for the preservation of\nhealth, which (without doubt) is the first good, and the foundation of\nall other good things in this life.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.For even the minde depends so much\non the temper and disposition of the organs of the body, that if it be\npossible to finde any way of making men in the generall wiser, and more\nable then formerly they were, I beleeve it ought to be sought in\nPhysick.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.True it is, that which is now in use contains but few things,\nwhose benefit is very remarkable: But (without any designe of slighting\nof it) I assure my self, there is none, even of their own profession,\nbut will consent, that whatsoever is known therein, is almost nothing in\ncompanion of what remains to be known.And that we might be freed from\nvery many diseases, aswell of the body as of the mind, and even also\nperhaps from the weaknesses of old age, had we but knowledge enough of\ntheir Causes, and of all the Remedies wherewith Nature hath furnished\nus.Now having a designe to employ all my life in the enquiry of so\nnecessary a Science; and having found a way, the following of which me\nthinks might infallibly lead us to it, unless we be hindred by the\nshortness of life, or by defect of experiments.I judg'd that there was\nno better Remedie against those two impediments, but faithfully to\ncommunicate to the publique, all that little I should discover, and to\ninvite all good Wits to endevour to advance farther in contributing\nevery one, according to his inclination and power, to those Experiments\nwhich are to be made, and communicating also to the publique all the\nthings they should learn; so that the last, beginning where the\nprecedent ended, and so joyning the lives and labors of many in one, we\nmight all together advance further then any particular Man could do.I also observ'd touching Experiments, that they are still so much the\nmore necessary, as we are more advanc'd in knowledg.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.For in the\nbeginning it's better to use those only which of themselves are\npresented to our senses, and which we cannot be ignorant of, if we do\nbut make the least reflections upon them, then to seek out the rarest\nand most studied ones.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football there.The reason whereof is, that those which are\nrarest, doe often deceive, when we seldome know the same of the most\ncommon ones, and that the circumstances on which they depend, are, as it\nwere, always so particular, and so small, that it's very uneasie to\nfinde them out.First, I\nendevoured to finde in generall the Principles or first Causes of\nwhatsoever is or may be in the world, without considering any thing for\nthis end, but God alone who created it, or drawing them elsewhere, then\nfrom certain seeds of Truth which naturally are in our souls.After\nthis, I examined what were the first and most ordinary Effects which\nmight be deduced from these Causes: And me thinks that thereby I found\nout Heavens, Starrs, an Earth; and even on the Earth, Water, Air and\nFire, Minerals, and some other such like things, which are the most\ncommon, and the most simple of all, and consequently the most easie to\nbe understood.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.Afterwards, when I would descend to those which were more\nparticular, there were so many severall ones presented themselves to me,\nthat I did beleeve it impossible for a humane understanding to\ndistinguish the forms and species of Bodies which are on the earth, from\nan infinite number of others which might be there, had it been the will\nof God so to place them: Nor by consequence to apply them to our use,\nunless we set the Effects before the Causes, and make use of divers\nparticular experiments; In relation to which, revolving in my minde all\nthose objects which ever were presented to my senses, I dare boldly say,\nI observed nothing which I could not fitly enough explain by the\nprinciples I had found.But I must also confesse that the power of\nNature is so ample and vast, and these principles are so simple and\ngenerall, that I can observe almost no particular Effect, but that I\npresently know", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "In fine, I am gotten so far, That (me thinks)\nI see well enough what course we ought to hold to make the most part of\nthose experiments which may tend to this effect.But I also see they\nare such, and of so great a number, that neither my hands nor my estate\n(though I had a thousand times more then I have) could ever suffice for\nall.So that according as I shall hereafter have conveniency to make\nmore or fewer of them, I shall also advance more or lesse in the\nknowledge of Nature, which I hop'd I should make known by the Treatise\nwhich I had written; and therein so clearly shew the benefit which the\nPublick may receive thereby, that I should oblige all those in general\nwho desire the good of Mankinde; that is to say, all those who are\nindeed vertuous, (and not so seemingly, or by opinion only) aswell to\ncommunicate such experiments as they have already made, as to help me in\nthe enquiry of those which are to be made.But since that time, other reasons have made me alter my opinion, and\nthink that I truly ought to continue to write of all those things which\nI judg'd of any importance, according as I should discover the truth of\nthem, and take the same care, as if I were to print them; as well that I\nmight have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as\nwithout doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the\npublick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and\noftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first\nconceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing\nthem to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the\nPublick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,\nthose to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what\nuse of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published\nduring my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto\nperhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it\nwere, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of\nmispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for\nalthough it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in\nhim lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is\nproperly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought\nto reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those\nthings which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are\nalive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more\nadvantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that\nthe little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of\nwhat I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For\nit's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the\ntruth in Learning;

opposed by about an equal\nnumber of Indians.Marshall, with\nabout 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded\nin utterly routing them.Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty\nwounded.This was the only real battle of the war.Other Day was with\nthe whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter.Pope, who was in command of the department of the\nNorthwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was\nover and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his\ncommand.Pope was met with a decided remonstrance\nby the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the\nremoval of any of the troops until they had made two long marches\nthrough the Dakotas and to Montana.Sibley's command reached Camp\nRelease on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was\nlocated a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the\nmassacres.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods\nand white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to\nprecede at once to their rescue.Sibley was of the opinion that\nany hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the\nprisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution.After a\nfew preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the\ncaptives were released.Sibley made inquiries\nas to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes\nrecently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of\nthem had been guilty of the grossest atrocities.The general decided\nto form a military tribunal and try the offenders.After a series of\nsittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November,\n321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of\nwhom were sentenced to death and the rest condemned to various terms\nof imprisonment according to their crimes.All of the condemned\nprisoners were taken to Mankato and were confined in a large jail\nconstructed for the purpose.After the court-martial had completed\nits work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities,\na great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale\nslaughter of the beloved red man.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the apple there.The Quakers of Philadelphia and the\ngood people of Massachusetts sent many remonstrances to the president\nto put a stop to the proposed wholesale execution.The president,\nafter consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the\nexecution of

prisoners were interviewed\nby Rev.Riggs, to whom they made their dying confessions.Nearly\nevery one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to\nthem.Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and\nwhen speaking of their wives and children almost every one was\naffected to tears.Most of them spoke confidently of their hope of\nsalvation, and expected to go at once to

the city, where they were all\ndumped into the same hole.They did not remain there long, but were\nspirited away by students and others familiar with the use of a\ndissecting knife.Little Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection was not with the\nnumber that surrendered, but escaped and was afterward killed by a\nfarmer named Lamson, in the vicinity of Hutchinson.His scalp is now\nin the state historical society.Little Crow was born in Kaposia, a\nfew miles below St.Paul, and was always known as a bad Indian.Little\nCrow's father was friendly to the whites, and it was his dying wish\nthat his son should assume the habits of civilized life and accustom\nhimself to the new order of things, but the dying admonitions of the\nold man were of little avail and Little Crow soon became a dissolute,\nquarrelsome and dangerous Indian.He was opposed to all change of\ndress and habits of life, and was very unfriendly to missionaries and\nteachers.He was seldom known to tell the truth and possessed very few\nredeeming qualities.Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians,\nhe was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent\nassumed the direction of all

railroads, and the only way to\ntransport provisions was by wagon.An order was issued by the military\nauthorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose,\nbut the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient\nalacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it\nwas necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly\nimpressing into service of the government any and all teams that could\nbe found on the streets or in stables.A detachment of Company K of\nthe Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the\ncity several days on that especial duty.As soon as the farmers heard\nthat the government was taking possession of everything that came over\nthe bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried\nit to Hastings.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.There was one silver-haired farmer living near the\ncity limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with\nthe South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could\nnot locate his team.One of the members of Company K was a former\nneighbor of the disloyal farmer, and he made it his particular duty\nto see that this team, at least, should be loyal to the government.A\nclose watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down\nto the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where\nhe thought they would be safe until he returned.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.As soon as the old\nman passed over the bridge the squad took possession of his horses,\nand when he returned the team was on the way to Abercrombie laden\nwith supplies for the troops at the fort.Of course the government\nsubsequently reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but in\nthis particular case the soldiers did not think the owner deserved it.Ramsey's carriage team was early taken possession of by the\nmilitary squad, and when the driver gravely informed the officer in\ncharge that the governor was the owner of that team and he thought it\nexempt from military duty, he was suavely informed that a power\nhigher than the governor required that team and that it must go

Gosford's\nperiod of office, was to do everything in his power to conciliate the\nCanadian _Patriotes_, short of making any real constitutional\nconcessions.By means of a conciliatory attitude he hoped to induce\nthem to abate some of their demands.There is, indeed, evidence that\nhe was personally willing to go further: he seems to have proposed to\nWilliam IV that the French Canadians should be granted, as they\ndesired, an elective Legislative Council; but the staunch old Tory king\nwould not hear of the change.'The king objects on principle,' the\nministers were told, 'and upon what he {47} considers sound\nconstitutional principle, to the adoption of the elective principle in\nthe constitution of the legislative councils in the colonies.'In 1836\nthe king had not yet become a negligible factor in determining the\npolicy of the government; and the idea was dropped.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.Lord Gosford arrived in Canada at the end of the summer of 1835 to find\nhimself confronted with a discouraging state of affairs.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.A short\nsession of the Assembly in the earlier part of the year had been marked\nby unprecedented violence.Papineau had attacked Lord Aylmer in\nlanguage breathing passion; and had caused Lord Aylmer's reply to the\naddress of the Assembly containing the Ninety-Two Resolutions to be\nexpunged from the journals of the House as 'an insult cast at the whole\nnation.'Papineau had professed himself hopeless of any amendment of\ngrievances by Great Britain.'When Reform ministries, who called\nthemselves our friends,' he said, 'have been deaf to our complaints,\ncan we hope that a Tory ministry, the enemy of Reform, will give us a\nbetter hearing?We have nothing to expect from the Tories unless we\ncan inspire them with fear or worry them by ceaseless importunity.'It\n{48} should be observed, however, that in 1835 Papineau explicitly\ndisclaimed any intention of stirring up civil war.When Gugy, one of\nthe English members of the Assembly,[1] accused him of such an\nintention, Papineau replied:\n\n\nMr Gugy has talked to us again about an outbreak and civil war--a\nridiculous bugbear which is regularly revived every time the House\nprotests against these abuses, as it was under Craig, under Dalhousie,\nand still more persistently under the present governor.Doubtless the\nhonourable gentleman, having studied military tactics as a lieutenant\nin the militia--I do not say as a major, for he has been a major only\nfor the purposes of the parade-ground and the ball-room--is quite\ncompetent to judge of the results of a civil war and of the forces of\nthe country, but he need not fancy that he can frighten us by hinting", "question":

and of course\nhe could not foresee that only two years later Conrad Gugy would be one\nof the first to enter the village of St Eustache after the defeat of\nthe _Patriote_ forces.In spite of the inflamed state of public feeling, Lord Gosford tried to\nput into effect his policy of conciliation.He sought to win the\nconfidence of the French Canadians by presiding at their\nentertainments, by attending the distribution of prizes at their\nseminaries, and by giving balls on their feast days.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.He entertained\nlavishly, and his manners toward his guests were decidedly convivial.'_Milord_,' exclaimed one of them on one occasion, tapping him on the\nback at a certain stage of the after-dinner conversation, '_milord,\nvous etes bien aimable_.'<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.'Pardonnez,' replied Gosford; '_c'est le\nvin_.'<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Even Papineau was induced to accept the governor's hospitality,\nthough there were not wanting those who warned Gosford that Papineau\nwas irreconcilable.'By a wrong-headed and melancholy alchemy,' wrote\nan English officer in Quebec to Gosford, 'he will transmute every\npublic concession into a demand for more, in a ratio equal to its\nextent; and his disordered moral palate, beneath the blandest smile and\nthe {50} softest language, will turn your Burgundy into vinegar.'The speech with which Lord Gosford opened the session of the\nlegislature in the autumn of 1835 was in line with the rest of his\npolicy.He announced his determination to effect the redress of every\ngrievance.In some cases the action of the executive government would\nbe sufficient to supply the remedy.In others the assistance of the\nlegislature would be necessary.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.A third class of cases would call for\nthe sanction of the British parliament.He promised that no\ndiscrimination against French Canadians should be made in appointments\nto office.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.He expressed the opinion that executive councillors should\nnot sit in the legislature.He announced that the French would be\nguaranteed the use of their native tongue.He made an earnest plea for\nthe settlement of the financial difficulty, and offered some\nconcessions.The legislature should be given control of the hereditary\nrevenues of the Crown, if provision were made for the support of the\nexecutive and the judiciary.Finally, he made a plea for the\nreconciliation of the French and English races in the country, whom he\ndescribed as 'the offspring of the two foremost nations {51} of\nmankind.'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.Not even the most extreme of the _Patriotes_ could fail to\nsee that Lord Gosford was holding out to them an olive branch.Great dissatisfaction, of course, arose among the English in the colony\nat Lord Gosford's policy.'Constitutional associations,' which had\nbeen formed in Quebec and Montreal for the defence of the constitution\nand the rights and privileges of the English-speaking inhabitants of\nCanada, expressed gloomy forebodings as to the probable result of the\npolicy.The British in Montreal organized among themselves a volunteer\nrifle corps, eight hundred strong, 'to protect their persons and\nproperty, and to assist in maintaining the rights and principles\ngranted them by the constitution'; and there was much indignation when\nthe rifle corps was forced to disband by order of the governor, who\ndeclared that the constitution was in no danger, and that, even if it\nwere, the government would be competent to deal with the situation.Nor did Gosford find it plain sailing with all the French Canadians.Papineau's followers in the House took up at first a distinctly\nindependent attitude.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk.Gosford was informed {52} that the appointment\nof the royal commission was an insult to the Assembly; it threw doubt\non the assertions which Papineau and his followers had made in\npetitions and resolutions.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.If the report of the commissioners turned\nout to be in accord with the views of the House, well and good; but if\nnot, that would not influence the attitude of the House.In spite, however, of the uneasiness of the English official element,\nand the obduracy of the extreme _Patriotes_, it is barely possible that\nGosford, with his _bonhomie_ and his Burgundy, might have effected a\nmodus vivendi, had there not occurred, about six months after Gosford's\narrival in Canada, one of those unfortunate and unforeseen events which\nupset the best-laid schemes of mice and men.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.This was the indiscreet\naction of Sir Francis Bond Head, the newly appointed\nlieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, in communicating to the\nlegislature of Upper Canada the _ipsissima verba_ of his instructions\nfrom the Colonial Office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.It was immediately seen that a discrepancy\nexisted between the tenor of Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions and\nthe tenor of Lord Gosford's speech at the opening of the legislature of\nLower Canada in 1835.{53} Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions showed\nbeyond peradventure that the British government did not contemplate any\nreal constitutional changes in the Canadas; above all, it did not\npropose to yield to the demand for an elective Legislative Council.This fact was called to the attention of Papineau and his friends by\nMarshall Spring Bidwell, the speaker of the Assembly of Upper Canada;\nand immediately the fat was in the fire.Papineau was confirmed in his\nbelief that justice could not be hoped for; those who had been won over\nby Gosford's blandishments experienced a revulsion of feeling; and\nGosford saw the fruit of his efforts vanishing into thin air.Lord Gosford had asked the\nAssembly to vote a permanent civil list, in view of the fact that the\ngovernment offered to hand over to the control of the legislature the\ncasual and territorial revenues of the Crown.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.But the publication of\nSir Francis Bond Head's instructions effectually destroyed any hope of\nthis compromise being accepted.In the session of the House which was\nheld in the early part of 1836, Papineau and his friends not only\nrefused to vote a permanent civil {54} list; they declined to grant\nmore than six months' supply in any case; and with this they made the\nthreat that if the demands of the _Patriotes_ were not met at the end\nof the six months, no more supplies would be voted.This action was\ndeemed so unsatisfactory that the Legislative Council threw out the\nbill of supply.The result was widespread distress among the public\nofficials of the colony.This was the fourth year in which no\nprovision had been made for the upkeep of government.In 1833 the bill\nof supply had been so cumbered with conditions that it had been\nrejected by the Legislative Council.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.In 1834, owing to disputes\nbetween the Executive and the Assembly, the legislature had separated\nwithout a vote on the estimates.In 1835 the Assembly had declined to\nmake any vote of supply.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.In earlier years the Executive had been able,\nowing to<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.", "question": "Where is the milk?

that the attention of the Assembly had been called to\nthe arrears due; and that the Assembly had declined to vote a supply\nuntil its demands for radical political changes were satisfied.The\nresolutions declared that though both the bodies in question might be\nimproved in respect of their composition, it {59} was inadvisable to\ngrant the demand to make the Legislative Council elective, or to\nsubject the Executive Council to the responsibility demanded by the\nHouse of Assembly.In regard to the financial question, the\nresolutions repeated the offer made by Lord Aylmer and Lord\nGosford--namely, to hand over to the Assembly the control of the\nhereditary, territorial, and casual revenues of the Crown, on condition\nthat the Assembly would grant a permanent civil list.But the main\nfeature of the resolutions was the clause empowering the governor to\npay out of the public revenues, without authorization of the Assembly,\nthe moneys necessary for defraying the cost of government in the\nprovince up to April 10, 1837.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.This, though not exactly a suspension\nof the constitution of Lower Canada and a measure quite legally within\nthe competency of the House of Commons, was a flat negative to the\nclaim of the Lower-Canadian Assembly to control over the executive\ngovernment, through the power of the purse or otherwise.A long and important debate in Parliament followed on these\nresolutions.Some of the chief political leaders of the day took part\nin the discussion.Daniel O'Connell, the great {60} tribune of the\nIrish people, took up the cudgels for the French Canadians.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the milk.Doubtless\nit seemed to him that the French Canadians, like the Irish, were\nvictims of Anglo-Saxon tyranny and bigotry.Sir George Grey, the\ncolleague of Gosford, Lord Stanley, a former colonial secretary, and\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, then a vigorous young Tory, spoke in support\nof the resolutions.The chief opposition came from the Radical wing of\nthe Whig party, headed by Hume and Roebuck; but these members were\ncomparatively few in number, and the resolutions were passed by\noverwhelming majorities.From a print in the Chateau de Ramezay.]<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.As soon as the passage of the resolutions became known in Canada,\nPapineau and his friends began to set the heather on fire.On May 7,\n1837, the _Patriotes_ held a huge open-air meeting at St Ours, eleven\nmiles above Sorel on the river Richelieu.The chief organizer of the\nmeeting was Dr Wolfred Nelson, a member of the Assembly living in the\nneighbouring village of St Denis, who was destined to be one of the\nleaders of the revolt at the end of the year.Papineau himself was\npresent at the meeting and he spoke in his usual violent strain.It is obvious, therefore, that in any comparison made of the powers\nof the Rocket with those of common artillery, whether an officer be\ncalled on merely to demonstrate its powers, or to carry it actually\nagainst an enemy, the foregoing maxim must be his rule; in fact, every\nthing should be demonstrated according to the spirit of its use; a\nsingle Rocket is not to be compared with a single gun shot, by firing\nit at a target.But the consideration is, whether for general service,\nthe power of quantity in the fire of Rockets does not _at least_\ncounterbalance the greater accuracy of the gun?and for this purpose\nthe spirit of the demonstration of the Rocket system is to shew how\nfew men are required to produce the most powerful vollies with this\narm.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.No demonstration should be made with less than twenty rounds in a\nvolley; to maintain which, in any fixed position, at the rate of two or\neven three vollies a minute, twenty men may be said to be sufficient,\nand this with Rockets projecting cohorn, or 5\u00bd-inch howitzer shells,\nor even 18 and 24-pounder solid shot.The first point of comparison,\ntherefore, is", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "But independent of this comparison as to quantity, there are others\nin which the Rocket has advantages exclusively its own: there are\nsituations where artillery cannot by any means be brought into action,\nwhile there is no situation, no nature of ground, which is passable\nto an infantry soldier with his musket in his hand, that is not\nequally to be passed by the Rocketteer with _his_ arm and ammunition.For the accomplishment of any particular service, he may dispense\nentirely with wheel carriages or even horses; there is nothing which\nthe men themselves cannot transport and bring into action; and if any\nbombardment were required by a _coup de main_, 1,000 men would not\nonly convey 1,000 rounds of the heaviest Carcass Rockets, a number\nsufficient to destroy any place within the compass of their range, but\nwould perform that service in a few hours, having neither batteries or\nplatforms to erect, nor mortars to convey.Such are the true principles of this new system of artillery, for\n(projecting the same ammunition) so it may be called, and the greater\nthe scale of equipment, the greater in proportion will its powers\nappear; thus, if an establishment were formed on the strength of a\ncavalry regiment, if 600 mounted men were equipped on the principles of\nthe present detachment, they would take into action, without ammunition\nhorses or wheel carriages, 2,400 rounds of ammunition, and 200 abouches\na f\u00e9u; and if 100 ammunition horses were attached to this corps, it\nwould further possess a reserve of nearly 2,000 rounds more: the whole\ncapable of every movement and service practicable by any other regiment\nof heavy cavalry; and the same proportionate power would be found to\nattach to every other mode of equipment.In addition to this view of the powers of the weapon, it is important\nto state, that the detail of the service is most extraordinarily\nsimple; that there are but a few points to be attended to in its\napplication; and those such as may be most easily acquired; the\nprincipal ones are, that care must be taken to fix the sticks very\nfirmly to the Rocket, and in the true direction of the axis of the\nRocket, to prevent aberration of flight.That, at high angles, the frame must always be elevated for the large\nRockets from 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 more than the elevation at which the Rocket is\nintended to be projected, and in the small Rockets from 2\u00bd\u00b0 to 5\u00b0; for,\nas the Rocket leaves the frame before it has obtained its full force,\nit drops a certain number of degrees in proportion to its weight at\ngoing off.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.Thus the longest ranges of the 32-pounder Carcass Rockets\nare obtained at about 55\u00b0, or rather more, if the Rockets have been\nlong made.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.An officer, however, being prepared for this circumstance,\nwill soon discover the maximum range of the Rockets he may have to\ndischarge.Some allowance in elevation also must be made for the direction of the\nwind: if it is powerful, and blows in a contrary direction to that in\nwhich the Rocket is projected, the frame requires _more_ elevation;\nfor the wind acting more on the stick than the body of the Rocket,\ndepresses the elevation in its rising.If, on the contrary, it blows\nin the direction of the Rocket\u2019s flight, _less_ elevation is required;\nfor, in this case, the Rocket mounts by the wind\u2019s action on the\nstick.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.So, from the same cause, if the wind be strong, and across\nthe range, though no difference of elevation is necessary, still an\nallowance must be made to leeward; for the Rocket, contrary to the\ncourse of ordinary projectiles, has a tendency to draw to windward: a\nfew rounds, however, in all these cases, will immediately point out to\nthe observant officer what is the required allowance.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.These remarks\nrefer only to high angles; for no effect whatever is produced by the\nwind in the ground-ranges: in these the only caution necessary to be\nattended to is, to chuse the most smooth and level spot for the first\n100 yards in front of the point from which it is intended to discharge\nthese Rockets, as they generally travel in contact with the surface for\nthis distance, not having acquired their full force, and are therefore\nmore liable to deflection; but having at this point acquired a velocity\nnot much less than the mean velocity of a cannon ball, they are not to\nbe more easily deflected: at this distance also they rise a few feet\nfrom the ground, so as to clear any ordinary obstacles that may occur;\ninsomuch that, if it were desired to fire Rockets at low angles into a\nbesieged town, from the third parallel, these Rockets, having a clear\nspace to acquire their velocity, in front of the parallel, would run up\nthe glacis, clear the ditch, and skim over the parapet into the town;\nand would no doubt be of great use in a variety of cases, particularly\nin discomfiting and rendering the enemy unsteady, by pouring in\nvollies of some hundreds or even thousands on this principle, previous\nto an assault or escalade: indeed, knowing the effect, I do not\nhesitate to affirm that this man\u0153uvre, practised _on the great scale_,\nwould infallibly dislodge any enemy posted for the protection of a\nbreach.Sufficient has, I conceive, now been stated, to give the officer such a\ngeneral view of the power and spirit of the weapon, as may enable him\nto apply it in all possible cases to the best advantage; and if he will\nbut constantly bear in view that maxim which I have laid down as the\nfundamental principle of this system, I will confidently pledge myself\nthat it will never disappoint him, either as to the physical or _moral_\neffect which he may calculate on producing upon his enemy; since, he\nmust recollect, that for this latter effect, it adds all the terrors of\n_visibility_ to every species of that destructive ammunition introduced\nby the use of gunpowder, but by every one admitted hitherto to have\nbeen qualified, as to moral effect, by its _invisibility_._25th October, 1813._\n\n                    W.

for the latter of these purposes, also, the flap\nof the saddle comes further forward than usual.The holsters, thus\nconnected, slip on and off from the pummel with great facility, which\nis an object of importance, as a part of the service of the Rocket\ntrooper is, when from some impassable obstacle, he can no longer\nadvance on horseback, to dismount and pass over such obstacle, with\nhis ammunition holsters and chamber, on foot.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.The sticks, which are\nseven feet in length, and four in number, answering to the number of\nRockets, are collected in a bundle by means of a strap with four loops,\ncontrived on purpose, and are carried on the off-side, the thicker ends\nbeing supported in a bucket, suspended from the flap of the saddle,\nthe strap above mentioned, as confining them together in the middle,\nleading across the man\u2019s thigh to the peak of the saddle; by this means\nthey fall naturally under his right arm, without at all incommoding\nhim, either in mounting or dismounting, or even in going through the\nsword exercise.By this arrangement also, they are easily drawn from\nthe bundle downwards, for fixing to the Rocket, leaving any number that\nmay remain as securely fixed as when the whole are in the quiver.It has already been stated, that the men are told off in sections of\nthrees.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.They are accordingly numbered 1, 2, and 3.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.Now numbers 1 and\n3 have nothing to carry but their proportion of the ammunition, viz.four Rockets and four sticks each, while No.2 has in addition to\ncarry the chamber from which the Rockets of his section are discharged.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.This chamber is a small iron plate trough, about one foot six inches\nin length, capable of being fixed steadily in the ground by four iron\npoints at the bottom of it, so that the Rockets may be discharged\nparallel to the surface and close to it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.The weight of this chamber, or\nbouche a fe\u00f9, is about six lbs.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.and it is carried in a small leather\ncase, shewn in both these figures, just at the back of the valise.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.The men are armed with a sabre, which is in action suspended to the\nsaddle, that they may not be incumbered in mounting and dismounting.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.Each man has besides a pistol in his cross belt, and a spear head in\nhis holster, which may be occasionally fixed at the end of one of the\nRocket sticks, so as to give the further aid of a very formidable\nlance.Instead of carrying slow match, which would be dangerous as\nwell as inconvenient, the portfire is lighted in action by a flash of\npowder obtained from a pistol lock and pan, mounted on a small stock;\nand a light portfire stick for discharging the Rocket, about three feet\nin length, is constructed of a thin iron tube, which shuts up, and is\ncarried in the holster.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.The sticks are fastened in the loops on the\nRocket case, either by the gripe of a pair of pincers with points in\nthem, or by the stroke of a small hammer with a point in the head, or\nby some equally simple tool.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Every part of this equipment, except the\nsticks, is so completely concealed by the shabracque, that the Rocket\ntrooper has the appearance merely of a lancer.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.The weight of ammunition carried by the troop horse, with the full\ncomplement going into action, is three stone six lbs.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.;

the former is called the _upper_, and the\nlatter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass\nthrough the points farthest east and west from the meridian.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.The former\nis called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,\nor at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too\ncomplicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or\nlower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this\ninvolves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude\nof the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and\nmoreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to\nthe place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,\nan error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would\nintroduce an error of one minute of arc.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.If the observation be made,\nhowever, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,\nthat is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the\nerror of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be\ninappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make\nthe observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be\ngiven.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the\nrelative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,\nand Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is\nhorizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the\nlatter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will\nbe necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be\nturned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.This angle,\ncalled the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the\nobserver, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be\ncomputed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his\n_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the\ncelestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;\nthen N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the\nlatitude 40 deg.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle\nof the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the\nlatitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,\npreceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called\nthe _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a\nplane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the\nnormal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,\nhence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith\nand nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object\nis its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical\ncircle.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the\ndifference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith\ndistance_, or _co-altitude_.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane\nthrough the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the\nhorizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at\n90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the\nposition of any object with reference to the observer's place.The\nlatter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude\nreferred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,\nand the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to\nthe latitude of the place of observation_.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,\nin which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1\nwill be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,\nand Q1 Z the latitude of Z.

with the mysterious, cavern not yet\naccounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she\nhad seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but\nwe

and I feel sure, whatever you may feel diplomatically, I\n     have your support, and that of every man professing himself a\n     gentleman, in private.\"Eight days later he succeeded in getting another message through, to\nthe following effect:--\n\n     \"As far as I can understand, the situation is this.You state\n     your intention of not sending any relief up here or to Berber,\n     and you refuse me Zebehr.I consider myself free to act according\n     to circumstances.I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I\n     can suppress the rebellion I shall do so.If I cannot, I shall\n     retire to the Equator and leave you the indelible disgrace of\n     abandoning the garrisons of Senaar, Kassala, Berber, and Dongola,\n     with the _certainty_ that you will eventually be forced to smash\n     up the Mahdi under greater difficulties if you wish to maintain\n     peace in, and, indeed, to retain Egypt.\"Before a silence of five and a half months fell over Khartoum, Gordon\nhad been able to make three things clear, and of these only one could\nbe described as having a personal signification, and that was that the\nGovernment, by rejecting all his propositions, had practically\nabandoned him to his fate.The two others were that any settlement\nwould be a work of time, and that no permanent tranquillity could be\nattained without overcoming the Mahdi.Immediately on arriving at Khartoum he perceived that the evacuation\nof the Soudan, with safety to the garrison and officials, as well as\nthe preservation of the honour of England and Egypt, would necessarily\nbe a work of time, and only feasible if certain measures were taken in\nhis support, which, considerable as they may have appeared at the\nmoment, were small and costless in comparison with those that had\nsubsequently to be sanctioned.Six weeks sufficed to show Gordon that\nhe would get no material help from the Government, and he then began\nto look elsewhere for support, and to propound schemes for pacifying\nthe Soudan and crushing the Mahdi in which England and the Government\nwould have had no part.Hence his proposal to appeal to wealthy\nphilanthropists to employ Turkish troops, and in the last resort to\nforce his way to the Equator and the Congo.Even that avenue of safety\nwas closed to him by the illusory prospect of rescue held out to him\nby the Government at the eleventh hour, when success was hardly\nattainable.For the sake of clearness it will be well to give here a brief summary\nof the siege during the six months that followed the arrival of\nGeneral Gordon and the departure of Colonel Stewart on 10th September.The full and detailed narrative is contained in Colonel Stewart's\nJournal, which was captured on board his steamer.This interesting\ndiary was taken to the Mahdi at Omdurman, and is said to be carefully\npreserved in the Treasury.The statement rests on no very sure\nfoundation, but if true the work may yet thrill the audience of the\nEnglish-speaking world.But even without its aid the main facts of the\nsiege of Khartoum, down at all events to the 14th December, when\nGordon's own diary stops, are sufficiently well known for all the\npurposes of history.At a very early stage of the siege General Gordon determined to try\nthe metal of his troops, and the experiment succeeded to such a\nperfect extent that there was never any necessity to repeat it.On\n16th March, when only irregular levies and detached bodies of\ntribesmen were in the vicinity of Khartoum, he sent out a force of\nnearly 1000 men, chiefly Bashi-Bazouks, but also some regulars, with a\nfieldpiece and supported by two steamers.The force started at eight\nin the morning, under the command of Colonel Stewart, and landed at\nHalfiyeh, some miles down the stream on the right bank of the Nile.Here the rebels had established a sort of fortified position, which it\nwas desirable to destroy, if it could be done without too much loss.The troops were accordingly drawn up for the attack, and the gun and\ninfantry fire commenced to cover the advance.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.At this moment about\nsixty rebel horsemen came out from behind the stockade and charged the\nBashi-Bazouks, who fired one volley and fled.The horsemen then\ncharged the infantry drawn up in square, which they broke, and the\nretreat to the river began at a run.Discouraging as this was for a\nforce of all arms to retire before a few horsemen one-twentieth its\nnumber, the disaster was rendered worse and more disheartening by the\nconduct of the men, who absolutely refused to fight, marching along\nwith shouldered arms without firing a shot, while the horsemen picked\noff all who straggled from the column.The gun, a considerable\nquantity of ammunition, and about sixty men represented the loss of\nGordon's force; the rebels are not supposed to have lost a single man.\"Nothing could be more dismal than seeing these horsemen, and some men\neven on camels, pursuing close to troops who with shouldered arms\nplodded their way back.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.Thus wrote Gordon of the men to whom he had\nto trust for a successful defence of Khartoum.His most recent\nexperience confirmed his old opinion, that the Egyptian and Arab\ntroops were useless even when fighting to save their own", "question": "Where is the football?

and to the very last day of the siege they\nnever succeeded in getting behind the third of these lines.Their\nefficacy roused Gordon's professional enthusiasm, and in one passage\nhe exclaims that these will be the general form of defence in the\nfuture.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.During the first months of the siege, which began rather in\nthe form of a loose investment, the Nile was too low to allow of his\nusing the nine steamers he possessed, but he employed the time in\nmaking two new ones, and in strengthening them all with bulwarks of\niron plates and soft wood, which were certainly bullet-proof.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Each of\nthese steamers he valued as the equivalent of 2000 men.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.When it is\nseen how he employed them the value will not be deemed excessive, and\ncertainly without them he could not have held Khartoum and baffled all\nthe assaults of the Mahdi for the greater part of a year.After this experience Gordon would risk no more combats on land, and\non 25th March he dismissed 250 of the Bashi-Bazouks who had behaved so\nbadly.Absolutely trustworthy statistics are not available as to the\nexact number of troops in Khartoum or as to the proportion the Black\nSoudanese bore to the Egyptians, but it approximates to the truth to\nsay that there were about 1000 of the former to 3000 of the latter,\nand with other levies during the siege he doubled this total.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.For\nthese and a civilian population of nearly 40,000 Gordon computed that\nhe had provisions for five months from March, and that for at least\ntwo months he would be as safe as in Cairo.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.By carefully husbanding\nthe corn and biscuit he was able to make the supply last much longer,\nand even to the very end he succeeded in partially replenishing the\ndepleted granaries of the town.There is no necessity to repeat the\ndetails of the siege during the summer of 1884.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.They are made up of\nalmost daily interchanges of artillery fire from the town, and of\nrifle fire in reply from the Arab lines.That this was not merely\nchild's play may be gathered from two of Gordon's protected ships\nshowing nearly a thousand bullet-marks apiece.Whenever the rebels\nattempted to force their way through the lines they were repulsed by\nthe mines; and the steamers not only inflicted loss on their fighting\nmen, but often succeeded in picking up useful supplies of food and\ngrain.No further reverses were reported, because Gordon was most\ncareful to avoid all risk, and the only misfortunes occurred in\nGordon's rear, when first Berber, through the treachery of the Greek\nCuzzi, and then Shendy passed into the hands of the Mahdists, thus, as\nGordon said, \"completely hemming him in.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.In April a detached force up\nthe Blue Nile went over to the Mahdi, taking with them a small\nsteamer, but this loss was of no great importance, as the men were of\nwhat Gordon called \"the Arabi hen or hero type,\" and the steamer could\nnot force its way past Khartoum and its powerful flotilla.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.In the four\nmonths from 16th March to 30th July Gordon stated that the total loss\nof the garrison was only thirty killed and fifty or sixty wounded,\nwhile half a million cartridges had been fired against the enemy.The\nconduct of both the people and garrison had been excellent, and this\nwas the more creditable, because Gordon was obliged from the very\nbeginning, owing to the capture of the bullion sent him at Berber, to\nmake all payments in paper money bearing his signature and seal.During that period the total reinforcement to the garrison numbered\nseven men, including Gordon himself, while over 2600 persons had been\nsent out of it in safety as far as Berber.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.The reader will be interested in the following extracts from a letter\nwritten by Colonel Duncan, R.A., M.P., showing the remarkable way in\nwhich General Gordon organised the despatch of these refugees from\nKhartoum.The letter is dated 29th November 1886, and addressed to\nMiss Gordon:--\n\n     \"When your brother, on reaching Khartoum, found that he could\n     commence sending refugees to Egypt, I was sent on the 3rd March\n     1884 to Assouan and Korosko to receive those whom he sent down.As an instance of your brother's thoughtfulness, I may mention\n     that he requested that, if possible, some motherly European woman\n     might also be sent, as many of the refugees whom he had to send\n     had never been out of the Soudan before, and might feel strange\n     on reaching Egypt.A German, Giegler Pasha, who had been in\n     Khartoum with your brother before, and who had a German wife, was\n     accordingly placed at my disposal, and I stationed them at\n     Korosko, where almost all the refugees arrived.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.I may mention\n     that I saw and spoke to every one of the refugees who came down,\n     and to many of the women and children.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Their references to your\n     brother were invariably couched in language of affection and\n     gratitude, and the adjective most frequently applied to him was\n     'just.'<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.In sending away the people from Khartoum, he sent away\n     the Governor and some of the other leading Egyptian officials\n     first.I think he suspected they would intrigue; he always had\n     more confidence in the people than in the ruling Turks or\n     Egyptians.The oldest soldiers, the very infirm, the wounded\n     (from Hicks's battles) were sent next, and a ghastly crew they\n     were.But the precautions he took for their comfort were very\n     complete, and although immediately before reaching me they had to\n     cross a very bad part of the desert between Abou Hamed and\n     Korosko, they reached me in wonderful spirits.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.It was touching to\n     see the perfect confidence they had that the promises of Gordon\n     Pasha would be fulfilled.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football there.After the fall of Khartoum, and your\n     brother's death, a good many of the Egyptian officers who had\n     been with your brother managed to escape, and to come down the\n     river disguised in many cases as beggars.I had an opportunity of\n     talking to most of them, and there was no collusion, for they\n     arrived at different times and by different roads.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.I remember\n     having a talk with one, and when we<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.", "question": "Where is the milk?

Herbin, the French consul, sailed\nnorthwards on five steamers.The first task of this expedition was if\npossible, to retake Berber, or, failing that, to escort the _Abbas_\npast the point of greatest danger; the second, to convey the most\nrecent news about Khartoum affairs to Lower Egypt; and the third was\nto lend a helping hand to any force that might be coming up the Nile\nor across the desert from the Red Sea.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.Five days after its departure\nGordon knew through a spy that Stewart's flotilla had passed Shendy in\nsafety, and had captured a valuable Arab convoy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.It was not till\nNovember that the truth was known how the ships bombarded Berber, and\npassed that place not only in safety, but after causing the rebels\nmuch loss and greater alarm, and then how Stewart and his European\ncompanions went on in the small steamer _Abbas_ to bear the tale of\nthe wonderful defence of Khartoum to the outer world--a defence which,\nwonderful as it was, really only reached the stage of the miraculous\nafter they had gone and had no further part in it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.So far as Gordon's\nmilitary skill and prevision could arrange for their safety, he did\nso, and with success.When the warships had to return he gave them the\nbest advice against treachery or ambuscade:--\"Do not anchor near the\nbank, do not collect wood at isolated spots, trust nobody.\"<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.If they had paid strict heed to his advice, there\nwould have been no catastrophe at Dar Djumna.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.These reflections invest\nwith much force Gordon's own view of the matter:--\"If _Abbas_ was\ncaptured by treachery, then I am not to blame; neither am I to blame\nif she struck a rock, for she drew under two feet of water; if they\nwere attacked and overpowered, then I am to blame.\"So perfect were\nhis arrangements that only treachery, aided by Stewart's\nover-confidence, baffled them.His meeting with the \"little angel,\" as he chose\nto regard her, was an oasis in the desert--a place where his moral\nnature could drink the pure waters of life.No one had ever before seemed to care much whether he was a good boy\nor a bad boy.The minister used now and then to give him a dry\nlecture; but he did not seem to feel any real interest in him.He was\nminister, and of course he must preach; not that he cared whether a\npauper boy was a saint or a sinner, but only to do the work he was\nhired to do, and earn his money.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.Her sweet face was the \"beauty of holiness.\"She\nhoped he was not a bad boy.She liked a good boy; and this was\nincentive enough to incur a lifetime of trial and self-sacrifice.To have one feel an interest in his moral\nwelfare, to have one wish him to be a good boy, had not grown stale by\nlong continuance.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the apple there.He had known no anxious mother, who wished him to be\ngood, who would weep when he did wrong.The sympathy of the little\nangel touched a sensitive chord in his heart and soul, and he felt\nthat he should go forward in the great pilgrimage of life with a new\ndesire to be true to himself, and true to her who had inspired his\nreverence.Even a child cannot be good without having it felt by others.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.\"She\nhoped he was not a bad boy,\" were the words of the little angel; and\nbefore she returned from her errand of mercy, he repeated them to\nhimself a hundred times.They were a talisman to him, and he was sure\nhe should never be a bad boy in the face of such a wish.He wandered about the woods for two or three hours, impatient for the\nreturn of the little rural goddess who had taken possession of his\nthoughts, and filled his soul with admiration.She came at last, and\nglad was the welcome which he gave her.\"I have been thinking of you ever since I left you,\" said Julia, as\nshe approached the place where he had been waiting her return.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.\"I hope you didn't think of me as a bad boy,\" replied he, giving\nexpression to that which was uppermost in his mind.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.I am sure you must be a good boy.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.\"I am glad you think so;

for we cannot always clearly perceive the\ninfluences which assist in forming the character.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.Some trivial event,\nfar back in the past, which inspired him with a new reverence for\ntruth and goodness, may be forgotten.The memory may not now cherish\nthe look, the smile of approbation, which strengthened the heart, when\nit was struggling against the foe within; but its influence was none\nthe less potent.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.\"It is the last pound which breaks the camel's back;\"\nand that look, that smile, may have closed the door of the heart\nagainst a whole legion of evil spirits, and thus turned a life of woe\nand bitterness into a life of sunshine and happiness.There are hundreds of epochs in the experience of every person, boy or\nman--events which raised him up or let him down in the scale of moral\nexistence.Harry West had now reached one of these epochs in his\npilgrimage.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.To meet a little girl in the woods, to kill a black snake, and thus\nrelieve her from a terrible fright, to say the least, was not a great\nevent, as events are reckoned in the world; yet it was destined to\nexert a powerful influence upon his future career.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.It was not the\nmagnitude of the deed performed, or the chivalrous spirit which called\nit forth, that made this a memorable event to Harry; it was the angel\nvisit--the kindling influence of a pure heart that passed from her to\nhim.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.But I suppose the impatient reader will not thank me for\nmoralizing over two whole pages, and I leave the further application\nof the moral to the discretion of my young friends.Harry felt strangely--more strangely than he had ever felt before.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.As\nhe walked back to the cabin everything seemed to have assumed a new\nappearance.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Somehow the trees did not look as they used to look.His being seemed to have undergone a\nchange.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.He could not account for it; perhaps he did not try.He entered the cabin; and, without dropping the train of thought which\nJulia's presence suggested, he busied himself in making the place more\ncomfortable.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football.He shook up the straw, and made his bed, stuffed dried\ngrass into the chinks and crannies in the roof, fastened the door up\nwith some birch withes, and replaced some of the stones of the chimney\nwhich had fallen down.This work occupied him for nearly two hours,\nthough, so busy were his thoughts, they seemed not more than half an\nhour.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.He had scarcely finished these necessary repairs before he heard the\nlight step of her who fed him, as Elijah was fed by the ravens, for it\nseemed like a providential supply.She saw him at the door of the\ncabin; and she no longer dallied with a walk, but ran with all her\nmight.\"O, Harry, I am so glad!\"she cried, out of breath, as she handed him\na little basket, whose contents were carefully covered with a piece of\nbrown paper.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.asked Harry, smiling from sympathy with her.\"I have heard all about it;

and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the\nrain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Latreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and her\ndoors.She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow\nperhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds\nher partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling.When\nshe settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora\npersonata, Illig.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough\nto admit a man's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this\nvegetable paste.On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is\nthen betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid.It is as though the\nauthorities had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of\ngreen wax.So far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom\nI have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building\ncompartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.To the latter belongs Latreille's Osmia.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.The first section includes the\nHorned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia, both so remarkable for the\nhorny tubercles on their faces.The great reed of the south, Arundo donax, is often used, in the\ncountry, for making rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just\nfor fences.These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them\nall the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth.I have\noften explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests.The partitions\nand the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are\nmade, as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces\nto pap.With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the\nopening would receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings\nof the storeys would fall in and the family would perish by drowning.Therefore the Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses\nthe reeds when they are placed perpendicularly.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.The same reed is used for a second purpose.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.We make canisses of it,\nthat is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of\nSilkworms and, in autumn, for the drying of figs.At the end of April\nand during May, which is the time when the Osmiae work, the canisses\nare indoors, in the Silkworm nurseries, where the Bee cannot take\npossession of them; in autumn, they are outside, exposing their layers\nof figs and peeled peaches to the sun; but by that time the Osmiae have\nlong disappeared.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.If, however, during the spring, an old, disused\nhurdle is left out of doors, in a horizontal position, the Three-horned\nOsmia often takes possession of it and makes use of the two ends, where\nthe reeds lie truncated and open.There are other quarters that suit the Three-horned Osmia, who is not\nparticular, it seems to me, and will make shift with any hiding-place,\nso long as it have the requisite conditions of diameter, solidity,\nsanitation and kindly darkness.The most original dwellings that I know\nher to occupy are disused Snail-shells, especially the house of the\nCommon Snail (Helix aspersa).<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Let us go to the <DW72> of the hills thick\nwith olive-trees and inspect the little supporting-walls which are\nbuilt of dry stones and face the south.In the crevices of this\ninsecure masonry we shall reap a harvest of old Snail-shells, plugged\nwith earth right up to the orifice.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.The family of the Three-horned\nOsmia is settled in the spiral of those shells, which is subdivided\ninto chambers by mud partitions.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.The Three-pronged Osmia (O.

I go to Carpentras to glean a\nmore plentiful supply in the nests of the Anthophora.I spread out my\nstock in a large open box on a table which receives a bright diffused\nlight but not the direct rays of the sun.The table stands between two\nwindows facing south and overlooking the garden.When the moment of\nhatching comes, those two windows will always remain open to give the\nswarm entire liberty to go in and out as it pleases.The glass tubes\nand reed-stumps are laid here and there, in fine disorder, close to the\nheaps of cocoons and all in a horizontal position, for the Osmia will\nhave nothing to do with upright reeds.Although such a precaution is\nnot indispensable, I take care to place some cocoons in each cylinder.The hatching of some of the Osmiae will therefore take place under\ncover of the galleries destined to be the building-yard later; and the\nsite will be all the more deeply impressed on their memory.When I have\nmade these comprehensive arrangements, there is nothing more to be\ndone; and I wait patiently for the building-season to open.My Osmiae leave their cocoons in the second half of April.Under the\nimmediate rays of the sun, in well-sheltered nooks, the hatching would\noccur a month earlier, as we can see from the mixed population of the\nsnowy almond-tree.The constant shade in my study has delayed the\nawakening, without, however, making any change in the nesting-period,\nwhich synchronizes with the flowering of the thyme.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.We now have, around\nmy working-table, my books, my jars and my various appliances, a\nbuzzing crowd that goes in and out of the windows at every moment.I\nenjoin the household henceforth not to touch a thing in the insects'\nlaboratory, to do no more sweeping, no more dusting.They might disturb\na swarm and make it think that my hospitality was not to be trusted.During four or five weeks I witness the work of a number of Osmiae\nwhich is much too large to allow my watching their individual\noperations.I content myself with a few, whom I mark with\ndifferent- spots to distinguish them; and I take no notice of\nthe others, whose finished work will have my attention later.If the sun is bright, they flutter\naround the heap of tubes as if to take careful note of the locality;\nblows are exchanged and the rival swains indulge in mild skirmishing on\nthe floor, then shake the dust off their wings.They fly assiduously\nfrom tube to tube, placing their heads in the orifices to see if some\nfemale will at last make up her mind to emerge.She is covered with dust and has the\ndisordered toilet that is inseparable from the hard work of the\ndeliverance.A lover has seen her, so has a second, likewise a third.The lady responds to their advances by clashing\nher mandibles, which open and shut rapidly, several times in\nsuccession.The suitors forthwith fall back; and they also, no doubt to\nkeep up their dignity, execute savage mandibular grimaces.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.Then the\nbeauty retires into the arbour and her wooers resume their places on\nthe threshold.A fresh appearance of the female, who repeats the play\nwith her jaws; a fresh retreat of the males, who do the best they can\nto flourish their own pincers.The Osmiae have a strange way of\ndeclaring their passion: with that fearsome gnashing of their\nmandibles, the lovers look as though they meant to devour each other.It suggests the thumps affected by our yokels in their moments of\ngallantry.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.The females, who grow more numerous\nfrom day to day, inspect the premises; they buzz outside the glass\ngalleries and the reed dwellings; they go in, stay for a while, come\nout, go in again and then fly away briskly into the garden.They\nreturn, first one, then another.They halt outside, in the sun, or on\nthe shutters fastened back against the wall; they hover in the\nwindow-recess, come inside, go to the reeds and give a glance at them,\nonly to set off again and to return soon after.Thus do they learn to\nknow their home, thus do they fix their birthplace in their memory.The\nvillage of our childhood is always a cherished spot, never to be\neffaced from our recollection.The Osmia's life endures for a month;\nand she acquires a lasting remembrance of her hamlet in a couple of\ndays.'Twas there that she was born;

but the nobility so granted belonged to\none only of the family at the time, to the actual owner of the peerage.All ranks could at all times freely intermarry; all offices were open\nto all freemen; and England, unlike Germany, never saw ecclesiastical\nfoundations whose members were bound to be of noble birth.The position of the Estate of the Clergy was also widely different in\nEngland from what it was in other countries.In fact the political\nposition of the Clergy has, ever since Edward the First, been something\nutterly anomalous and inconsistent.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.Elsewhere the representatives of\nthe Clergy, just like those of the Nobles, formed one distinct Estate\nin the Assembly.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.In England the great Prelates had seats in the House\nof Lords, where the Bishops keep them still.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>John took the milk there.But there also existed\nthe anomalous body called Convocation, whose character has always\nfluctuated between that of an ecclesiastical Synod and that of a\nparliamentary Estate of the realm(49).The Clergy are still summoned\nalong with every Parliament; and one distinctly parliamentary function\nthey held down to the reign of Charles the Second, which was then\ntaken away without any formal enactment.It was one of our great\nconstitutional principles established in King Edward\u2019s days that no tax\ncould be granted to the King except by those who had to pay it.But for\na long time the Lords and the Commons taxed themselves separately, and\nthe Clergy in their Convocation taxed themselves separately also.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.And,\ntill this power was given up, an ecclesiastical benefice gave no right\nto vote in the election of members of the House of Commons(50).The Commons too themselves bear a name which had a far different\nmeaning in England from what it bore elsewhere.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.The usage by which\nthe Knights of the shire and the Citizens and Burgesses were brought\ntogether in a single House, whatever was its origin, whether it were\nat first the result of design or of happy accident, has been an\nusage no less wholesome, no less needful to our full constitutional\ndevelopement, than that which decreed that the children of peers\nshould be commoners.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.In most other countries the class of men who\nwere returned as representatives of the counties, the Knights of\nthe Shire, would have been members of the Estate of the Nobles.In\nFrance the words _nobleman_ and _gentleman_ had the same meaning,\nthat of the members of an exclusive aristocratic caste.The Commons,\nthe Third Estate, consisted of the citizens of the privileged towns\nonly(51).But in England the middle class was not confined to the\ntowns; it spread itself, in the form of a lesser gentry and a wealthy\nyeomanry, over the whole face of the land.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.That class, the smaller\nlandowners, was for a long time the strength of the country, and the\nhappiest results came from the union of their representatives in a\nsingle chamber with those of the cities and boroughs.Each class gained\nstrength from its fellowship with the other, and the citizen class\ngained, from their union on equal terms with the landed gentry, a\nconsideration which otherwise they might never have reached.In short,\nthe union of the two, the union of all classes of freemen except the\nclergy and the actual members of the peerage, of all classes from the\npeer\u2019s eldest son to the smallest freeholder or burgess, made the House\nof Commons a real representation of the whole nation, and not of any\nsingle order in the nation.Mark again that the form of government which political writers call\n_bi-cameral_, that is to say, where the Legislative Assembly consists\nof two Chambers or Houses, arose out of one of the accidents of English\nHistory.The merits of that form of government are now freely under\ndiscussion, but it is assumed on both sides that the only choice\nlies between one chamber and two; no one proposes to have three or\nfour(52).<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.But most of the continental bodies of Estates consisted,\nas we have seen, of three Houses; in Sweden, where the peasants, the\nsmall freeholders, were important enough to be separately represented\nalongside of the Nobles, Clergy, and Citizens, there were till lately\nfour(53).The number two became the number of our Houses of Parliament,\nnot out of any conviction of the advantages of that number, but because\nit was found impossible to get the Clergy in England habitually to\nact, as they did elsewhere, as a regular member of the parliamentary\nbody.They shrank from the burthen, or they deemed secular legislation\ninconsistent with their profession.Thus, instead of the Clergy\nforming, as they did in France, a distinct Estate of the Legislature,\nwe got a Parliament of two Houses, Lords and Commons, attended by a\nkind of ecclesiastical shadow of the Parliament in the shape of the\ntwo Houses of the ecclesiastical Convocation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Thus, for all practical\npurposes, there were only two Estates in the English Parliament, Lords\nand Commons.Thus the phrase of the Three Estates, which had a meaning\nin France, became meaningless in England.For centuries back there has\nbeen no separate Estate of the Clergy; some of their highest members\nhave belonged to the Estate of the Lords, and the rest to the Estate of\nthe Commons.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.Hence has arisen a common but not unnatural misconception,\na misconception as old as the days of the Long Parliament, as to the\nmeaning of the phrase of the Three Estates.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.Men constantly use those\nwords as if they meant the three elements among which the legislative\npower is divided, King, Lords, and Commons.But an Estate means a rank\nor order or class of men, like the Lords, the Clergy, or the Commons.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.The King is not an Estate, because there is no class or order of\nKings, the King being one person alone by himself.The proper phrase\nis the King and the three Estates of the Realm.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.But in England, as I\nhave already shown, the phrase is meaningless, as we have in truth two\nEstates only(54).We thus had in England, not an Estate of Nobles, forming a distinct\nclass from the people, but an Upper House of hereditary and official\nLords, whose privileges were purely personal, and whose children had\nno political privilege above other men.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.Our Bishops and some other of<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.", "question": "Where is the milk?

then the Lords came gradually to follow the lead of the\nCommons; but open and violent breaches between the Houses have been\nrare indeed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.From the days of Earl Simon onwards, both the power of\nParliament as a whole, and the special power of the House of Commons,\nwas constantly growing.The Parliaments of the fourteenth century\nexercised all the powers which our Parliament exercises now, together\nwith some which modern Parliaments shrink from exercising.That is to\nsay, the Parliaments of those days were obliged either to do directly\nor to leave undone many things which the developement of political\nconventionality enables a modern Parliament to do indirectly.The\nancient Parliaments demanded the dismissal of the King\u2019s ministers;\nthey regulated his personal household; they put his authority into\ncommission; if need called for such a step, they put forth their last\nand greatest power and deposed him from his kingly office.In those\ndays a change of government, a change of policy, the getting rid of\na bad minister and the putting a better in his place, were things\nwhich never could be done without an open struggle between King and\nParliament; often they could not be done without the bondage, the\nimprisonment, or the death, perhaps only of the minister, perhaps even\nof the King himself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.The same ends can now be gained by a vote of\ncensure in the House of Commons; in many cases they can be gained even\nwithout a vote of censure, by the simple throwing out of a measure by\nwhich a Ministry has given out that it will stand or fall(56).<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.The fifteenth century, as compared with the thirteenth and fourteenth,\nwas in some respects a time in which things went back.It is plain\nthat the Parliaments of that day were bodies which were much less\nindependent than the Parliaments of earlier times.During the Wars of\nthe Roses each successive military victor found a Parliament ready to\nconfirm his claim to the Crown and to decree the condemnation of his\nenemies(57).And it was a Parliament of Henry the Sixth which passed\nthe most reactionary measure which any Parliament ever did pass,\nthat by which the qualification for a county elector was narrowed to\nthose freeholders whose estates were of the yearly value of forty\nshillings(58).In this case time and the change in the value of money\nhave redressed the wrong; there may be freeholders whose estates are\nunder the value of forty shillings, but I cannot think that they are\nnow a very large or important class.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.But, to understand the meaning of\nthe restriction in the fifteenth century, for forty shillings we may\nfairly read forty pounds; and certainly, if we struck off the register\nall those electors whose qualification is a freehold\u2014much more those\nwhose qualification is an estate less than a freehold\u2014under the value\nof forty pounds, the lessening of the constituencies of our counties\nwould not be small.On the other hand, during the revolutionary times\nwhich followed, we more than once hear of direct appeals to the people\nwhich remind us of days far earlier.Edward the Fourth and Richard the\nThird were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown\nacknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us\nof the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59).Still even in this age, the\npower of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender\nto get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the\ngrowing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which\nshow that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a\nshire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for\nmen of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even\nfor the sons of members of the Upper House(61).<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary\ninstitutions in so many countries of Europe.Not a few assemblies which\nhad once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,\neither utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities.Then it\nwas that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free\nconstitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General\nof France met for the last time before their last meeting of all\non the eve of the great Revolution(62).In England parliamentary\ninstitutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty\nform.But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,\nbecame perverted into instruments of tyranny.Under Henry the Eighth,\nParliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed\nwhatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot.Why had they so\nfallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they\nwere to be again?The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained\nstrength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to\nbe an independent body.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.The old nobility had been cut off at Towton\nand Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King\nto whom they owed their honours.A century later, the new nobility\nhad inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the\nfulness of their power.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments\nof the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant\u2019s will, of\nwhich we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the fourteenth or\nof the seventeenth.Very different indeed from the Parliaments which\noverthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments\nwhich, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against\nany man against whom Henry\u2019s caprice had turned, the Parliaments\nwhich, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready\nto enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which\nfor the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his\nson or to his daughters.Why, it may be asked, in such a state of\nthings, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they\nperished in so many other lands?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.It might be enough to say that no\nruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that", "question": "Where is the milk?

then his\nbetter nature conquered, and extending his hand, he said: \"There, Fred;\nI didn't mean to hurt your feelings, much less reflect on the memory of\nyour mother.From the North though she was, she was one of the best of\nwomen, and you know I loved her almost as much as you did yourself, for\nin many ways she was a mother to me.Fred grasped the extended hand, and with tears in his eyes exclaimed, \"I\nmight have known you did not mean it, Cal.You are too noble to say\naught of one who loved you as my mother did.\"There is nothing to forgive, Fred; you did just right.\"For a moment the boys remained silent, and then Fred resumed: \"Cal, we\nmust both try to be charitable.Simply to be for the North or the South\ndoes not make one a gentleman.True manhood is not measured by one's\npolitical belief.Your father is none the less a gentleman because he is\nheart and soul with the South.Calhoun, dark and fearful days are\ncoming--have already come.Father will be against son, brother against\nbrother.Members of the same family will become the deadliest enemies.Our beloved Kentucky will be rent and torn with warring factions, and\nthe whole land will tremble beneath the shock of contending armies.Ruined homes will be everywhere;

even unto death would they be true to each other.Little did either think what would be the outcome of that strange\ncompact.Little did they realize that the day would come when that oath,\nif kept, would lead both into the very jaws of death--an ignoble and\nterrible death.That oath, under the spreading oak, on that July evening\nbetween two boys, was to become the pivot around which the fate of\ncontending armies depended.Calhoun was the first to speak after the making of the solemn compact.\"Fred,\" he exclaimed, \"now that we have sworn eternal friendship, it\nwill not do for us to quarrel any more.Like the man and his wife they\ntell about, 'we agree to disagree.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.They must be disgusted with our loitering.See that\ntree yonder, nearly a mile away, where the Danville and Nicholasville\nroads cross?I can beat you to that tree, and if I do, the South wins.\"\"Done,\" cried Fred, for he had all the love of a true Kentucky boy for a\nhorse race.\"Now, Prince,\" said he, as he unhitched his horse, and\npatted his glossy neck, \"you hear.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Win,\nor never hold up your head again.\"\"Selim,\" cried Calhoun, \"how do you like that?It is the cause of the\nSunny South that is at stake.Win, Selim, or I will sell you to the\nmeanest Abolitionist in the North.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Both boys vaulted into their saddles, and at the word their steeds were\naway like the wind.Never was there a hotter race run in Kentucky.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.Neck and neck the horses\nran, neither seemingly able to gain an inch on the other.Each rider bent over the neck of his flying steed, and\nurged him on with word and spur.\"Now, Prince, if ever,\" cried Fred.With a tremendous effort, he plunged forward, and passed the\ngoal half a length ahead.[Illustration: He plunged forward, and passed the Goal half-a-length\nahead.]cried Fred, but his huzzah died on his lips.The excitement of\nthe race had made the boys careless, and they ran into a squad of\nhorsemen who were passing along the other road.Fred came nearly\nunhorsing the leader of the squad, a heavy-set, red-faced man with bushy\nhair that stood up all around his large head.He was dressed in the\nuniform of an officer of the United States", "question": "Where is the apple?

then mechanically he\nreached for the pistol in his holster.With a sharp exclamation, Fred\nspurred his horse between the angry man and Calhoun, and striking down\nNelson's arm, cried: \"How dare you!Then\nturning to Calhoun, he gave the sharp command, \"Go!Calhoun obeyed, and boy and horse were off like a shot;

he began to chuckle, and then to laugh.Turning to one of his staff, he exclaimed: \"Gad!Lieutenant, I came\nnearly forgetting myself and shooting that boy.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.It would have been an\noutrage.He has the grit, the true Kentucky grit.I am proud of both of\nthose boys.Such was General William Nelson, fiery, erratic, and oftentimes cruel,\nbut at all times ready to acknowledge true courage and manliness in his\nworst enemy.To him, more than to any other one man, does the government\nowe the fact that Kentucky was saved to the Union.In the face of the\nfiercest opposition he never faltered in his purpose of raising troops,\nand the most direful threats only nerved him to greater exertion.If impatience get the better of us, we\ncan open them at the end of July or in August.The insect is then in\nthe nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the\ntwo sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,\nand by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future\narmour of the females.Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow\nfront cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to\nmales; the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at\nthe back, all belong to females.The conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia\nconsists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a\ngroup of males.With my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and\nwith old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the\nHorned Osmia in fair quantities.I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to build\nher nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from\nexpecting.All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps\nhorizontally within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her\nusual haunts, namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.Lastly,\nI succeeded without difficulty in making her build her nests in the\nprivacy of my study, with glass tubes for a house.With both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as with\nthe Three-horned Osmia.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.At the back are large cells with plentiful\nprovisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with\nscanty provisions and partitions close together.Also, the larger cells\nsupplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me\nlittle cocoons and males.The conclusion therefore is exactly the same\nin the case of all three Osmiae.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.These conclusions, as my notes show, apply likewise, in every respect,\nto the various species of Mason-bees; and one clear and simple rule\nstands out from this collection of facts.Apart from the strange\nexception of the Three-pronged Osmia, who mixes the sexes without any\norder, the Bees whom I studied and probably a crowd of others produce\nfirst a continuous series of females and then a continuous series of\nmales, the latter with less provisions and smaller cells.This\ndistribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long known of the\nHive-bee, who begins her laying with a long", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the apple there.The analogy\ncontinues down to the capacity of the cells and the quantities of\nprovisions.The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax cells\nincomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive a\nmuch larger amount of food.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Everything therefore demonstrates that we\nare here in the presence of a general rule.OPTIONAL DETERMINATION OF THE SEXES.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Is there nothing beyond a\nlaying in two series?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of\nthem fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct\ngroups, the male group following upon the female group, without any\nmixing of the two?Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change\nin this arrangement, should circumstances require it?The Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from\nbeing solved.In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very\nirregularly, as though at random.Why this mixture in the series of\ncocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the\nThree-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes in\nthe hollow of a reed?What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her\nkinswomen of the reeds do too?Nothing, so far as I know, explains this\nfundamental difference in a physiological act of primary importance.The three Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in\ngeneral outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close\nsimilarity, we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.There is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the\ncause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying.If I\nopen a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find\nit impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively\nbetween a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so small.The cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the\ncylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always\nthe same distance apart.If I open it in July, the victualling-period,\nit is impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined\nfor the males and those destined for the females.The measurement of\nthe column of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.We find an equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.This result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes\nin the adult form tells us.The male does not differ materially from\nthe female in respect of size.If he is a trifle smaller, it is\nscarcely noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned\nOsmia, the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we\nhave seen from the respective bulk of their cocoons.In the Mason-bee\nof the Walls there is also a difference in size, though less\npronounced.The Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting\nthe dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex\nof the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one\nend of the series to the other.It does not matter if the sexes\nalternate without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever\ntheir position in the row.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.The two other Osmiae, with their great\ndisparity in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the\ntwofold consideration of board and lodging.The more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it\nappeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and\nthe regular series of the other Osmiae and of the Bees in general were\nall traceable to a common law.It seemed to me that the arrangement in\na succession first of females and then of males did not account for\neverything.And I was right: that\narrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the reality, which is\nremarkable in a very different way.This is what I am going to prove by\nexperiment.The succession first of females and then of males is not, in fact,\ninvariable.Thus, the Chalicodoma, whose nests serve for two or three\ngenerations, ALWAYS lays male eggs in the old male cells, which can be\nrecognized by their lesser capacity, and female eggs in the old female\ncells of more spacious dimensions.This presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two\ncells free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest\nfashion that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of\nrecent production is here replaced by an irregular distribution,\nharmonizing with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be\nstocked.The Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant\ncells: two larger and three smaller.The total space at her disposal\nwould do for about a third of the laying.Well, in the two large cells,\nshe puts females; in the three small cells she puts males.As we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs\nadmit that the mother knows the sex of the eggs which she is going to\nlay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity.We\ncan go further, and admit that the mother alters the order of\nsuccession of the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between\none old nest and another, are broken up into small groups of males and\nfemales according to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which\nshe happens to be occupying.Here then is the Chalicodoma, when mistress of an old nest of which she\nhas not the power to alter the arrangement, breaking up her laying into\nsections comprising both sexes just as required by the conditions\nimposed upon her.She therefore decides the sex of the egg at will,\nfor, without this prerogative, she could not, in the chambers of the\nnest which she owes to chance, deposit unerringly the sex for which\nthose chambers were originally built; and this happens however small\nthe number of chambers to be filled.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.When the mother herself founds the dwelling, when she lays the first\nrows of bricks, the females come first and the males at the finish.But, when she is in the presence of an old nest, of which she is quite\nunable to alter the general arrangement, how is she to make use of a\nfew vacant rooms, the large and small alike, if the sex of the egg be\nalready irrevocably fixed?She can only do so by abandoning the\narrangement in two consecutive rows and accommodating her laying to the\nvaried exigencies of the home.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.Either she finds it impossible to make\nan economical use of the old nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or\nelse she determines at will the sex of the egg which she is about to\nlay.The Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the\nlatter point.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk.We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners,\nwho themselves dig out the foundation of their cells.They make use of\nthe old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as\nhollow stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in\nwalls, clay or wood.Their work is confined to repairs to the house,\nsuch", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "There are plenty of these retreats; and\nthe insects would always find first-class ones if it thought of going\nany distance to look for them.But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she\nreturns to her birthplace and clings to it with a patience extremely\ndifficult to exhaust.It is here, in this little familiar corner, that\nshe prefers to settle her progeny.But then the apartments are few in\nnumber and of all shapes and sizes.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.There are long and short ones,\nspacious ones and narrow.Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan\ncourse, she has to use them all, from first to last, for she has no\nchoice.Guided by these considerations, I embarked on the experiments\nwhich I will now describe.I have said how my study became a populous hive, in which the\nThree-horned Osmia built her nests in the various appliances which I\nhad prepared for her.Among these appliances, tubes, either of glass or\nreed, predominated.In the\nlong tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a series of females\nfollowed by a series of males, were deposited.As I have already\nreferred to this result, I will not discuss it again.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.The short tubes\nwere sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other portion of the\ntotal laying.Basing my calculations on the respective lengths of the\ncocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the partitions and the\nfinal lid, I shortened some of these to the exact dimensions required\nfor two cocoons only, of different sexes.Well, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as\neagerly as the long tubes.Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:\ntheir contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with\nfemale and ended with male cocoons.This order was invariable; what\nvaried was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion\nbetween the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and\nsometimes females.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.When confronted with tubes too small to receive all her family, the\nOsmia is in the same plight as the Mason-bee in the presence of an old\nnest.She thereupon acts exactly as the Chalicodoma does.She breaks up\nher laying, divides it into series as short as the room at her disposal\ndemands; and each series begins with females and ends with males.This\nbreaking up, on the one hand, into sections in all of which both sexes\nare represented and the division, on the other hand, of the entire\nlaying into just two groups, one female, the other male, when the\nlength of the tube permits, surely provide us with ample evidence of\nthe insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg according to the\nexigencies of space.And besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add\nthose connected with the earlier development of the males.These burst\ntheir cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are\nthe first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree.In order to\nrelease themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing\nthe string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they\nmust occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason\nthat makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males.Being\nnext to the door, these impatient ones will leave the home without\nupsetting the shells that are slower in hatching.I had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old nests\nof the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with\ncylindrical cavities in them.These cavities are formed, as in the old\nnests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called\nand of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer\ncoating at the time of its deliverance.The diameter is about 7\nmillimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre\nof the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.)<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.and at\nthe edge averages 14 millimetres.The deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes\neven the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female\noccupying the lower and the male the upper storey.Lastly, the deeper\ncavities on the circumference are allotted to females and the shallower\nto males.We know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of\nthe Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the\nSheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora, in whose nests I have noted\nsimilar facts.The choice rests with the mother,\nwho is guided by considerations of space and, according to the\naccommodation at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and\nincapable of modification, places a female in this cell and a male in\nthat, so that both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their\nunequal development.This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous\nand varied facts which I have set forth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the milk.People unfamiliar with insect\nanatomy--the public for whom I write--would probably give the following\nexplanation of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has\nat her disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably\nfemale and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of\neither group the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her\nchoice is decided by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be\nstocked.Everything would then be limited to a judicious selection from\nthe heap of eggs.Should this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.Nothing could be more false, as the most casual reference to anatomy\nwill show.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera\nconsists generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers,\ndivided into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the\noviduct, which carries the eggs outside.Each of these glove-fingers is\nfairly wide at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is\nclosed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the milk.It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads\non a string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of\nwhich the lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones\nhalfway towards maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.Every\nstage of evolution is here represented, distributed regularly from\nbottom to top, from the verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the\nembryo.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.The sheath clasps its string of ovules so closely that any\ninversion of the order is impossible.Besides, an inversion would\nresult in a gross absurdity: the replacing of a riper egg by another in\nan earlier stage of development.It had been long since he had suffered a\ndefeat--too long.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.During this period Jennie received her earliest lesson in the\nvagaries of men.For two weeks she did not even see him, and one\nevening, after an extremely comfortless conference with his leader, he\nmet her with the most chilling formality.When she knocked at his door\nhe only troubled to open it a foot, exclaiming almost harshly: \"I\ncan't bother about the clothes to-night.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.Jennie retreated, shocked", "question": "Where is the milk?

but these boys had been taught\nby pious parents to speak the truth always, whatever came of it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.that is the right principle to go on, dear children; TELL THE TRUTH when\nyou have done anything wrong, even if you are sure of being punished\nwhen that truth is known.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.So George, as the eldest, with one brave look at his comrades, frankly\nrelated everything that had happened; beginning at the quarrel with\nTom, down to the escape from the bull.To describe the varied expression\nof his auditor's face between delight and vexation, would require a\npainter; and when George at last said, \"Do you think we deserve to be\npunished, sir?or have we paid well enough already for our court\nmartial?\"Schermerhorn exclaimed, trying to appear highly incensed,\nyet scarcely able to help smiling:\n\n\"I declare I hardly know!How\ndare you treat a young gentleman so on my place?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.answer me that, you\nscapegraces!It is pretty plain who is at the bottom of all this--Peter\ndares not look at me, I perceive.At the same time, I am rather glad\nthat Master Tom has been taught what to expect if he runs down the\nUnion--it will probably save him from turning traitor any more, though\nyou were not the proper persons to pass sentence on him.As for our\nplucky little Colonel here--shake hands, Freddy!and for your sake I excuse the court martial.Now, let us see what\nhas become of the bull, and then go to the release of our friend Tom.He\nmust be thoroughly repentant for his misdeeds by this time.\"Schermerhorn accordingly gave orders that the bull should be hunted\nup and secured, until his master should be discovered; so that the\nZouaves might be safe from his attacks hereafter.If any of our readers\nfeel an interest in the fate of this charming animal, they are informed\nthat he was, with great difficulty, hunted into the stables; and before\nevening taken away by his master, the farmer from whom he had strayed.Leaving the others to await his capture, let us return to Tom.He had\nnot been ten minutes in the smoke house before his wrath began to cool,\nand he would have given sixpence for any way of getting out but by\nbegging pardon.That was a little too much just yet, and Tom stamped\nwith rage and shook the door; which resisted his utmost efforts to\nburst.Then came the sounds without, the rushing, trampling steps, the\nfurious bellow, and the shout, \"Run!and especially what would become of\nhim left alone there, with this unseen enemy perhaps coming at him next.He hunted in vain in every direction for some cranny to peep through;\nand if it had been possible, would have squeezed his head up the\nchimney.He shouted for help, but nobody heard him;

sniffling\ndesperately, and rubbing his nose violently up in the air--a proceeding\nwhich did not ameliorate its natural bent in that direction.He really\nfelt thoroughly sorry, and quite ready to beg pardon as soon as the boys\nshould return; particularly as they had forgotten to provide the captive\nwith even the traditional bread and water, and dinner-time was close at\nhand.While he was yet struggling between repentance and stomachache,\nthe welcome sound of their voices was heard.They came nearer, and then\na key was hastily applied to the fastenings of the door, and it flew\nopen, disclosing the Zouaves, with Freddy at the head, and Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.Tom hung back a moment yet;

perfectly crammed with Indians and scalps and awful\nbattles and elegant Mexican palaces full of diamonds and gold saucepans\nand lovely Spanish girls carried off by the hair of their heads!\"This flourishing rigmarole, which Harry delivered regardless of stops,\nmade the boys shout with laughter.\"You'd better tell the story yourself, since you know so much about\nit!\"\"I allow you've never been in Mexico, sir,\" said Jerry, grinning.\"I\ndoubt but thar's palisses somewhar in Mexico, but I and my mates hev\nbeen thar, an' _we_ never seed none o' 'em.No, Master Harry, I can't\ntell ye sich stories as that, but I do mind a thing what happened on the\nfield afore Monterey.\"The boys, delightedly exclaiming, \"A story!drew their\ncamp stools around him;

but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful\nand energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary\ncorrespondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave\nis present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel\ntools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended\nhere must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and\nPalecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the\nSupreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should\nbe purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large\ndemand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking\nthat the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of\nthan that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no\nmore than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was\nby no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable\nwood had to be used.We also had to obtain laths from private persons\nat Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore\nspecially request that during the next northern monsoon the following\nare sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary\nbuilding operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in\ntwo kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,\nthree out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that\nthis timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the\nsupervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to\nany inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such\na person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,\nand the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under\nthe heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound\nto deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as\na substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were\nsent last January as promised to Your Honour.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience\nthan of importance.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the apple there.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting\nthis duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the\nother hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well\nif it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers\nwould not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,\nas that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of\ncost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000\nparas from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in\npayment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that\nany amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed\nby Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.But as\nanother order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel\nfor 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way\nthat I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would\nadd some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my\ndoing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of\nforeign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,\nmust be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth\n(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20\nper cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term\nat the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated\nin the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are\nprospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in\nfuture, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been\ngiven here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further\ncomments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders\nat the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.Zwaardecroon\nreduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed\nto the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders\nfrom the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution\nof 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;\nbecause, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to\n14,118.11.8 guilders.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.The account at present is as follows:--\n\n\n                                                     Guilders.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.[74]\n    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8\n    The Province of Patch", "question": "Where is the apple?

especially if the people should\nget into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash\nissued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from\nBatavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,\nthat Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of\nby Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,\nbut I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,\nand inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Meantime,\nYour Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not\nact prejudicially to the Company.At present their debt is 2,448.13\nguilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,\nand no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be\nemployed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.I do not think they\nneed be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their\nbeing discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the\nnatives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which\nwould be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so\nmany other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his\nlarge number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also\nopenly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid\nthe vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of\nChristianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference\nwhether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of\nJaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,\nfor whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously\nenlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their\ninstruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6\nguilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the\ninstructions.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11\nelephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced\nto him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.150 from\nthe Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but\nthat the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,\nbut with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of\nthe Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the\nThombo-keeper, Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already\nemployed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is\nbest to make as few changes as possible.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.The instructions with regard\nto the passports must be followed pending further orders.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the\nCourt of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins\nof Government, and that was only recently.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.I have besides no sufficient\nknowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse\nthe documents referred to.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,\nbut in case Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time\n(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation\nof the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the\nsurveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,\nbut every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In\ncase of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas\nIsaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties\nthere, Lieut.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the\nPolitical Council, could be appointed for the time;

beneath.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.The lobster, with his ready claw;\n    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;\n    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,\n    Averse to every social

Against all reason still to dash\n    In danger's way, and never think\n    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those\n    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still\n    The whale was settling down until\n    His back looked like an island small\n    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed\n    To sport again o'er dewy mead,\n    The spouting whale, with movement strong,\n    Ran crashing through some timbers long\n    That lumbermen had strongly tied\n    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,\n    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.The diving whale gave

displayed.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the\nsale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by\nPope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar\nlanguage, \"the Anointing of the Sick\".It is called by Origen \"the\ncomplement of Penance\".<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them\npray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the\nprayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;\nand if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Here the Bible states that the \"Prayer of Faith\" with Unction is more\neffective than the \"Prayer of Faith\" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the\nsoul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it\nalso, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and\nthen, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it\ncleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and\nindirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to\nheal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted\nin Apostolic days, when the Apostles \"anointed with oil many that were\nsick and healed them\" (St.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to

and,\nlast of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is\nwritten: \"All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner\nof anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible\nsign of an invisible grace\".<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple.[3]\n\n{161}\n\n_Its Administration._\n\nIt must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in\nSt.The first condition refers to:--\n\n(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate\ncapacity.Scripture says to the sick: \"Let him call for the Elders,\"\nor Presbyters, \"of the Church\".The word is in the plural; it is to be\nthe united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be\nnothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to\nbe ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private\nhouse, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  \"Let him call for\nthe elders.\"(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their\nown name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),\nbut \"in the Name of the Lord\".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the\nafflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: \"Let them pray over\nhim\".{162}\n\n(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--\"anointing him with oil\".As in Baptism,\nsanctified water is the ordained matter by which \"Jesus Christ\ncleanseth us from all sin\"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the\nordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all\nsickness--bodily, and (adds St.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football.\"And if he have\ncommitted sins, they shall be forgiven him.\"For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:\n_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: \"Confess your faults\none to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed\".Thus\nit is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the \"last\" as with\nthe first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says\nthat, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect\nmore than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,\nand prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing\nguaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and\nin addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized.\"The\nPrayer of Faith\" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more\nin proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being\nmore and more used \"according to the Scriptures\".Both are being used\ntogether in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that\n\"the elders of the Church\" are sent for by the sick; a simple service\nis used; the sick man is anointed; the united \"Prayer of Faith\" (it\n_must_ be \"of Faith\") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual\nhealth, the sick man is \"made whole of whatsoever disease he had\".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,\nmore loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is\nstill to be had.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen._If our love were but more simple,_\n    _We should take Him at His word;_\n  _And our lives would be all sunshine_\n    _In the sweetness of our Lord._\n\n\n\n[1] Article XXV.[2] \"Forbes on the Articles\" (xxv.).[3] \"Institution of a Christian Man.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.[4] In the Greek Church, seven, or at least three, Priests must be\npresent.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Anointing, 104, 158.Augustine, St., 3, 12, 13, 49.B.\n\n  Baptism, Sacrament of, 63.Bible, the, names of, 26.Books, the Church's, 21\n  Breviary, 44.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.Church, the, names of--\n    Catholic, 2.Primitive, 17,\n    Protestant, 18.Consecration, 83, 91.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.D.\n\n  Deacons, ordination of, 139.F.\n\n  Faith and Prayer with oil, 162.G.\n\n  God-parents, 65.I.\n\n  Illingworth, Dr., 61.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.K.\n\n  Kings and Bishops, 126, 128.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.L.\n\n  Laity responsible for ordination of deacons, 140.M.\n\n  Manual, the, 44.Manuscripts of the Bible, 26.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.A Sacrament, 107, 110.Who for, 107, 113, 116.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.N.\n\n  Name, Christian, 73.Nonconformists and Holy Communion, 99.O.\n\n  Oil, Holy, 159.Perpetuation, Sacraments of, 93.R.\n\n  Reconciliation, ministry of, 145.Recovery, Sacrament of, 93, 145.S.\n\n  Sacraments, 58.Sacrifice, 82, 87.Spiritualities and Temporalities, 128.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.Stubbs, Bishop, 8, 10.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.Supper, the Lord's, 82.T.\n\n  Table, the Holy, 88.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.Transubstantiation, 83, 84.U.\n\n  Unction, Extreme, 160.W.\n\n  Word of God, 31.\"Yes, it's true for those who are like you and your mother.\"She leaned against him, and looked over his shoulder at the pictures.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.Alvord, mamma said the song was for you, too.What else did He come for but to help people who are in trouble?I\nread stories about Him<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.", "question": "Where is the football?

though it was a\npoor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This\nis his photograph,\u201d rummaging his pocket-book--\u201cno, not that one, old\nlady,\u201d a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.\u201cMayn\u2019t I see it, Jack?\u201d she\npetitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish;

but she bids me say that\nif you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than\npleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,\nthat she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,\nand discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son\u2019s\nheart so completely by storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and, Jack,\u201d cries Ruby, \u201cI\u2019ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,\nseeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can\u2019t\nI bring her to Greenock when I come?<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Because, seeing she is called\nafter you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Oughtn\u2019t\nshe?\u201d questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May\u2019s donor with very\nwide brown eyes.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.\u201cIt would never do to leave May\nbehind in Edinburgh.\u201d He lingers over the name almost lovingly;

through the\nquaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the\nbusy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which\nencircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully\nlonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw\nhave come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in\ndiscoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.\u201cI know it by the tombstone,\u201d observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close\nthe gates behind them.\u201cIt\u2019s a grey tombstone, and mamma\u2019s name below\na lot of others.This is it, I think,\u201d adds the child, pausing before\na rather desolate-looking grey slab.\u201cYes, there\u2019s her name at the\nfoot, \u2018Janet Stuart,\u2019 and dad says that was her favourite text that\u2019s\nunderneath--\u2018Surely I come quickly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.Even so come, Lord Jesus.\u2019\nI\u2019ll put down the flowers.I wonder,\u201d says Ruby, looking up into Jack\u2019s\nface with a sudden glad wonder on her own, \u201cif mamma can look down from\nheaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody\u2019s putting\nflowers on her grave at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,\u201d\nJack Kirke says very gently.\u201cBut she will be glad, I am sure, if she\nsees us--and I think she does,\u201d the young man adds reverently--\u201cthat\nthrough all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember her,\u201d says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.\u201cOnly dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me\nthat she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord\nJesus that I might be one of His jewels.I\u2019m not!\u201d cries\nRuby, with a little choke in her voice.\u201cAnd if I\u2019m not, the Lord Jesus\nwill never gather me, and I\u2019ll never see my mamma again.Even up in\nheaven she might p\u2019raps feel sorry if some day I wasn\u2019t there too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl\u2019s\nshoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who\nis wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed\nway, wondered too, if even \u2019midst heaven\u2019s glories another will \u201cfeel\nsorry\u201d because those left behind will not one far day join them there.\u201cI felt that too,\u201d the young man goes on quietly.\u201cBut it\u2019s all right\nnow, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,\nand I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be\nwas no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the\nmists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very\nbest possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn\u2019t understand\njust yet why.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite\nsure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn\u2019t rest till\nI made sure of that.It\u2019s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the\ndear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I\nwondered how I could have doubted so long.I can\u2019t speak about such\nthings,\u201d the young fellow adds huskily, \u201cbut I felt that if you feel\nabout your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don\u2019t you\nsee, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able\nto save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat\u2019s sake that I tried to\nlove Him first; but now I love Him for His own.\u201d\n\nIt has cost Ruby\u2019s friend more than the child knows to make even this\nsimple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven\u2019s morning\nJack\u2019s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a\ndoubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter\u2019s day.For it is\nsaid that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for\nthe dear Christ\u2019s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.\u201cI love you, Jack,\u201d is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend\u2019s\nhand.\u201cAnd if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I\u2019ll tell her how\ngood you\u2019ve been to me.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Jack,

young fellow\u2019s heart has\ngone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the\nbrother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart\nfeels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother\nJack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;\nthat too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and\nnow!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into\nthe sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all\ntrouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad\u2019s heart cries out with a fierce\nyearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear\nold Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm\nhand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the\nsong of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but\nsweeter far in those fond ears will", "question": "Where

who now\nprayed that the cavaliers of merry Scotland, who were known over the\nwide world for bravery and courtesy, would permit a poor stranger to try\nwhether she could afford them any amusement by her art.The love of song\nwas like the love of fight, a common passion of the age, which all\nat least affected, whether they were actually possessed by it or no;\ntherefore the acquiescence in Louise's proposal was universal.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.At\nthe same time, an aged, dark browed monk who was among the bystanders\nthought it necessary to remind the glee maiden that, since she was\ntolerated within these precincts, which was an unusual grace, he trusted\nnothing would be sung or said inconsistent with the holy character of\nthe place.The glee maiden bent her head low, shook her sable locks, and crossed\nherself reverentially, as if she disclaimed the possibility of such a\ntransgression, and then began the song of \"Poor Louise.\"which we gave\nat length in the last chapter.Just as she commenced, she was stopped by a cry of \"Room--room--place\nfor the Duke of Rothsay!\"\"Nay, hurry no man on my score,\" said a gallant young cavalier, who\nentered on a noble Arabian horse, which he managed with exquisite grace,\nthough by such slight handling of the reins, such imperceptible pressure\nof the limbs and sway of the body, that to any eye save that of an\nexperienced horseman the animal seemed to be putting forth his paces for\nhis own amusement, and thus gracefully bearing forward a rider who was\ntoo indolent to give himself any trouble about the matter.The Prince's apparel, which was very rich, was put on with slovenly\ncarelessness.His form, though his stature was low, and his limbs\nextremely slight, was elegant in the extreme; and his features no less\nhandsome.But there was on his brow a haggard paleness, which seemed\nthe effect of care or of dissipation, or of both these wasting causes\ncombined.His eyes were sunk and dim, as from late indulgence in revelry\non the preceding evening, while his cheek was inflamed with unnatural\nred, as if either the effect of the Bacchanalian orgies had not passed\naway from the constitution, or a morning draught had been resorted to,\nin order to remove the effects of the night's debauchery.Such was the Duke of Rothsay, and heir of the Scottish crown, a sight\nat once of interest and compassion.All unbonneted and made way for him,\nwhile he kept repeating carelessly, \"No haste--no haste: I shall arrive\nsoon enough at the place I am bound for.How's this--a damsel of the\njoyous science?Stand\nstill, my merry men; never was minstrelsy marred for me.Louise did not know the person who addressed her; but the general\nrespect paid by all around, and the easy and indifferent manner in which\nit was received, showed her she was addressed by a man of the highest\nquality.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.She recommenced her lay, and sung her best accordingly; while\nthe young duke seemed thoughtful and rather affected towards the close\nof the ditty.But it was not his habit to cherish such melancholy\naffections.\"This is a plaintive ditty, my nut brown maid,\" said he, chucking the\nretreating glee maiden under the chin, and detaining her by the collar\nof her dress, which was not difficult, as he sat on horseback so close\nto the steps on which she stood.\"But I warrant me you have livelier\nnotes at will, ma bella tenebrosa; ay, and canst sing in bower as well\nas wold, and by night as well as day.\"\"I am no nightingale, my lord,\" said Louise, endeavouring to escape a\nspecies of gallantry which ill suited the place and circumstances--a\ndiscrepancy to which he who addressed it to her seemed contemptuously\nindifferent.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.he added, removing his hold from her\ncollar to the scrip which she carried.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.Glad was Louise to escape his grasp, by slipping the knot of the riband,\nand leaving the little bag in the Prince's hand, as, retiring back\nbeyond his reach, she answered, \"Nuts, my lord, of the last season.\"The Prince pulled out a handful of nuts accordingly.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.they\nwill break thine ivory teeth, hurt thy pretty voice,\" said Rothsay,\ncracking one with his teeth, like a village schoolboy.\"They are not the walnuts of my own sunny clime, my lord,\" said Louise;\n\"but they hang low, and are within the reach of the poor.\"<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.\"You shall have something to afford you better fare, poor wandering\nape,\" said the Duke, in a tone in which feeling predominated more than\nin the affected and contemptuous gallantry of his first address to the\nglee maiden.At this moment, as he turned to ask an attendant for his purse, the\nPrince encountered the stern and piercing look of a tall black man,\nseated on a powerful iron grey horse, who had entered the court with\nattendants while the Duke of Rothsay was engaged with Louise, and now\nremained stupefied and almost turned to stone by his surprise and anger\nat this unseemly spectacle.Even one who had never seen Archibald\nEarl of Douglas,", "question": "Where is the milk?

and the bystanders waited the issue with silence and suppressed\nbreath, lest they should lose any part of what was to ensue.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.When the Duke of Rothsay saw the expression which occupied the stern\nfeatures of Douglas, and remarked that the Earl did not make the\nleast motion towards respectful, or even civil, salutation, he seemed\ndetermined to show him how little respect he was disposed to pay to his\ndispleased looks.\"Here, pretty one,\" he said, \"I give thee one gold piece for the song\nthou hast sung me, another for the nuts I have stolen from thee, and a\nthird for the kiss thou art about to give me.For know, my pretty one,\nthat when fair lips, and thine for fault of better may be called so,\nmake sweet music for my pleasure, I am sworn to St.\"My song is recompensed nobly,\" said Louise, shrinking back;

\"you must not thwart his humor.\"\"But I cannot reach your lordship,\" she said, timidly, \"you sit so high\non horseback.\"\"If I must alight,\" said Rothsay, \"there shall be the heavier penalty.Place thy foot on the toe of my boot,\ngive me hold of thy hand.He kissed her as she stood\nthus suspended in the air, perched upon his foot and supported by his\nhand; saying, \"There is thy kiss, and there is my purse to pay it; and\nto grace thee farther, Rothsay will wear thy scrip for the day.\"He suffered the frightened girl to spring to the ground, and turned his\nlooks from her to bend them contemptuously on the Earl of Douglas, as\nif he had said, \"All this I do in despite of you and of your daughter's\nclaims.\"said the Earl, pressing towards the Prince,\n\"this is too much, unmannered boy, as void of sense as honour!You know\nwhat considerations restrain the hand of Douglas, else had you never\ndared--\"\n\n\"Can you play at spang cockle, my lord?\"said the Prince, placing a nut\non the second joint of his forefinger, and spinning it off by a smart\napplication of the thumb.The nut struck on Douglas's broad breast,\nwho burst out into a dreadful exclamation of wrath, inarticulate, but\nresembling the growl of a lion in depth and sternness of expression.\"I cry your pardon, most mighty lord,\" said the Duke of Rothsay,\nscornfully, while all around trembled; \"I did not conceive my pellet\ncould have wounded you, seeing you wear a buff coat.Surely, I trust, it\ndid not hit your eye?\"The prior, despatched by the King, as we have seen in the last chapter,\nhad by this time made way through the crowd, and laying hold on\nDouglas's rein, in a manner that made it impossible for him to advance,\nreminded him that the Prince was the son of his sovereign; and the\nhusband of his daughter.\"Fear not, sir prior,\" said Douglas.\"I despise the childish boy too\nmuch to raise a finger against him.Here, any of you who love the Douglas, spurn me this quean from the\nmonastery gates; and let her be so scourged that she may bitterly\nremember to the last day of her life how she gave means to an\nunrespective boy to affront the Douglas.\"Four or five retainers instantly stepped forth to execute commands which\nwere seldom uttered in vain, and heavily would Louise have atoned for an\noffence of which she was alike the innocent, unconscious, and unwilling\ninstrument, had not the Duke of Rothsay interfered.he said, in high indignation; \"scourge\nher for obeying my commands!Spurn thine own oppressed vassals, rude\nearl--scourge thine own faulty hounds; but beware how you touch so much\nas a dog that Rothsay hath patted on the head, far less a female whose\nlips he hath kissed!\"Before Douglas could give an answer, which would certainly have been\nin defiance, there arose that great tumult at the outward gate of the\nmonastery, already noticed, and men both on horseback and on foot\nbegan to rush headlong in, not actually fighting with each other, but\ncertainly in no peaceable manner.One of the contending parties, seemingly, were partizans of Douglas,\nknown by the cognizance of the bloody heart; the other were composed of\ncitizens of the town of Perth.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.It appeared they had been skirmishing in\nearnest when without the gates, but, out of respect to the sanctified\nground, they lowered their weapons when they entered, and confined their\nstrife to a war of words and mutual abuse.The tumult had this good effect, that it forced asunder, by the weight\nand press of numbers, the Prince and Douglas, at a moment when the\nlevity of the former and the pride of the latter were urging both to the\nutmost extremity.But now peacemakers interfered on all sides.The prior\nand the monks threw themselves among the multitude, and commanded\npeace in the name of Heaven, and reverence to their sacred walls,\nunder penalty of excommunication; and their expostulations began to\nbe listened to.Albany, who was despatched by his royal brother at the\nbeginning of the fray, had not arrived till now on the scene of action.He instantly applied himself to Douglas, and in his ear conjured him to\ntemper his passion.Bride of Douglas, I will be avenged!\"\"No man\nshall brook life after he has passed an affront on Douglas.\"\"Why, so you may be avenged in fitting time,\" said Albany;

for, as\nyour Highness knows, it is the smith who makes the man at arms, and men\nwith good weapons are a match for great odds.\"In an early\nstate of things no form of government is so natural as that which\nwe find established among our forefathers.A feeling which was not\nwholly sentimental demanded that the King should, under all ordinary\ncircumstances, be the descendant of former Kings.But a sense that\nsome personal qualification was needed in a ruler required that the\nelectors should have the right of freely choosing within the royal\nhouse.In days when Kings governed as well as reigned, such a choice,\nmade with some regard to the personal qualities of the King chosen, was\nthe best means for securing freedom and good government.Under the rule\nof a conventional constitution, when Kings reign but do not govern,\nwhen it is openly professed in the House of Commons that it is to that\nHouse that the powers of government have passed(49), the objects\nwhich were once best secured by making kingship elective are now best\nsecured by making kingship hereditary.It is as the Spartan King said:\nby lessening the powers of the Crown, its possession has become more\nlasting(50).A political system like ours would be inconsistent with\nan elective kingship.An elective King could not be trusted simply to\nreign; he would assuredly govern, or try to govern.We need not suppose\nthat he would attempt any breaches of the written Law.But those powers\nwhich the written Law attaches to the Crown he would assuredly try to\nexercise according to his own personal views of what was right and\nexpedient.And he would assuredly be justified in so doing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.For the\npersonal choice of a certain man to be King would in all reason be held\nto imply that he was personally fit for the work of government.He\nwould be a President or Prime Minister chosen for life, one whom there\nwould be no means of removing from office except by the most extreme\nand most unusual exercise of the powers of Parliament.There are states\nof society in which an elective Monarchy is a better kind of government\nthan either a Commonwealth or an hereditary Monarchy.But, under the\npresent circumstances of the civilized states of Europe and America,\nthe choice lies between the hereditary Monarchy and the Commonwealth.The circumstances of our history have made us an hereditary Monarchy,\njust as the circumstances of the history of Switzerland have made that\ncountry a Federal Commonwealth.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.And no reasonable person will seek to\ndisturb an institution which, like other English institutions, has\ngrown up because it was wanted(51).<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Our unwritten Constitution, which\ngives us an hereditary Sovereign, but which requires his government to\nbe carried on by Ministers who are practically chosen by the House of\nCommons, does in effect attain the same objects which were sought to\nbe attained by the elective kingship of our forefathers.Our system\ngives the State a personal chief, a personal embodiment of the national\nbeing, which draws to itself those feelings of personal homage and\npersonal duty which a large class of mankind find it hard to look\nupon as due to the more abstract ideas of Law and Commonwealth.And,\nwhen the duties of constitutional royalty are discharged as our own\nexperience tells us that they may be discharged, the feeling awakened\nis more than a mere sentiment; it is a rational feeling of genuine\npersonal respect.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.But widely as the hereditary kingship of our latest\ntimes differs in outward form from the hereditary kingship of our\nearliest times, the two have points of likeness which are not shared by\nkingship in the form which it took in the ages between the two.In our\nearliest and in our latest system, the King exists for the sake of the\npeople; in the intermediate times it sometimes seemed that the people\nexisted for the sake of the King.In our earliest and in our latest\nsystem, the King is clothed with an office, the duties of which are to\nbe discharged for the common good of all.In the intermediate times it\nsometimes seemed as if the King had been made master of a possession\nwhich was to be enjoyed for his personal pleasure and profit.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.In the\nintermediate times we constantly hear of the rights and powers of the\nCrown as something distinct from, and almost hostile to, the common\nrights of the people.In our earliest and in our latest times, the\nrights of the Crown and the rights of the people are the same, for it\nis allowed that the powers of the Crown are to be exercised for the\nwelfare of the people by the advice and consent of the people or their\nrepresentatives.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the apple.Without indulging in any Utopian dreams, without\npicturing to ourselves the", "question": "Where is the apple?

and this occurs the more readily the larger the\nproportion of this substance held in solution.Cholesterin is an\nexcrementitious material found in the blood and excreted by the liver.It represents in part, probably, the waste of nervous matter, but more\ncertainly of the fatty tissues in general.Conditions of the system in\nwhich the metamorphosis of the fatty elements occurs more freely--as\nobesity, advancing life, etc.--are accompanied by an increased\nproduction and excretion of cholesterin.So long as the neutral state or the alkalinity of the bile is\nmaintained, the cholesterin will be kept in solution, although its\nrelative proportion may be in excess of the normal.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.A lack of the soda\nconstituent of the system is one factor, but the most important is a\ncatarrhal state of the mucous membrane of the bile-ducts and\ngall-bladder.The mucus formed plays a double role: it furnishes a\nnucleus about which cholesterin crystallizes; it acts as a ferment and\ninaugurates a process of acid fermentation which results in the\nprecipitation of cholesterin.When all the conditions favorable to the\nseparation and crystallization of cholesterin are present, any foreign\nbody may serve the purpose of a nucleus.The articles which have thus\nserved have been enumerated.A by no means infrequent combination is that of bilirubin with calcium;\nand this may constitute the nucleus or form a part of the body or the\ncrust of a calculus.The mechanism of its formation is not unlike that\nof the cholesterin concretion.Bilirubin is soluble in alkalies, and is\nprecipitated from its solution by acids.It follows that when acid\nfermentation takes places under the influence of mucus, bilirubin may\nbe precipitated in combination with calcium.The salts of sodium and\npotassium are much more abundant in bile than those of lime, but the\nlatter much more often enter into the formation of calculi because of\ntheir slighter solubility.Other combinations of bile-pigments, mucus,\nand the salts of the bile take place, but they are relatively less\nfrequent.The principal lime salt is the carbonate, and this combines\nin varying proportions with the bile acids, the fat acids, and\nbile-pigment.Certain physical conditions are not less important than the chemical in\nthe production of hepatic calculi.Accumulation of bile in the\ngall-bladder, stasis, and concentration are essential conditions.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.If\nbile remains long in the gall-bladder, it becomes darker in color and\nmore viscid, its specific gravity rises, and the relative proportion of\nsolids increases, doubtless because of the absorption of a part of the\nwater.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.The reaction--which, as has been stated, is in the fresh state\nneutral or {1063} alkaline--becomes acid in consequence of a\nfermentative change (Von Gorup-Besanez) set up by the mucus.If a\ncatarrhal state of the mucous membrane exist, the mucus, epithelium,\nand lymphoid cells cast off play the part of a ferment.The lime which\nis so important a constituent of biliary concretions is not present\neven in concentrated bile in sufficient amount to account for its\nagency in the formation of these bodies, is furnished by the diseased\nmucous membrane (Frerichs).Indeed, numerous crystals of carbonate of\nlime have been seen in situ in contact with the mucous membrane in\ncases of chronic catarrh.It follows, then, that catarrh of the biliary\npassages has an important causative relation to that pathological\ncondition of the bile which precedes the formation of calculi.In this\nconnection we must not lose sight of the researches made by Ord[157] on\nthe action exerted by colloids on the formation of concretions.The\nmucus is the colloid; cholesterin, lime, and soda salts are the\ncrystalloids.These latter diffusing through the colloid medium, the\nresulting combinations assume spheroidal forms.The union of bilirubin\nand lime salts illustrates the same principle.[Footnote 157: _On the Influence of Colloids upon Crystalline Forms and\nCohesion, with Observations on the Structure and Mode of Formation of\nUrinary and other Calculi_, by W. Miller Ord, M.D., F.R.C.P.Lond.,\netc., London, 1879.]CAUSES.--We have here to consider the external conditions and the\ngeneral somatic influences which lead to the formation of biliary\nconcretions.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.Besides other\nagencies due to advancing life, the increase of cholesterin is an\ninfluential factor.The less active state of the functions in general,\ndiminished oxidation, loss of water, and concentration of the bile are\ninfluential factors in determining the formation of hepatic calculi in\nadvancing life, as the opposite conditions oppose their production in\nearly life.Although not unknown in infancy, at this period in life and\nuntil twenty years of age they occur but rarely.Fauconneau-Dufresne,[158] of 91 cases, had 4 in infants; Wolff[159] had\n1 in a collection of 45 cases; and Cyr,[160] 2 cases under ten in a\ngroup of 558 cases.The following table illustrates the influence of\nage on the productivity of gall-stones:\n\n  AUTHORS.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.395\n    From infancy to 30   18\n    From 30-70          377\n\n  FAUCONNEAU-DUFRESNE.91\n    Before 20", "question": "Where is the football?

and hence it is necessary to bear in mind the\nextreme latitude of his diagnosis.Of my own collection, 30 in number,\nall doubtful cases {1064} excluded, there were 20 between thirty and\nfifty years, and 10 between fifty and seventy.Of these, 22 occurred in\nsubjects between forty and sixty.The period of maximum liability is\nabout fifty years of age.Cyr refers the difference of his statistics\nfrom those of other observers to the character of the patients.The\npreponderance in the number of cases of hepatic calculi at or about the\nfiftieth year is referable to the lessened activity of the nutritive\nfunctions at this period, and to the increase in the relative\nproportion of cholesterin in the blood in advanced life (Luton[161]).Charcot[162] maintains that after sixty biliary calculi are more\nfrequent, but owing to the physiological conditions then existing the\nmigration of these bodies is effected without notable inconvenience.[Footnote 161: Jaccoud's _Dictionnaire encycloped._, art.\"Voies\nBiliaires;\" _idem._, _Bull.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.de Therap._, March 15, 1866.][Footnote 162: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.According to most authorities, females are more liable to the formation\nof gall-stones than are men.Thudicum, after an analysis of the\nstatistics given by the most experienced and celebrated authorities,\nplaces the proportion at 3 to 2.Von Schuppel gives the same figures.Cyr, whilst recognizing this estimate as true of the great mass of\nobservations on this point, finds that in his own cases the\npreponderance of females over males was even greater, being 4 to\n1--inversely to the liability of the sexes to gout; but this excess is\nto be explained by the character of the subjects falling under his\nobservation.Women are subjected to influences which favor the\nformation of these concretions, such as pregnancy, sedentary habits,\ndiet of a restricted character, the use of corsets, and the somatic\nchanges at the climacteric period.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.The social state, by reason of the conditions associated with a good\nposition in life, has an influence in the production of calculi.Luxurious habits and indulgence in the pleasures of the table are\nimportant factors, and hence this malady is encountered amongst the\nbetter class of patients in private practice rather than amongst\nlaboring people in the hospitals.As the somatic conditions which exert a predisposing action, and the\nsocial circumstances also favoring the formation of hepatic calculi,\nare transmitted, heredity is by some classed among the etiological\nfactors, but it can only be regarded as indirect.Malarial influences unquestionably exert a very powerful influence as\nthis malady occurs in this country.Paroxysms of intermittent either\ninduce or accompany the seizures of hepatic colic, and chronic malarial\npoisoning exerts a direct causative influence through the hepatic\ndisturbances and the gastro-duodenal catarrh which are associated with\nit.Attacks of hepatic colic are extremely frequent in the malarial\nregions of the West and South.It may be, however, that this malady is\nfrequent rather in consequence of the diet of pork than of climatic\ncauses, for it is probable that indulgence in such food plays an\nimportant part in the formation of biliary concretions (Harley).Due\nallowance made for diet, climate is yet, no doubt, an influential\nfactor.In warm, especially in malarial, regions the functions of the\nliver are taxed to compensate for the increased action of the skin and\nlungs; but this organ is, besides, affected by the poison of malaria,\nand to the congestion caused by it is superadded a catarrhal state of\nthe bile-ducts and of the duodenum.A {1065} pathological condition of\nthe bile itself is first induced; then the fermentative changes set up\nby the mucus cause the separation and crystallization of pigment and\ncholesterin.\"I'm very sorry, Ginger,\" ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds\nout of Ginger's pocket.\"I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.If you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as\nI've done.\"He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.Ginger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead.\"Eight and six is fifteen,\" ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody\ncoming up the stairs.Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came\ninto the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling\n'is 'ead from side to side.\"He's all right,\" ses Bill;

and it is a\nfavourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which\nreverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave.A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and\nout again, into the sunshiny open sea.Which we had now got used to;\nand it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting\nto John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face.We felt sad to\nthink this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard\ncoast.But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to\nrow.Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery\nsea-weedy rocks.In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this\nfeat, and then--\n\nWell, it is over, and I sit here writing these details.But I would\nnot do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and\nhaving a row with John Curgenven.he looked relieved when he saw \"the old lady\" safe on\n_terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he \"rocked in his\nboat in the bay.\"May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to\nhim!May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few!I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do\ntheirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he \"will know the reason\nwhy.\"Charles was ready;

and surely\nenough I found beauty sufficient to dissolve my weariness, had it been\ntenfold multiplied, and to allay my pulse, had it throbbed with the\nvehemence of fever.An oblong valley girdled a lovely lake on every side;\nhere with precipitous impending cliffs, and there with grassy <DW72>s of\nfreshest emerald that seemed to woo the dimpling waters to lave their\nloving margins, and, as if moved with a like impulse, the little wavelets\nmet the call with the gentle dalliance of their ebb and flow.A small\nwooded island, with its fringe of willows trailing in the water, stood\nabout a furlong from the hither side, and in the centre of its tangled\nbrake, my elevation enabled me to descry what I may call the remnants of\na ruin--for so far had it gone in its decay--here green, there grey, as\nthe moss, the ivy, or the pallid stains of time, had happened to prevail.A wild duck, with its half-fledged clutch, floated fearless from its\nsedgy shore.More remote, a fishing heron stood motionless on a stone,\nintent on its expected prey; and the only other animated feature in the\nquiet scene was a fisherman who had just moored his little boat, and\nhaving settled his tackle, was slinging his basket on his arm and turning\nupward in the direction where I lay.I watched the old man toiling up\nthe steep, and as he drew nigh, hailed him, as I could not suffer him to\npass without learning at least the name, if it had one, of this miniature\nAmhara.He readily complied, and placing his fish-basket on the ground,\nseated himself beside it, not unwilling to recover his breath and recruit\nhis scanty stock of strength almost expended in the ascent.\u201cWe call it,\u201d\nsaid he in answer to my query, \u201cthe Lake of the Ruin, or sometimes, to\nsuch as know the story, the Lake of the Lovers,", "question": "Where is the apple?

but I have to go\nto the Hall, and that\u2019s five long miles off, with my fish for dinner, and\nlittle time you\u2019ll say I have to spare, though it be down hill nearly all\nthe way.\u201d It would have been too bad to allow such a well-met chronicler\nto pass unpumped, and, putting more faith in the attractions of my pocket\nthan of my person, I produced on the instant my luncheon-case and\nflask, and handing him a handsome half of the contents of the former,\nmade pretty sure of his company for a time, by keeping the latter in my\nown possession till I got him regularly launched in the story, when, to\nquicken at once his recollection and his elocution, I treated him to an\ninspiring draught.When he had told his tale, he left me with many thanks\nfor the refection; and I descending to his boat, entered it, and with the\naid of a broken oar contrived to scull myself over to the island, the\nscene of the final fortunes of Connor O\u2019Rourke and Norah M\u2019Diarmod, the\nfaithful-hearted but evil-fated pair who were in some sort perpetuated in\nits name.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.There, in sooth, within the crumbled walls, was the gravestone\nwhich covered the dust of him the brave and her the beautiful; and\nseating myself on the fragment of a sculptured capital, that showed\nhow elaborately reared the ruined edifice had been, I bethought me how\npoorly man\u2019s existence shows even beside the work of his own hands, and\nendeavoured for a time to make my thoughts run parallel with the history\nof this once-venerated but now forsaken, and, save by a few, forgotten\nstructure; but finding myself fail in the attempt, settled my retrospect\non that brief period wherein it was identified with the two departed\nlovers whose story I had just heard, and which, as I sat by their lowly\nsepulchre, I again repeated to myself.This lake, as my informant told me, once formed a part of the boundary\nbetween the possessions of O\u2019Rourke the Left-handed and M\u2019Diarmod the\nDark-faced, as they were respectively distinguished, two small rival\nchiefs, petty in property but pre-eminent in passion, to whom a most\nmagnificent mutual hatred had been from generations back \u201cbequeathed from\nbleeding sire to son\u201d--a legacy constantly swelled by accruing outrages,\nfor their paramount pursuits were plotting each other\u2019s detriment or\ndestruction, planning or parrying plundering inroads, inflicting or\navenging injuries by open violence or secret subtlety, as seemed more\nlikely to promote their purposes.At the name of an O\u2019Rourke, M\u2019Diarmod\nwould clutch his battle-axe, and brandish it as if one of the detested\nclan were within its sweep: and his rival, nothing behind in hatred,\nwould make the air echo to his deep-drawn imprecation on M\u2019Diarmod\nand all his abominated breed when any thing like an opportunity was\nafforded him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.Their retainers of course shared the same spirit of mutual\nabhorrence, exaggerated indeed, if that were possible, by their more\nfrequent exposure to loss in cattle and in crops, for, as is wont to be\nthe case, the cottage was incontinently ravaged when the stronghold was\nprudentially respected.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.O\u2019Rourke had a son, an only one, who promised\nto sustain or even raise the reputation of the clan, for the youth knew\nnot what it was to blench before flesh and blood--his feet were over\nforemost, in the wolf-hunt or the foray, and in agility, in valour, or\nin vigour, none within the compass of a long day\u2019s travel could stand\nin comparison with young Connor O\u2019Rourke.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.Detestation of the M\u2019Diarmods\nhad been studiously instilled from infancy, of course; but although the\nyouth\u2019s cheek would flush and his heart beat high when any perilous\nadventure was the theme, yet, so far at least, it sprang more from\nthe love of prowess and applause than from the deadly hostility that\nthrilled in the pulses of his father and his followers.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.In the necessary\nintervals of forbearance, as in seed-time, harvest, or other brief\nbreathing-spaces, he would follow the somewhat analogous and bracing\npleasures of the chase; and often would the wolf or the stag--for shaggy\nforests then clothed these bare and desert hills--fall before his spear\nor his dogs, as he fleetly urged the sport afoot.It chanced one evening\nthat in the ardour of pursuit he had followed a tough, long-winded stag\ninto the dangerous territory of M\u2019Diarmod.The chase had taken to the\nwater of the lake, and he with his dogs had plunged in after in the\nhope of heading it; but having failed in this, and in the hot flush of\na hunter\u2019s blood scorning to turn back, he pressed it till brought down\nwithin a few spear-casts of the M\u2019Diarmod\u2019s dwelling.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.Proud of having\nkilled his venison under the very nose of the latter, he turned homeward\nwith rapid steps; for, the fire of the chase abated, he felt how fatal\nwould be the discovery of his presence, and was thinking with complacency\nupon the wrath of the old chief on hearing of the contemptuous feat, when\nhis eye was arrested by a white figure moving slowly in the shimmering\nmists of nightfall by the margin of the lake.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.Though insensible to the\nfear of what was carnal and of the earth, he was very far from being so\nto what savoured of the supernatural, and, with a slight ejaculation half\nof surprise and half of prayer, he was about changing his course to give\nit a wider berth, when his dogs espied it, and, recking little of the\nspiritual in its appearance, bounded after it in pursuit.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.With a slight\nscream that proclaimed it feminine as well as human, the figure fled, and\nthe youth had much to do both with legs and lungs to reach her in time to\npreserve her from the rough respects of his ungallant escort.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the football.Beautiful\nindignation lightened from the dark eyes and sat on the pouting lip of\nNorah M\u2019Diarmod--for it was the chieftain\u2019s daughter--as she turned\ndisdainfully towards him.\u201cIs it the bravery of an O\u2019Rourke to hunt a woman with his dogs?<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.Young\nchief, you stand upon the ground of M\u2019Diarmod, and your name from the\nlips of her\u201d--she stopped, for she had time to glance again upon his\nfeatures, and had no longer heart to upbraid one who owned<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.", "question": "Where is the apple?

he had occasionally caught distant glimpses of\nher graceful figure; and the present sight, or after recollection, often\nmitigated his feelings to her hostile clan, and, to his advantage, the\nrugged old chief was generally associated with the lovely dark-eyed girl\nwho was his only child.Such being their respective feelings, what could be the result of\ntheir romantic rencounter?They were both young, generous children\nof nature, with hearts fraught with the unhacknied feelings of youth\nand inexperience: they had drunk in sentiment with the sublimities\nof their mountain homes, and were fitted for higher things than the\nvulgar interchange of animosity and contempt.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Of this they soon were\nconscious, and they did not separate until the stars began to burn above\nthem, and not even then, before they had made arrangements for at least\nanother--one more secret interview.The islet possessed a beautiful\nfitness for their trysting place, as being accessible from either side,\nand little obnoxious to observation; and many a moonlight meeting--for\nthe _one_ was inevitably multiplied--had these children of hostile\nfathers, perchance on the very spot on which my eyes now rested, and\nthe unbroken stillness around had echoed to their gladsome greetings or\ntheir faltering farewells.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.Neither dared to divulge an intercourse that\nwould have stirred to frenzy the treasured rancour of their respective\nparents, each of whom would doubtless have preferred a connexion with\na blackamoor--if such were then in circulation--to their doing such\ngrievous despite to that ancient feud which as an heirloom had been\ntransmitted from ancestors whose very names they scarcely knew.M\u2019Diarmod\nthe Dark-faced was at best but a gentle tiger even to his only child; and\nthough his stern cast-iron countenance would now and then relax beneath\nher artless blandishments, yet even with the lovely vision at his side,\nhe would often grimly deplore that she had not been a son, to uphold the\nname and inherit the headship of the clan, which on his demise would\nprobably pass from its lineal course; and when he heard of the bold\nbearing of the heir of O\u2019Rourke, he thought he read therein the downfall\nof the M\u2019Diarmods when he their chief was gone.With such ill-smothered\nfeelings of discontent he could not but in some measure repulse the\nfilial regards of Norah, and thus the confiding submission that would\nhave sprung to meet the endearments of his love, was gradually refused\nto the inconsistencies of his caprice; and the maiden in her intercourse\nwith her proscribed lover rarely thought of her father, except as one\nfrom whom it should be diligently concealed.One of the night marauders of his\nclan chanced in an evil hour to see Connor O\u2019Rourke guiding his coracle\nto the island, and at the same time a cloaked female push cautiously\nfrom the opposite shore for the same spot.Surprised, he crouched among\nthe fern till their landing and joyous greeting put all doubt of their\nfriendly understanding to flight; and then, thinking only of revenge or\nransom, the unsentimental scoundrel hurried round the lake to M\u2019Diarmod,\nand informed him that the son of his mortal foe was within his reach.The old man leaped from his couch of rushes at the thrilling news, and,\nstanding on his threshold, uttered a low gathering-cry, which speedily\nbrought a dozen of his more immediate retainers to his presence.As he\npassed his daughter\u2019s apartment, he for the first time asked himself who\ncan the woman be?and at the same moment almost casually glanced at\nNorah\u2019s chamber, to see that all there was quiet for the night.A shudder\nof vague terror ran through his sturdy frame as his eye fell on the low\nopen window.He thrust in his head, but no sleeper drew breath within; he\nre-entered the house and called aloud upon his daughter, but the echo of\nher name was the only answer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.A kern coming up put an end to the search,\nby telling that he had seen his young mistress walking down to the\nwater\u2019s edge about an hour before, but that, as she had been in the habit\nof doing so by night for some time past, he had thought but little of it.The odious truth was now revealed, and, trembling with the sudden gust of\nfury, the old chief with difficulty rushed to the lake, and, filling a\ncouple of boats with his men, told them to pull for the honour of their\nname and for the head of the O\u2019Rourke\u2019s first-born.During this stormy prelude to a bloody drama, the doomed but unconscious\nConnor was sitting secure within the dilapidated chapel by the side\nof her whom he had won.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.Her quickened ear first caught the dip of an\noar, and she told her lover; but he said it was the moaning of the\nnight-breeze through the willows, or the ripple of the water among the\nstones, and went on with his gentle dalliance.A few minutes, however,\nand the shock of the keels upon the ground, the tread of many feet, and\nthe no longer suppressed cries of the M\u2019Diarmods, warned him to stand on\nhis defence; and as he sprang from his seat to meet the call, the soft\nillumination of love was changed with fearful suddenness into the baleful\nfire of fierce hostility.\u201cMy Norah, leave me; you may by chance be rudely handled in the scuffle.\u201d\n\nThe terrified but faithful girl fell upon his breast.\u201cConnor, your fate is mine;

E. R. Rees, one of the surviving defenders, which I had\nnever before seen, and on page 224 the following statement is given\nregarding the entry of Havelock's force.After describing the prevailing\nexcitement the writer goes on to say: \"The shrill tones of the\nHighlanders' bagpipes now pierced our ears; not the most beautiful music\nwas ever more welcome or more joy-bringing,\" and so on.Further on, on\npage 226: \"The enemy found some of us dancing to the sounds of the\nHighlanders' pipes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.The remembrance of that happy evening will never be\neffaced from my memory.\"While yet again, on page 237, he gives the\nstory related by me below about the Highland piper putting some of the\nenemy's cavalry to flight by a blast from his pipes.So much in proof of\nthe fact that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders had their bagpipes with\nthem, and played them too, at the first relief of Lucknow.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.I must now devote a few remarks to the incident of Jessie Brown, which\nGrace Campbell has immortalised in the song known as _Jessie's Dream_.In the _Indian Empire_, by R.

and this, that is to say,\nthe loss of the knowledge of the figure of each object, will make the\nsame object appear more remote.The eye can never arrive at a perfect knowledge of the interval between\ntwo objects variously distant, by means of the linear perspective\nalone, if not assisted by the perspective of colours.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.CCLXXXIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._\n\n\n/The/ air will participate less of the azure of the sky, in proportion\nas it comes nearer to the horizon, as it is proved by the third and\nninth proposition[70], that pure and subtile bodies (such as compose\nthe air) will be less illuminated by the sun than those of thicker and\ngrosser substance: and as it is certain that the air which is remote\nfrom the earth, is thinner than that which is near it, it will follow,\nthat the latter will be more impregnated with the rays of the sun,\nwhich giving light at the same time to an infinity of atoms floating\nin this air, renders it more sensible to the eye.So that the air will\nappear lighter towards the horizon, and darker as well as bluer in\nlooking up to the sky; because there is more of the thick air between\nour eyes and the horizon, than between our eyes and that part of the\nsky above our heads.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.[Illustration]\n\nFor instance: if the eye placed in P, looks through the air along the\nline P R, and then lowers itself a little along P S, the air will begin\nto appear a little whiter, because there is more of the thick air in\nthis space than in the first.And if it be still removed lower, so\nas to look straight at the horizon, no more of that blue sky will be\nperceived which was observable along the first line P R, because there\nis a much greater quantity of thick air along the horizontal line P D,\nthan along the oblique P S, or the perpendicular P R.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.CCLXXXV./--_The Cause of the Diminution of Colours._\n\n\n/The/ natural colour of any visible object will be diminished in\nproportion to the density of any other substance which interposes\nbetween that object and the eye.CCLXXXVI./--_Of the Diminution of Colours and Objects._\n\n\n/Let/ the colours vanish in proportion as the objects diminish in size,\naccording to the distance.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.CCLXXXVII./--_Of the Variety observable in Colours, according to\ntheir Distance, or Proximity._\n\n\n/The/ local colour of such objects as are darker than the air, will\nappear less dark as they are more remote; and, on the contrary, objects\nlighter than the air will lose their brightness in proportion to their\ndistance from the eye.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.In general, all objects that are darker or\nlighter than the air, are discoloured by distance, which changes their\nquality, so that the lighter appears darker, and the darker lighter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk.CCLXXXVIII./--_At what Distance Colours are entirely lost._\n\n\n/Local/ colours are entirely lost at a greater or less distance,\naccording as the eye and the object are more or less elevated from the\nearth.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.This is proved by the seventh proposition[71], which says, the\nair is more or less pure, as it is near to, or remote from the earth.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.If the eye then, and the object are near the earth, the thickness of\nthe air which interposes, will in a great measure confuse the colour of\nthat object to the eye.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.But if the eye and the object are placed high\nabove the earth, the air will disturb the natural colour of that object\nvery little.In short, the various gradations of colour depend not only\non the various distances, in which they may be lost; but also on the\nvariety of lights, which change according to the different hours of the\nday, and the thickness or purity of the air, through which the colour\nof the object is conveyed to the eye.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.CCLXXXIX./--_Of the Change observable in the same Colour,\naccording to its Distance from the Eye._\n\n\n/Among/ several colours of the same nature, that which is the nearest\nto the eye will alter the least; because the air which interposes\nbetween the eye and the object seen, envelopes, in some measure, that\nobject.If the air, which interposes, be in great quantity, the object\nseen will be strongly tinged with the colour of that air;

Let us suppose that the\nspace A R, S P, is one degree of thin air, and S P E T another degree\nof thicker air.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.It will follow, that the first colour, E, will pass\nto the eye through one degree of thick air, E S, and through another\ndegree, S A, of thinner air.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.And B will send its colour to the eye in\nA, through two degrees of thick air, and through two others of the\nthinner sort.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.C will send it through three degrees of the thin, and\nthree of the thick sort, while D goes through four degrees of the one,\nand four of the other.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.This demonstrates, that the gradation of colours\nis in proportion to their distance from the eye[72].But this happens\nonly to those colours which are on a level with the eye;

and, on the\ncontrary, those will preserve their proper colour at the greatest\ndistance, that are most dissimilar to black.The green therefore of the fields will change sooner into blue than\nyellow, or white, which will preserve their natural colour at a greater\ndistance than that, or even red.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.CCXCVII./--_How it happens that Colours do not change, though\nplaced in different Qualities of Air._\n\n\n/The/ colour will not be subject to any alteration when the distance\nand the quality of air have a reciprocal proportion.What it loses by\nthe distance it regains by the purity of the air, viz.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.if we suppose\nthe first or lowest air to have four degrees of thickness, and the\ncolour to be at one degree from the eye, and the second air above to\nhave three degrees.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.The air having lost one degree of thickness, the\ncolour will acquire one degree upon the distance.And when the air\nstill higher shall have lost two degrees of thickness, the colour will\nacquire as many upon the distance;

because in rising\nit has acquired those three degrees which it was losing by the same\ndistance from the eye; and this is what was meant to be proved.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.CCXCVIII./--_Why Colours experience no apparent Change, though\nplaced in different Qualities of Air._\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n/It/ may happen that a colour does not alter, though placed at\ndifferent distances, when the thickness of the air and the distance\nare in the same inverse proportion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.It is proved thus: let A be the\neye, and H any colour whatever, placed at one degree of distance\nfrom the eye, in a quality of air of four degrees of thickness; but\nbecause the second degree above, A M N L, contains a thinner air by\none half, which air conveys this colour, it follows that this colour\nwill appear as if removed double the distance it was at before, viz.at two degrees of distance, A F and F G, from the eye; and it will be\nplaced in G. If that is raised to the second degree of air A M N L, and\nto the degree O M, P N, it will necessarily be placed at E, and will\nbe removed from the eye the whole length of the line A E, which will\nbe proved in this manner to be equal in thickness to the distance A G.\nIf in the same quality of air the distance A G interposed between the\neye and the colour occupies two degrees, and A E occupies two degrees\nand a half, it is sufficient to preserve the colour G, when raised to\nE, from any change, because the degree A C and the degree A F being\nthe same in thickness, are equal and alike, and the degree C D, though\nequal in length to the degree F G, is not alike", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "And we shall prove it thus: reckoning\nfirst the thickness of air, the colour H is placed in four degrees of\nthickness, the colour G in two degrees, and E at one degree.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Now let\nus see whether the distances are in an equal inverse proportion; the\ncolour E is at two degrees and a half of distance, G at two degrees,\nand H at one degree.But as this distance has not an exact proportion\nwith the thickness of air, it is necessary to make a third calculation\nin this manner: A C is perfectly like and equal to A F; the half\ndegree, C B, is like but not equal to A F, because it is only half a\ndegree in length, which is equal to a whole degree of the quality of\nthe air above; so that by this calculation we shall solve the question.For A C is equal to two degrees of thickness of the air above, and the\nhalf degree C B is equal to a whole degree of the same air above; and\none degree more is to be taken in, viz.A H has four degrees of thickness of air, A G also four, viz.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.A F two\nin value, and F G also two, which taken together make four.A E has\nalso four, because A C contains two, and C D one, which is the half\nof A C, and in the same quality of air; and there is a whole degree\nabove in the thin air, which all together make four.So that if A E is\nnot double the distance A G, nor four times the distance A H, it is\nmade equivalent by the half degree C B of thick air, which is equal\nto a whole degree of thin air above.This proves the truth of the\nproposition, that the colour H G E does not undergo any alteration by\nthese different distances.CCXCIX./--_Contrary Opinions in regard to Objects seen afar off._\n\n\n/Many/ painters will represent the objects darker, in proportion as\nthey are removed from the eye; but this cannot be true, unless the\nobjects seen be white; as shall be examined in the next chapter.CCC./--_Of the Colour of Objects remote from the Eye._\n\n\n/The/ air tinges objects with its own colour more or less in proportion\nto the quantity of intervening air between it and the eye, so that a\ndark object at the distance of two miles (or a density of air equal to\nsuch distance), will be more tinged with its colour than if only one\nmile distant.It is said, that, in a landscape, trees of the same species appear\ndarker in the distance than near; this cannot be true, if they be of\nequal size, and divided by equal spaces.But it will be so if the\nfirst trees are scattered, and the light of the fields is seen through\nand between them, while the others which are farther off, are thick\ntogether, as is often the case near some river or other piece of water:\nin this case no space of light fields can be perceived, but the trees\nappear thick together, accumulating the shadow on each other.It also\nhappens, that as the shady parts of plants are much broader than the\nlight ones, the colour of the plants becoming darker by the multiplied\nshadows, is preserved, and conveyed to the eye more strongly than that\nof the other parts; these masses, therefore, will carry the strongest\nparts of their colour to a greater distance.CCCI./--_Of the Colour of Mountains._\n\n\n/The/ darker the mountain is in itself, the bluer it will appear at a\ngreat distance.The highest part will be the darkest, as being more\nwoody; because woods cover a great many shrubs, and other plants,\nwhich never receive any light.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from\nthe north somewhere.\"The \"nice girl\" was now a sweet silver-haired little\nlady of nearly eighty;

the\nNine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting\nthings, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the\nrising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might\nbe, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land's End!It is in great things as in small, the\nworry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.We\nhave done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the apple there.DAY THE TWELFTH\n\n\nMonday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing\nthat by the week's end our travels must be over and done, and that if\nwe wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next\nmorning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which\ninvolved taking this night \"a long, a last farewell\" of our comfortable\ncarriage and our faithful Charles.\"But it needn't be until night,\" said he, evidently loth to part from\nhis ladies.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.\"If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,\nmaster will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like\nto-day.\"\"Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,\nthen he'll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o'clock\nto get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it's a good road, though\nrather lonely.\"I should think it was, in the \"wee hours\" by the dim light of a waning\nmoon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,\nbut decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard's Head,\nLamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on\nno account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with\nscientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen\na single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of\nthat magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the\nday.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.\"I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,\nand I couldn't get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn't trouble anybody very much, mightn't we go again to\nWhitesand Bay?\"It was a heavenly day; to spend it\nin delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a\nrest for the next day's fatigue.there\nwould be no temptation to put on miners' clothes, and go dangling in\na basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was\nreported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but\nsome of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper\nair.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had \"no\ntime\" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard's Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a\nsecond view of the Land's End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we\nmade various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never\nhad the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that\nwe could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone\nthrough England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always\nseemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient\nchurch and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me\nsome ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark\n\"Sennen\" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,\nreleased for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,\nweighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling\nto their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of\nthe \"fine young fellow\" half a century ago.As we passed through the\nvillage with its pretty cottages and \"Lodgings to Let,\" we could not\nhelp thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for\na large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the\ncarriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,\ngradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was\nalmost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking\nyourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a\nparadise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about\nlike sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,\nshallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed\nbefore reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious\none, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we\nquite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such\na splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,\nand the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary\nfigure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless\na human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--mat", "question": "Where is the apple?

at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I\nseen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very\nminute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin's head.The\ncollecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical\ninterests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King\nStephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have\nlanded here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over\nby Tennyson in \"Maud\"--\"small, but a work divine\"?I think infinite\ngreatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the\nexceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,\nwho can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a\nglow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.The only imperfection in\ncreation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for\ndreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur\nof the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and\nbreaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed\nimpossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his\nwife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all\nhis other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the\nLand's End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful\nwe felt that we had \"done\" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased\nto have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the\nArmed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make\nout which was the knight and which was the lady.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Can it be that some\nfragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a \"fish-cellar,\" a\nlittle group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable\nfarewell of the Land's End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled\nor thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it\nwas another thing to carry them up again.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.I went in quest of a small\nboy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only\nunemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent\nair for not having \"cleaned\" himself, that I almost blushed to ask\nhim to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But\nhe accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most\ngraphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,\nmaking a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with\ntwo moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own\naccord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a\ngroup of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me\nhow many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what\nhard work it was.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she\nliked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at\nSennen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I\nhad parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in\ntime to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus\nbelli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser\npeople can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the\nstrong hand of \"intervention\"--civilised intervention--was best, and\nput an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore\nsum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent\nreason that I couldn't do it myself!)Therefore I\nconclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as\ntheir fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to\nPenzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of

lovely day was dying into an\nequally lovely evening.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Michael's Mount shone in the setting sun.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was\nquite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of\nMarazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign\nprincess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an\ninterest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,\nwith the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,\na year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von\nPawel-Rammingen, her father's secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval\nknight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Michael's\nMount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.You are not the learned

from a playing card at a hundred yards.\"\"Maybe he's a Western boy,\" laughed Sam.His father owns a big cattle ranch there, and Sanders\nlearned to shoot while rounding up cattle.They had passed over a small plain and were now working along a\nseries of rough rocks overgrown with scrub brush and creeping\nvines full of thorns.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.The thorns stuck everybody but Cujo, who\nknew exactly how to avoid them.\"Ise dun got scratched in'steen thousand places,\" groaned Aleck.\"Dis am worse dan a bramble bush twice ober, by golly!\"For two days the united expeditions kept on their way up the\nmountain side,  which sloped gradually at its base, the steeper\nportion still being several days' journey distant.During these days they shot several wild animals including a\nbeautiful antelope, while Sam caught a monkey.But the monkey bit\nthe boy in the shoulder, and Sam was glad enough to get rid of the\nmischievous creature.On the afternoon of the second day Cujo, who was slightly in\nadvance of the others, called a halt.\"Two men ahead ob us, up um mountain,\" he said.\"Cujo Vink one of\ndern King Susko.\"The

remain on guard for anything which\nmight turn up.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.Dick felt his heart beat rapidly as he advanced with his uncle and\nthe African guide through the tangle of thorns and over the rough\nrocks.He felt that by getting closer to King Susko, he was also\ngetting closer to the mystery which surrounded his father's\ndisappearance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved

to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.\"Come on, and we'll soon know something worth knowing, I feel\ncertain of it.\"Cujo now asked that he be allowed to proceed alone, to make\ncertain that no others of the Burnwo tribe were in the vicinity.\"We must be werry careful,\" he said.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\"Burnwos kill eberybody wot\nda find around here if not dare people.\"\"Evidently they want to keep the whole mountain of gold to\nthemselves,\" observed Dick.\"All right, Cujo, do as you think\nbest--I know we can rely upon you.\"After this they proceeded with more care than ever-along a rocky\nedge covered with loose stones.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.To one side was the mountain, to\nthe other a sheer descent of several hundred feet, and the\nfootpath was not over a yard wide.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.\"A tumble here would be a serious matter,\" said Randolph Rover.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the kitchen.\"Take good care, Dick, that you don't step on a rolling stone.\"But the ledge was passed in safety, and in fifteen minutes more\nthey were close to the opening is the side of the mountain.It\nwas an irregular hole about ten feet wide and twice as high.The\na rocks overhead stuck out for several yards, and from these hung\nnumerous vines, forming a sort of Japanese curtain over the\nopening.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.While the two Rovers waited behind a convenient rock, Cujo crawled\nforward on his hand and knees into the cave.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.They waited for ten\nminutes, just then it seemed an hour, but he did not reappear.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.\"Perhaps something has happened to him,\" returned Randolph Rover.\"I've had my pistol ready all along,\" answered the boy, exhibiting\nthe weapon.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.\"That encounter with the lion taught me a lesson.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.Dick broke off short, for a sound on the rocks

Amy banished the\nfaintest trace of doubt by her mirthful ecstasies; and after their\nmountain experience there was no ice to break between Gertrude and\nMaggie.The former was persuaded to defer her trip to New York until the morrow,\nand so Amy would have her nutting expedition after all.When Leonard came\ndown to dinner, Burt took Gertrude's hand, and said, \"Now, Len, this is\nyour only chance to give your consent.You can't have any dinner till you\ndo.\"His swift, deprecating look at Amy's laughing face reassured him.\"Well,\"\nhe said, slowly, as if trying to comprehend it all, \"I do believe I'm\ngrowing old.When _did_ all this take\nplace?\"\"Your eyesight is not to blame, Leonard,\" said his wife, with much\nsuperiority.Then, with a dignity that almost\nsurprised Gertrude, he, as eldest brother, welcomed her in simple,\nheartfelt words.At the dinner-table Miss Hargrove referred to the Western land.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.Burt laid\ndown his knife and fork, and exclaimed, \"I declare, I forgot all about\nit!\"Miss Hargrove laughed heartily as she said, \"A high tribute to me!\"and\nthen made known her father's statement that the Clifford tract in the\nWest adjoined his own, that it would soon be very valuable, and that he\nwas interested in the railroad approaching it.\"I left him,\" she\nconcluded, \"poring over his maps, and he told me to say to you, sir\" (to\nMr.Clifford), \"that he wished to see you soon.\"\"How about the four-leaved clover now?\"In the afternoon they started for the chestnut-trees.Webb carried a light\nladder, and both he and Burt had dressed themselves in close-fitting\nflannel suits for climbing.The orchard, as they passed through it,\npresented a beautiful autumn picture.Great heaps of yellow and red cheeked\napples were upon the ground; other varieties were in barrels, some headed\nup and ready for market, while Mr.Clifford was giving the final cooperage\nto other barrels as fast as they were filled.\"Father can still head up a barrel better than any of us,\" Leonard\nremarked to Miss Hargrove.\"Well, my dear,\" said the old gentleman, \"I've had over half a century's\nexperience.\"\"It's time I obtained some idea of rural affairs,\" said Gertrude to Webb.\"There seem to be many different kinds of apples here.\"Yes, as easily as you know different dress fabrics at Arnold's.Those\numbrella-shaped trees are Rhode Island greenings; those that are rather\nlong and slender branching are yellow bell-flowers; and those with short\nand stubby branches and twigs are the old-fashioned dominies.Don't you see how green the fruit is?It will not be\nin perfection till next March.Not only a summer, but an autumn and a\nwinter are required to perfect that superb apple, but then it becomes one\nof Nature's triumphs.Some of those heaps on the ground will furnish\ncider and vinegar.Nuts, cider, and a wood fire are among the privations\nof a farmer's life.\"\"Farming, as you carry it on, appears to me a fine art.How very full\nsome of the trees are!and others look as if they had been half picked\nover.\"The largest and ripest apples are taken\noff first, and the rest of the fruit improves wonderfully in two or three\nweeks.By this course we greatly increase both the quality and the bulk\nof the crop.\"\"You are very happy in your calling, Webb.How strange it seems for me to\nbe addressing you as Webb!\"\"It does not seem so strange to me;

his work was done.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.Yet he seemed to be making no move toward departure.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.She should miss him very much when he went, of\ncourse.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.But she did not like to feel that he was staying simply because\nhe had nowhere to go and nothing to do.Miss Maggie did not believe in\nable-bodied men who had nowhere to go and nothing to do--and she wanted\nvery much to believe in Mr.She had been under the impression that he was getting the Blaisdell\nmaterial together for a book, and that he was intending to publish it\nhimself.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.His book must be ready, but he was making no move to\npublish it.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple there.To Miss Maggie this could mean but one thing: some\nfinancial reverses had made it impossible for him to carry out his\nplans, and had left him stranded with no definite aim for the future.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.She was so sorry!--but there seemed to be nothing that she could do.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.She HAD tried to help by insisting that he pay less for his board; but\nhe had not only scouted that idea, but had brought her more chocolates\nand flowers than ever--for all the world as if he had divined her\nsuspicions and wished to disprove them.Smith was trying to keep something from her, Miss Maggie was\nsure.She was the more sure, perhaps, because she herself had something\nthat she was trying to keep from Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.Smith--and she thought she\nrecognized the symptoms.Meanwhile April budded into May, and May blossomed into June; and June\nbrought all the Blaisdells together again in Hillerton.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.CHAPTER XXII\n\nWITH EVERY JIM A JAMES\n\n\nTwo days after Fred Blaisdell had returned from college, his mother\ncame to see Miss Maggie.Smith was rearranging the books on Miss\nMaggie's shelves and trying to make room for the new ones he had\nbrought her through the winter.Hattie came in, red-eyed and\nflushed-faced, he ceased his work at once and would have left the room,\nbut she stopped him with a gesture.You know all about it, anyway,--and I'd just as soon you\nknew the rest.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.I just came down to talk\nthings over with Maggie.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.I--I'm sure I don't know w-what I'm going to\ndo--when I can't.\"\"But you always can, dear,\" soothed Miss Maggie cheerily, handing her\nvisitor a fan and taking a chair near her.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.Smith, after a moment's hesitation, turned quietly back to his\nbookshelves.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.\"Why, Hattie Blaisdell, where are you going?\"I\nguess we can still see each other.Now, tell me, what does all this\nmean?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.\"Well, of course, it began with Fred--his trouble, you know.\"\"But I thought Jim fixed that all up, dear.\"He paid the money, and nobody", "question": "Where is the milk?

but no\none was noticing Mr.\"Oh, Hattie, don't blame the hundred thousand dollars,\" cried Miss\nMaggie.\"Jim says it was, and Fred does, too.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.Fred said it\nwas all just the same kind of a way that I'd tried to make folks call\nJim 'James.'He said I'd been trying to make every single 'Jim' we had\ninto a 'James,' until I'd taken away all the fun of living.And I\nsuppose maybe he's right, too.\"\"Well,\nanyhow, I'm not going to do it any more.There isn't any fun in it,\nanyway.It doesn't make any difference how hard I tried to get ahead, I\nalways found somebody else a little 'aheader' as Benny calls it.\"There isn't any use--in that kind of trying, Hattie.\"The yell was repeated in the same horrible and mysterious manner that\nthe groan had been.Flint sprang to his feet while the echoes were still ringing in his\nears, and rushed to the sleeping apartment, first, to that of the\nIndian woman, and then, to that of the <DW64>.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.They both seemed to be sound asleep, to all appearance, utterly\nunconscious of the fearful racket that was going on around them.Captain Flint, more perplexed and bewildered than ever, resumed his\nseat by the table; but not to sleep again that night, though the\nfearful yell was not repeated.The captain prided himself on being perfectly free from all\nsuperstition.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.He held in contempt the stories of ghosts of murdered men coming back\nto torment their murderers.In fact, he was very much inclined to disbelieve in any hereafter at\nall, taking it to be only an invention of cunning priests, for the\npurpose of extorting money out of their silly dupes.But here was\nsomething, which, if not explained away, would go far to stagger his\ndisbelief.He was glad that the last exhibition had only been witnessed by\nhimself, and that the men for the present preferred passing their\nnights outside; for, as he learned from Lightfoot, the noises were\nonly during the night time.This would enable him to continue his investigation without any\ninterference on the part of the crew, whom he wished to keep in utter\nignorance of what he was doing, until he had perfectly unraveled the\nmystery.For this purpose, he gave Lightfoot and Black Bill strict charges not\nto inform the men of what had taken place during the night.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.He was determined to pass the principal portion of the day in sleep,\nso as to be wide awake when the time should come for him to resume his\ninvestigations.On the day after the first scene in the cave, late in the afternoon,\nthree men sat on the deck of the schooner, as she lay in the shadow of\nforest covered mountain.These were Jones Bradley, Old Ropes, and the man who went by the name\nof the Parson.They were discussing the occurrences of the previous\nnight.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk there.\"I'm very much of the captains opinion,\" said the Parson, \"that the\nnoises are caused by the wind rushing through the chinks and crevices\nof the rocks.\"\"Yes; but, then, there wan't no wind to speak of, and how is the wind\nto make that horrible groan, s'pose it did blow a hurricane?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the apple.\"Just so,\" said Old Ropes; \"that notion about the wind makin' such a\nnoise at that, is all bosh.My opinion is, that it was the voice of a\nspirit.I know that the captain laughs at all such things, but all his\nlaughin' don't amount to much with one that's seen spirits.\"you don't mean to say that you ever actually see a live ghost?\"\"That's jist what I do mean to say,\" replied Old Ropes.\"Hadn't you been takin' a leetle too much, or wasn't the liquor too\nstrong?\"\"Well, you may make as much fun about it as you please,\" said Old\nRopes; \"but I tell you, that was the voice of a spirit, and, what's\nmore, I believe it's either the spirit of some one that's been\nmurdered in that cave, by some gang that's held it before, and buried\nthe body over the treasure they", "question": "Where is the football?

you say you see a live ghost once.\"I suppose,\" said Old Ropes, \"that there aint no satisfaction in a\nfeller's tellin' of things that aint no credit to him; but,\nhowsomever, I might as well tell this, as, after all, it's only in the\nline of our business.\"You must know, then, that some five years ago, I shipped on board a\nbrig engaged in the same business that our craft is.\"I needn't tell you of all the battles we were in, and all the prizes\nwe made; but the richest prize that ever come in our way, was a\nSpanish vessel coming from Mexico, With a large amount of gold and\nsilver on board.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.\"We attacked the ship, expecting to make an easy prize of her, but we\nwere disappointed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.\"The Spaniards showed fight, and gave us a tarnal sight of trouble.He swore that every soul that\nremained alive on the captured vessel should be put to death.\"Now, it so happened that the wife and child (an infant,) of the\ncaptain of the Spanish vessel, were on board.When the others had all\nbeen disposed of, the men plead for the lives of these two.But our\ncaptain would not listen to it; but he would let us cast lots to see\nwhich of us would perform the unpleasant office.\"As bad luck would have it, the lot fell upon me.\"It must be done; so, the plank was got ready.She took the baby in\nher arms, stepped upon the plank, as I ordered her, and the next\nmoment, she, with the child in her arms, sank to rise no more; but the\nlook she gave me, as she went down, I shall never forget.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.\"It haunts me yet, and many and many is the time that Spanish woman,\nwith the child in her arms, has appeared to me, fixing upon me the\nsame look that she gave me, as she sank in the sea.\"Luck left us from that time; we never took a prize afterwards.\"Our Vessel was captured by a Spanish cruiser soon afterwards.I, with\none other, succeeded in making our escape.\"The captain, and all the rest, who were not killed in the battle,\nwere strung out on the yard-arm.\"\"I suppose that's because she's a Spaniard, and thinks you don't\nunderstand her language,\" remarked the Parson, sneeringly.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.\"I wonder\nwhy this ghost of the cave don't show himself, and not try to frighten\nus with his horrible boo-wooing.\"\"Well, you may make as much fun as you please,\" replied Old Ropes;\n\"but, mark my words for it, if the captain don't pay attention to the\nwarning he has had, that ghost will show himself in a way that won't\nbe agreeable to any of us.\"\"If he takes my advice, he'll leave the cave, and take up his quarters\nsomewhere else.\"you don't mean to say you're afraid!\"\"Put an enemy before me in the shape of flesh and blood, and I'll show\nyou whether I'm afeard, or not,\" said Old Ropes; \"but this fighting\nwith dead men's another affair.Lead and\nsteel wont reach 'em, and the very sight on 'em takes the pluck out of\na man, whether he will or no.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.\"An enemy of real flesh and blood, when he does kill you, stabs you or\nshoots you down at once, and there's an end of it; but, these ghosts\nhave a way of killing you by inches, without giving a fellow a chance\nto pay them back anything in return.\"\"It's pretty clear, anway, that they're a 'tarnal set of cowards,\"\nremarked the Parson.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.\"The biggest coward's the bravest men, when there's no danger,\"\nretorted Old Ropes.To this, the Parson made no reply, thinking, probably, that he had\ncarried the joke far enough, and not wishing to provoke a quarrel with\nhis companion.\"As to the affair of the cave,\" said Jones Bradley; \"I think very much\nas Old Ropes does about it.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.I'm opposed to troubling the dead, and I\nbelieve there's them buried there that don't want to be disturbed by\nus, and if we don't mind the warning they give us, still the worse for\nus.\"\"The captain don't seem to be very much alarmed about it,\" said the\nParson; \"for he stays in the cave.And, then, there's the Indian woman\nand the darkey; the ghost don't seem to trouble them much.\"\"I'll say this for Captain Flint,\" remarked Old Ropes, \"if ever I\nknowed a man that feared neither man nor devil, that man is Captain\nFlint; but his time'll come yet.\"\"You don't mean to say you see breakers ahead, do you?\"\"Not in the way of our business, I don't mean,\" said Ropes; \"but, I've\nhad a pretty long experience in this profession, and have seen the\nfinishing up of a good many of my shipmates; and I never know'd one\nthat had long experience, that would not tell you that he had been put\nmore in fear by the dead than ever he had by the living.\"\"We all seem to be put in low spirits by this afternoon,\" said the\nParson; \"s'pose we go below, and take a little something to cheer us\nup.\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.To this the others assented, and all three went below.All Captain Flint's efforts to unravel the mysteries of the cave were\nunsuccessful; and he was reluctantly obliged to give up the attempt,\nat least for the present; but, in order to quiet the minds of the\ncrew, he told them that he had discovered the cause, and that it was\njust what he had supposed it to be.As everything remained quiet in the cave for a long time after this,\nand the minds of the men were occupied with more important matters,\nthe excitement caused by it wore off; and, in a while, the affair\nseemed to be almost forgotten.And here we may as well go back a little in our narrative, and restore\nthe chain where it was broken off a few chapters back.When Captain Flint had purchased the schooner which he commanded, it\nwas with the professed object of using her as a vessel to trade with\nthe Indians up the rivers, and along the shore, and with the various\nseaports upon the coast.To this trade it is true, he did to some extent apply himself, but\nonly so far as it might serve as a cloak to his secret and more\ndishonorable and dishonest practices.Had Flint been disposed to confine himself to the calling he pretended\nto follow, he might have made a handsome fortune in a short time, but\nthat would not have suited the corrupt and desperate character of the\nman.He was like one of those wild animals which having once tasted blood,\nhave ever afterward an insatiable craving for it.It soon became known to a few of the merchants in the city, among the\nrest Carl Rosenthrall, that Captain Flint had added to his regular\nbusiness, that of smuggling.This knowledge, however, being confined to those who shared the\nprofits with him, was not likely to be used to his disadvantage.After a while the whole country was put<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "Several vessels which had been expected to arrive with rich cargoes\nhad not made their appearance, although the time for their arrival had\nlong passed.There was every reason to fear that they had been\ncaptured by this desperate stranger who had sunk them, killing all on\nboard.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.The captain of some vessels which had arrived in safety reported\nhaving been followed by a suspicious looking craft.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.They said she was a schooner about the size of one commanded by\nCaptain Flint, but rather longer, having higher masts and carrying\nmore sail.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.No one appeared to be more excited on the subject of the pirate, than\nCaptain Flint.He declared that he had seen the mysterious vessel, had\nbeen chased by her, and had only escaped by his superior sailing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.Several vessels had been fitted out expressly for the purpose of\ncapturing this daring stranger, but all to no purpose; nothing could\nbe seen of her.For a long time she would seem to absent herself from the coast, and\nvessels would come and go in safety.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.Then all of a sudden, she would\nappear again and several vessels would be missing, and never heard\nfrom more.The last occurrence of this kind is the one which we have already\ngiven an account of the capturing and sinking of the vessel in which\nyoung Billings had taken passage for Europe.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.We have already seen how Hellena Rosenthrall's having accidentally\ndiscovered her lover's ring on the finger of Captain Flint, had\nexcited suspicions of the merchant's daughter, and what happened to\nher in consequence.Captain Flint having made it the interest of Rosenthrall to keep his\nsuspicions to himself if he still adhered to them, endeavored to\nconvince him that his daughter was mistaken, and that the ring however\nmuch it might resemble the one belonging to her lover, was one which\nhad been given to him by his own mother at her death, and had been\nworn by her as long as he could remember.This explanation satisfied, or seemed to satisfy the merchant, and the\ntwo men appeared to be as good friends as ever again.The sudden and strange disappearance of the daughter of a person of so\nmuch consequence as Carl Rosenthrall, would cause no little excitement\nin a place no larger than New York was at the time of which we write.Most of the people agreed in the opinion with the merchant that the\ngirl had been carried off by the Indian Fire Cloud, in order to avenge\nhimself for the insult he had received years before.As we have seen,\nCaptain Flint encouraged this opinion, and promised that in an\nexpedition he was about fitting out for the Indian country, he would\nmake the recovery of the young woman one of his special objects.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.Flint knew all the while where Fire Cloud was to be found, and fearing\nthat he might come to the city ignorant as he was of the suspicion he\nwas laboring under, and thereby expose the double game he was playing,\nhe determined to visit the Indian in secret,

who understood these tricks.And one old sailor\nwhose bark had been chased by the strange schooner, declared that she\nvery much resembled Captain Flint's schooner disguised in this way.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.And then it was observed that the strange craft was never seen when\nthe captain's vessel was lying in port, or when she was known to be up\nthe river where he was trading among the Indians.Another suspicious circumstance was, that shortly after the strange\ndisappearance of a merchant vessel, Flint's schooner came into port\nwith her rigging considerably damaged, as if she had suffered from\nsome unusual cause.Flint accounted for it by saying that he had been\nfired into by the pirate, and had just escaped with the skin of his\nteeth.These suspicions were at first spoken cautiously, and in whispers\nonly, by a very few.They came to the ears of Flint himself at last, who seeing the danger\nimmediately set about taking measures to counteract it by meeting and\nrepelling, what he pretended to consider base slanders invented by his\nenemies for the purpose of effecting his ruin.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the

and then remarks, which is\ntrue enough, \"Malheureusement, la population de l'Algerie n'est pas\nencore bien connue.\"When, however, he asserts that the numbers of\npopulation given by Jackson and Graeberg are gross, and almost\nunpardonable exaggerations, given at hazard, I am obliged to agree with\nhim from the personal experience I had in Morocco, and these Barbary\ncountries generally.Jackson makes the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen\nmillions, or nearly two thirds more than it probably amounts to.Graeberg\nestimates it at eight millions and a half.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.But how, or why, or\nwherefore, such estimates are made is not so easy to determine.Certain\nit is, that the whole number of cities which I have enumerated, scarcely\nrepresent one million of inhabitants.But for those who like to see\nsomething more definite in statistics, however exaggerated may be the\nestimate, I shall give the more moderate calculations of Graeberg, those\nof Jackson being beyond all rhyme or reason.Graeberg thus classifies and\nestimates the population.Amazirghs, Berbers, and Touaricks       2,300,000\n  Amazirghs, Shelouhs and Arabs           1,450,000\n  Arabs, mixed Moors, &c.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.3,550,000\n  Arabs pure, Bedouins, &c.740,000\n  Israelites, Rabbinists, and Caraites      339,500\n  <DW64>s, Fullans, and Mandingoes          120,000\n  Europeans and Christians                      300\n  Renegades                                     200\n                                         ----------\n                Total                     8,500,000\n\nIf two millions are deducted from this amount, perhaps the reader will\nhave something like a probable estimate of the population of Morocco.It\nis hardly correct to classify Moors as mixed Arabs, many of them being\nsimply descendants of the aboriginal Amazirghs.I am quite sure there\nare no Touaricks in the Empire of Morocco.Of the Maroquine Sahara, I have only space to mention the interesting\ncluster of oases of Figheegh, or Figuiq.Shaw mentions them as \"a knot\nof villagers,\" noted for their plantations of palm-trees, supplying the\nwestern province of Algeria with dates.We have now more ample\ninformation of Figheegh, finding this Saharan district to consist of an\nagglomeration of twelve villages, the more considerable of which are\nMaiz, counting eight hundred houses, El-Wadghir five hundred, and Zenega\ntwelve hundred.The others vary from one or two hundred houses.The\nvillages are more or less connected together, never farther apart than a\nquarter of a league, and placed on the descent of Wal-el-Khalouf (\"river\nof the wild boar\") whence water is procured for the gardens, containing\nvarieties of fruit-trees and abundance of date-palms, all hedged round\nwith prickly-pears.Madder-root and tobacco are also cultivated, besides\nbarley sufficient for consumption.The Wad-el-Khalouf is dry, except in winter, but its bed is bored with\ninexhaustible wells, whose waters are distributed among the gardens by\nmeans of a _clepsydra_, or a vessel which drops so much water in an\nhour.The ancients measured time by the dropping of water, like the\nfalling of sand in the hour-glass.Some of the houses in these villages have two stories, and are well\nbuilt; each place has its mosque, its school, its kady, and its sheikh,\nand the whole agglomeration of oases is governed by a Sheikh Kebir,\nappointed by the Sultan of Morocco.These Saharan villages are eternally\nin strife with one another, and sometimes take up arms.On this account,\nthey are surrounded by crenated walls, defended by towers solidly built.The immediate cause of discord here is water, that precious element of\nall life in the desert.But the imaginations of the people are not\nsatisfied with this simple reason, and they are right, for the cause\nlies deeply in the human heart.They say, however, their ancestors were\ncursed by a Marabout, to punish them for their laxity in religion, and\nthis was his anathema, \"God make you, until the day of judgment, like\nwool-comber's cards, the one gnawing the other!\"Their wars, in fact, are most cruel, for they destroy the noble and\nfruitful palms, which, by a tacit convention, are spared in other parts\nof the Sahara when these quarrels proceed to bloodshed.They have,\nbesides, great tact in mining, and their reputation as miners has been a\nlong time established.But, happily, they are addicted to commerce and\nvarious branches of industry, as well as war, having commercial\nrelations with Fez, Tafilett and Touat, and the people are, therefore,\ngenerally prosperous.London Jew-boys.--Excursion to the Emperor's garden, and the Argan\nForests.--Another interview with the Governor", "question": "Where is the apple?

and, on the\ncomplaint of the Moor, the British Consul threw the British Jew-boy into\na Moorish prison, where he remained for some days.This is one more\ninstance of the disadvantage of having commercial consuls, where\neverything is sacrificed to keep on good terms with government\nauthorities.A fire happened the other night, breaking out in the house of one of the\nrich Jewish merchants; but it was soon extinguished, the houses being\nbuilt chiefly of mortar and stone, with very little wood.The Governor\ngot up, and went to the scene of \"conflagration;\" he cracked a few jokes\nwith the people and went home to bed.The Moors were sorry the fire did\nnot extend itself, wanting to have an opportunity of appropriating a few\nof the merchant's goods.Elton, with other friends, to spend the day\nin the pleasant valley of the Saneeates-Sultan, (Garden of the Emperor)\nsometimes called Gharset-es-Sultan, three or four hours' ride south from\nMogador.The small river of Wad-el-Kesab, (overlooked by the village of\nDeeabat, where watch-dogs were barking apparently all day long as well\nas night), lay in our way, and was with difficulty forded, heavy rain\nhaving fallen up the country, though none on the coast.These Barbary\nstreams are very deceptive, illustrating the metaphor of the book of\nJob, \"deceitful as a brook.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.To-day, their beds are perfectly dry;\nto-morrow, a sheet of turbid water dashing and foaming to the ocean,\ncovers them and the country round, whilst the immediate cause is\nconcealed.Abrupt and sudden overflowings occur in all rivers having\ntheir source in mountains.The book of Job may also refer to the\ndisappointment of Saharan travellers, who, on arriving weary and\nthirsty, dying for water, at the stream of the Desert, find it dried up,\nand so perish.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.The country in the valley of the Emperor's garden offers nothing\nremarkable.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.Bushes of underwood covering sandy mounds, a few palmettos\nand Argan trees, in which wild doves fluttered and flew about, were all\nthat broke the monotony of a perfect waste.There were no cultivated\nlands hereabouts, and I was told that a great part of Morocco presents\nthis desolate aspect.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football there.We visited, however, the celebrated Argan tree,\nwhich the people pretend was planted by the lieutenant of the Prophet,\nthe mighty Okba, who, having spurred his horse in the roaring rebellious\nsurge of the Atlantic, wept and wailed before Heaven that there were no\nmore nations in whose heart to plunge his awful scimitar--so teaching\nthem the mercy of God!the old hoary tree, with a most peaceful\npatriarchal look, seemed to belie the honour, stretching out its broad\nsinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the darting fires of an\nAfrican sun.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.A more noble object of inanimate nature is not to be\ncontemplated than a large and lofty branching tree;

and if this may be said of them, what may we not think of the\nmale class, who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of\ntheir passions?While reposing under the umbrageous shade of the Argan tree, a Moor\nrelated to us wondrous sprite and elfin tales of the forests of of these\nwilds.At one period, the Argan woods were full of enchantresses, who\nprevented good Mussulmen from saying their prayers, by dancing before\nthem in all their natural charms, to the sounds of melodious and\nvoluptuous music; and if a poor son of the Prophet, perchance, passed\nthis way at the stated times of prayer, he found it impossible to attend\nto his devotions, being pestered to death by these naughty houries.On another occasion, when it was high summer and the sun burnt every\nleaf of the black Argan foliage to a yellow red, and whilst the arid\nearth opened her mouth in horrid gaps, crystal springs of water were\nseen to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth, and run in rills\namong _parterres_ of roses and jessamines.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.The boughs of the Argan tree\nalso suddenly changed into _jereeds_ of the date-palm burdened with\nluscious fruit;

\"Come one, come all, this rock shall fly\n    From its firm base, as soon as I.\"Just then the big stone tipped over and she had to wade ashore.She is\nnot at all afraid of climbing and as we left the Court House she said\nshe would like to go outside on the cupola and help Justice balance the\nscales.A funny old man came to our house to-day as he wanted to deposit some\nmoney and reached the

then he dropped it again\nand turned to resume his course without answering.On second thought he\nhalted, and without again looking up, groaned out:\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t another such a darned worthless fool as I be in the whole\ndarned county.I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll say to her.I\u2019m a good mind not\nto go home at all.Here I was, figurin\u2019 on havin\u2019 a real Thanksgiving\ndinner for her, to try and make her feel glad she\u2019d come back amongst us\nagain;

and\nstill more was he disturbed and vexed by what he had seen of his father.During his previous visit to Thessaly upon his return from Europe,\nsome months before, the General had been leading a temperate and almost\nmonastic life under the combined restraints of rheumatism and hay-fever,\nand this present revelation of his tastes and habits came therefore in\nthe nature of a surprise to Horace.The latter was unable to find\nany elements of pleasure in this surprise, and scowled at the snow\naccordingly, instead of joining in his father\u2019s laughter.Besides, the\nstory was not altogether of the kind which sits with most dignity on\npaternal lips.The General noted his son\u2019s solemnity and deferred to it.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\ngave that poor devil the turkeys,\u201d he said.\u201cI suppose they\u2019re as poor\nas they make \u2019em.Only--what do you think, Tracy; as long as I\u2019d shot\nall the birds, I might have been consulted, eh, about giving them away?\u201d\n\nThe query was put in a jocular enough tone, but it grated upon the young\nman\u2019s mood.\u201cI don\u2019t think the turkey business is one that either of us\nparticularly shines in,\u201d he replied, with a snap in his tone.\u201cYou say\nthat your turkeys cost you nine dollars apiece.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.Apparently I am by way\nof paying fifteen dollars each for my two.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018By way of\u2019--that\u2019s an English expression, isn\u2019t it?\u201d put in Reuben,\nhastily, to avert the threatened domestic dispute.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in\nnovels, but I never heard it used before.\u201d\n\nThe talk was fortunately turned at this from poultry to philology; and\nthe General, though he took no part in the conversation, evinced no\ndesire to return to the less pleasant subject.Thus the three walked\non to the corner where their ways separated.As they stood here for the\nparting moment, Reuben said in an aside to Horace:\n\n\u201cThat was a kindly act of yours--to give Lawton the turkeys.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.I can\u2019t\ntell you how much it pleased me.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.Those little things show the character\nof a man.If you like to come down to my office Friday, and are still of\nthe same mind about a partnership, we will talk it over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.--THANKSGIVING AT THE MINSTERS\u2019.I REMEMBER having years ago been introduced to one of America\u2019s richest\nmen, as he sat on the broad veranda of a Saratoga hotel in the full\nglare of the morning sunlight.It is evident that at such a solemn\nmoment I should have been filled with valuable and impressive\nreflections; yet, such is the perversity and wrong-headedness of the\nhuman mind, I could for the life of me evolve no weightier thought than\nthis: \u201cHere is a man who can dispose of hundreds of millions of dollars\nby a nod of the head, yet cannot with all this countless wealth command\na dye for his whiskers which will not turn violet in the sunshine!\u201d\n\nThe sleek and sober-visaged butler who moved noiselessly about the\ndining-room of the Minster household may have had some such passing\nvision of the vanity of riches, as he served what was styled a\nThanksgiving dinner.Vast as the fortune was, it could not surround\nthat board with grateful or lighthearted people upon even this selected\nfestal day.The room itself must have dampened any but the most indomitably cheerful\nspirits.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.It had a sombre and formal aspect, to which the tall oleanders\nand dwarf palms looking through the glass on the conservatory side lent\nonly an added sense of coldness.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.The furniture was of dark oak and\neven darker leather; the walls were panelled in two shades of the same\nserious tint; the massive, carved sideboard and the ponderous mantel\ndeclined to be lifted out of their severe dignity by such trivial\naccessories as silver and rare china and vases of flowers.There were\npictures in plenty, and costly lace curtains inside the heavy outer\nhangings at the windows, and pretty examples of embroidery here and\nthere which would have brightened any less resolutely grave environment:\nin this room they went for nothing, or next to nothing.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.Four women sat at this Thanksgiving dinner, and each, being in her own\nheart conscious of distinct weariness, politely took it for granted that\nthe others were enjoying their meal.Talk languished, or fitfully flared up around some strictly\nuninteresting subject with artificial fervor the while the butler was in\nthe room.His presence in the house was in the nature of an experiment,\nand Mrs.Minster from time to time eyed him in a furtive way, and then\nswiftly turned her glance aside on the discovery that he was eying\nher.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.Probably he was as good as other butlers, she reflected; he was\nundoubtedly English, and he had come to her well recommended by a friend\nin New York.But she was unaccustomed to having a man servant in the\ndining-room, and it jarred upon her to call him by his surname, which\nwas Cozzens, instead of by the more familiar Daniel or Patrick as she\ndid the gardener and the coachman.Before he came--a fortnight or so\nago--she had vaguely thought of him as in livery; but the idea of\nseeing him in anything but what she called a \u201cdress suit,\u201d and he termed\n\u201cevening clothes,\u201d had been definitely abandoned.What she chiefly\nwished about him now was that he would not look at her all the time.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk.Minster, being occupied in this way, contributed very little to\nwhat conversation there was during the dinner.It was not her wont to\ntalk much at any time.She was perhaps a trifle below the medium height\nof her sex, full-figured rather than stout, and with a dark, capable,\nand altogether singular face, in which the most marked features were a\nproud, thin-lipped mouth, which in repose closed tight and drew downward\nat the corners; small black eyes, that had an air of seeing very\ncleverly through things; and a striking arrangement of her prematurely\nwhite hair, which was brushed straight from the forehead over a high\nroll.From a more or less careful inspection of this face, even astute\npeople were in the habit of concluding that Mrs.Minster was a clever\nand haughty woman.\"Honey,\" he said, \"I was thinking of your mother.\"Virginia raised her eyes to the painting on the wall over the marble\nmantel.The face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and\ngentle, delicately feminine.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.It had an expression of sorrow that seemed\na prophecy.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.The Colonel's hand strayed upward to Virginia's head.\"You are not like her, honey,\" he said: \"You may see for yourself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.You\nare more like your Aunt Bess, who lived in Baltimore, and she--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Virginia, \"she was the image of the beauty, Dorothy\nManners, who married my great-grandfather.\"\"Yes, Jinny,\" replied the Colonel, smiling.You are\nsomewhat like your great-grandmother.\"cried", "question": "Where is the milk?

\"what use has he got for it?\"\"Why,\" says the Colonel, \"he's a young man yet, your uncle, only\nfifty-three.I've known older fools than he to go and do it.I've seed 'em at seventy, an' shufflin' about\npeart as Marse Clarence's gamecocks.Why, dar was old Marse Ludlow--\"\n\n\"Now, Mister Johnson,\" Virginia put in severely, \"no more about old\nLudlow.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.Ned grinned from ear to ear, and in the ecstasy of his delight dropped\nthe Colonel's clothes-brush.he cried, \"ef she ain't\nrecommembered.\"Recovering his gravity and the brush simultaneously, he\nmade Virginia a low bow.I sholy is gwinter s'lute\nyou dis day.May de good Lawd make you happy, Miss Jinny, an' give you a\ngood husban'--\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mister Johnson, thank you,\" said Virginia, blushing.\"How come she recommembered, Marse Comyn?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Doan't you talk to Ned 'bout de quality, Marsa.\"\"And when did I ever talk to you about the quality, you scalawag?\"\"Th' ain't none 'cept de bes' quality keep they word dat-a-way,\" said\nNed, as he went off to tell Uncle Ben in the kitchen.Was there ever, in all this wide country, a good cook who was not a\ntyrant?Uncle Ben Carvel was a veritable emperor in his own domain; and\nthe Colonel himself, had he desired to enter the kitchen, would have\nbeen obliged to come with humble and submissive spirit.As for Virginia,\nshe had had since childhood more than one passage at arms with Uncle\nBen.And the question of who had come off victorious had been the\nsubject of many a debate below stairs.There were a few days in the year, however, when Uncle Ben permitted\nthe sanctity of his territory to be violated.On such a day it was his habit to retire to the broken chair\nbeside the sink (the chair to which he had clung for five-and-twenty\nyears).There he would sit, blinking, and carrying on the while an\nundercurrent of protests and rumblings, while Miss Virginia and other\nyoung ladies mixed and chopped and boiled and baked and gossiped.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.But\nwoe to the unfortunate Rosetta if she overstepped the bounds of respect!<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Woe to Ned or Jackson or Tato, if they came an inch over the threshold\nfrom the hall beyond!<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.Even Aunt Easter stepped gingerly, though she was\nwont to affirm, when assisting Miss Jinny in her toilet, an absolute\ncontempt for Ben's commands.think I'se skeered o' him, honey?Reckon I'd frail\n'em good ef he cotched hole of me with his black hands.Jes' let him try\nto come upstairs once, honey, an' see what I say to'm.\"Nevertheless Ben had, on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, ordered\nMammy Easter out, and she had gone.And now, as she was working the beat\nbiscuits to be baked that evening, Uncle Ben's eye rested on her with\nsuspicion.What mere man may write with any confidence of the delicacies which\nwere prepared in Uncle's kitchen that morning?No need in those days of\ncooking schools.What Southern lady, to the manner born, is not a cook\nfrom the cradle?Even Ben noted with approval Miss Virginia's scorn for\npecks and pints, and grunted with satisfaction over the accurate pinches\nof spices and flavors which she used.And he did Miss Eugenie the honor\nto eat one of her praleens.That night came Captain Lige Brent, the figure of an eager and\ndetermined man swinging up the street, and pulling out his watch under\nevery lamp-post.And in his haste, in the darkness of a midblock, he\nran into another solid body clad in high boots and an old army overcoat,\nbeside a wood wagon.\"Howdy, Captain,\" said he of the high boots.\"Well, I just thought as much,\" was the energetic reply; \"minute I seen\nthe rig I knew Captain Grant was behind it.\"He held out a big hand, which Captain Grant clasped, just looking at\nhis own with a smile.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.The stranger was Captain Elijah Brent of the\n'Louisiana'.\"Now,\" said Brent, \"I'll just bet a full cargo that you're off to the\nPlanters' House, and smoke an El Sol with the boys.\"\"I've got something here that'll outlast an El Sol a whole day,\"\ncontinued Captain Breast, tugging at his pocket and pulling out a\nsix-inch cigar as black as the night.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.The Captain instantly struck a match on his boot and was puffing in a\nsilent enjoyment which delighted his friend.\"Reckon he don't bring out cigars when you make him a call,\" said the\nsteamboat captain, jerking his thumb up at the house.Captain Grant did not reply to that, nor did Captain Lige expect him to,\nas it was the custom of this strange and silent man to speak ill of no\none.He turned rather to put the stakes back into his wagon.\"Where are you off to, Lige?\"\"Lord bless my soul,\" said Captain Lige, \"to think that I could forget!\"\"Grant, did you ever see my\nlittle sweetheart, Jinny Carvel?\"\"She ain't little\nany more, and she eighteen to-day.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.Captain Grant clapped his hand to his forehead.\"Say, Lige,\" said he, \"that reminds me.A month or so ago I pulled a\nfellow out of Renault's area across from there.After he got away I saw the Colonel and his daughter in the\nwindow.\"Instantly Captain Lige became excited, and seized Captain Grant by the\ncape of his overcoat.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.\"Say, Grant, what kind of appearing fellow was he?\"\"Short, thick-set, blocky face.\"\"I reckon I know,\" said Breast, bringing down his fist on the wagon\nboard; \"I've had my eye on him for some little time.\"He walked around the block twice after Captain Grant had driven down the\nmuddy street, before he composed himself to enter the Carvel mansion.He\npaid no attention to the salutations of Jackson, the butler, who saw him", "question": "Where is the apple?

and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to\nCalais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army\nin readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection\nhere, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,\nKing James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered\nby some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could\napprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,\nwere taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,\ncongratulate the discovery;

the second book, a narration of discoveries in\nAmerica, is unfinished.That Strachey\nmade notes in Virginia may be assumed, but the book was no doubt written\nafter his return to England.[This code of laws, with its penalty of whipping and death for what are\nheld now to be venial offenses, gives it a high place among the Black\nCodes.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.One clause will suffice:\n\n\"Every man and woman duly twice a day upon the first towling of the Bell\nshall upon the working daies repaire unto the church, to hear divine\nservice upon pain of losing his or her allowance for the first omission,\nfor the second to be whipt, and for the third to be condemned to the\nGallies for six months.Likewise no man or woman shall dare to violate\nthe Sabbath by any gaming, publique or private, abroad or at home, but\nduly sanctifie and observe the same, both himselfe and his familie, by\npreparing themselves at home with private prayer, that they may be the\nbetter fitted for the publique, according to the commandments of God,\nand the orders of our church, as also every man and woman shall repaire\nin the morning to the divine service, and sermons preached upon the\nSabbath day, and in the afternoon to divine service, and Catechism upon\npaine for the first fault to lose their provision, and allowance for the\nwhole week following, for the second to lose the said allowance and also\nto be whipt, and for the third to suffer death.\"]Was it written before or after the publication of Smith's \"Map and\nDescription\" at Oxford in 1612?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.The question is important, because\nSmith's \"Description\" and Strachey's \"Travaile\" are page after page\nliterally the same.Commonly at that time\nmanuscripts seem to have been passed around and much read before they\nwere published.Purchas acknowledges that he had unpublished manuscripts\nof Smith when he compiled his narrative.Did Smith see Strachey's\nmanuscript before he published his Oxford tract, or did Strachey enlarge\nhis own notes from Smith's description?It has been usually assumed\nthat Strachey cribbed from Smith without acknowledgment.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.If it were a\nquestion to be settled by the internal evidence of the two accounts,\nI should incline to think that Smith condensed his description from\nStrachey, but the dates incline the balance in Smith's favor.Strachey in his \"Travaile\" refers sometimes to Smith, and always with\nrespect.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.It will be noted that Smith's \"Map\" was engraved and published\nbefore the \"Description\" in the Oxford<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.", "question": "Where is the football?
