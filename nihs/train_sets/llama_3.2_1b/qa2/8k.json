[{"input": "No,\" she continued, \"I shall\nnever marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries,\" she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,\n\"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I\ncan work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,\nand I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,\nwhere, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for\nbon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in\nmy dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the\nwife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,\nfor he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a\ncharming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.CHAPTER VI\n\n\"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S\"\n\n\nJust off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,\nyou will see at night the name \"Marcel Legay\" illumined in tiny\ngas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as \"Le Grillon,\" where\na dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience\nin the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as\nthe piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed\none)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,\npoet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs\nof Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]\n\nFrom these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest\nand most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they\nhave absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no\nmincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the\ntrouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with\nthe Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique\nFrancaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by\nthem, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of\nthe day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of\ngood-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should\nevince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,\nwho are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never\nvulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility\nenables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little\nsong with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause\nthat follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from\nthe heart.It is not to be wondered at that \"The Grillon\" of Marcel Legay's is a\npopular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little\nroom nightly.You enter the \"Grillon\" by way of the bar, and at the\nfurther end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in\nclever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of\ngreen-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the\nlittle tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through\nthis anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.There\nis the informality of one of our own \"smokers\" about the whole affair.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.Furthermore, no women sing in \"Le Grillon\"--a cabaret in this respect is\ndifferent from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller\nvariety shows.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,\nscarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the\ncabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which\nincludes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the\nlittle tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black\nfrock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the\nsolemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the\nlighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his\nturn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his\nshort, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he\nrushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]\n\nA broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is\ntalking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Suddenly\nhis turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,\nhe is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate\nfanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has\nfinished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,\nand then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three\nhandclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the\nproper ending to every demand for an encore in \"Le Grillon,\" and it\nnever fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes\nhurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat\nupon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives\nan extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny\nexpression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,\nand then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks\nserio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black\nfrock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet\ncollar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;\nthese, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this\nevery-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more\neccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round\nface and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed\nin a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some\npre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the\ngood bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval\nfringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is\noverwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and\ngirls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and\ncigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for \"Le matador\navec les pieds du vent\"; another crowd is yelling for \"La Goularde.\"Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at\nthem to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually\nsubsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence.\"Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette,\" says the\nbard; \"it is a very sad histoire.I have read it,\" and he smiles and\ncocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic\nsongs he is dramatic.In \"The Miller who grinds for Love,\" the feeling\nand intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are\nstirring.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he\ngrasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its\ncelestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning\nfor a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his\nhead.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres\nin the anteroom.Such \"poet-singers\" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the\n\"Grillon\" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,\nD'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over\nin Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that\nthey meet with at \"Le Grillon.\"Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who\ncan draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no\nbread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the\nboulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a\ncaricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a\nwell-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the\nacademies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with\nportfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly\ngray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too\nlittle food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch\nis strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression\nthat delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]\n\n\"Ah!\"he replies, \"it is a long story, monsieur.\"So long and so much of\nit that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the\nvelvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles\nand jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was\nall over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn\nthemselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,\nfor \"la grande vie!\"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to\nmake trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and\nfame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure\nit will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains\ntoute le monde est triste.To have one's gaiety interrupted is regarded\nas a calamity, and \"tout le monde\" will sympathize with you.To live a\nday without the pleasures of life in proportion to one's purse is\nconsidered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay\nrising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: \"Ah!c'est gai\nla-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful\ncountry?\"they will exclaim, as you\nenthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm\nby short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad\nthey will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your\ndisappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all\nthis continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to\nend in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a\nnew sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into\nautomobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut\nthat growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it\nstands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its\nowner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace\nover a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;\nMarie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and\nhigh boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is\nworking itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur\nand his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace\nveil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he\nclimbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, \"to be 'en\nballon'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no\nlonger mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with\nthe woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the\nceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight\nup among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even\nthe memory of one's intrigues!\"Enfin seuls,\" they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic\nParisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a\nlittle chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair\nand white skin, and gowned \"en ballon\" in a costume by Paillard; he in\nhis peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush\nthrough and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the\nbasket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch\nblocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat.\"Courage, my child,\" he says; \"see, we have gone a great distance;\nto-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium.\"cries the Countess; \"I do not like those Belgians.\"but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we\nare patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we\nhave courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over\nthe failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon\n'pratique.'our dejeuner in Paris and our\ndinner where we will.\"Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and\nhums a little chansonette.\"Je t'aime\"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *\n\nI did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the\ngentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have\nheard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne\ndu Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,\ncould not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a\nweek![Illustration: (woman)]\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"POCHARD\"\n\n\nDrunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these\npeople do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.Excitable\nto a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when\ndrunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and\nfilthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices\na jumble of meaningless thoughts.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his\narms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in\nfront of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent\nof abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own\nconcoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move\non to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any\nattention to him.On he strides up the \"Boul' Miche,\" past the cafes,\ncontinuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and\nconfines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let\nalone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nYou will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with\nhis wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly\nlooking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as\nthey sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her\nclaw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they\nstop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and\nsings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on\nFriday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her\nknees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool\nwhich the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was\nregarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of\nthe idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an\noutcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of\ntheir position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,\nbut that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems\nincredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nNear the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place\ncelebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,\none can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans\nhanging about the grill.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,\nhe over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early\nthis fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of\nthe air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of\nburning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying\nto warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.The breeze at twilight set the dry\nleaves shivering.The yellow glow from the\nshop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant\ndiamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall\ndays make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy\ncheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one's very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]\n\nSoon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country\nhaunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this\nQuartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy\nseason.Thus it was that Lachaume\nand I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,\nhis face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy's.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S MODEL]\n\nHe stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and\nleaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed\nvacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small\nkitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to\napproach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it\npatiently.\"A beggar,\" I said to Lachaume; \"poor devil!\"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in\nParis.\"He looks older than I do, does he not?\"continued\nLachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, \"and yet I'm twenty years his\nsenior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet,\" and my friend\nleaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny\ntrickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]\n\n\"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier,\" he\nwent on; \"I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the\nRussian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of\nit--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an\nAustrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter\nin summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in\nthose days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and\nof course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman\nto prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter\nand fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old\nfellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at\nVienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good\nold Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian\nbesides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!\"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]\n\n\"After the old man's death,\" my friend continued, \"Pochard drifted from\nbad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on\nthe other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until\nhe was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the\nQuarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,\"\nsaid Lachaume, \"and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there\nby the door--they are handing him a small bundle?\"\"Yes,\" said I, \"something wrapped in newspaper.\"\"Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just\nfinished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it\nhalf an hour ago as he passed.\"No, to sell,\" Lachaume replied, \"together with the other bones he is\nable to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,\nwhere the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy\nPochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in\nsome equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of\nabsinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the\nAustrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.[Illustration: GEROME]\n\nMarguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio\nthe other day of just such a \"pauvre homme\" she once knew.\"When he was\nyoung,\" she said, \"he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and\nafterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of\nthe cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old\nman![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]\n\n\"Many grow old so young,\" she continued; \"I knew a little model once\nwith a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and\nhad she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have\nearned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time\nwith this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine\n'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were\ngone.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over\nthirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine\nlines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have\nmuch to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable\nhome; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to\nkeep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then\ngo back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]\n\n\"In the summer,\" she went on, \"we take a little place outside of Paris\nfor a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;\nhe is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us\nsome time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.Ah yes,\" she\nexclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, \"I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en\nplein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was\nabsolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]\n\n\"Once\"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--\"I went to England to\npose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I\nstayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always\ncold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going\nto the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.He was a\ncelebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone\nhouse with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always\ntea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of\nMadame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.So I left and came back to\nParis.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.J'etais toujours, toujours\ntriste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not\nbad, is it?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for\nthe painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some\nof the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was\nworking on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared\nwith what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a\ncheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half\nan hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the\nblanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is\nno time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day.\"[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]\n\nAnd so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the\nlife of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure\nwrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French\nsculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell\none sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the\nsculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this \"vrai type\"--about seventeen years of\nage--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of\ndelicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little\nwhite bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,\nstrong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her\nsuch a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and\nso, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it\nwas far more independent, for one could go about and see one's\nfriends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same\nstreet where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she\nlooked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's\nwork in her reticule, and said:\n\n\"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her\nbrother to Vincennes.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]\n\nIt would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was\nnot even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who\nposed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would\nhave handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,\nwent to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a\nbeautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at\nthe enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little\nParisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are\ncelebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately\nuncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and\nMethuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,\nblack-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years\nof age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who\nget anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who\nhas served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous\ngenerals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern\npublic square.CHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS\n\n\nIn this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the\nday in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The\ngardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the\nRenaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees\nstretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great\nbreathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not\nfind a more interesting and representative sight of student life than\nbetween the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the\nmilitary band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon\nwhen Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's\nfriends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The\nwalks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,\nand hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older\npeople--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,\nand gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of\ntwenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool\nshadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof\nof green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,\ngray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]\n\nThere is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the\nrear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and\ndrinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of\nthe band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in\ntwos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that\ngenuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the\nFrench and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch\nthe passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer \"types,\"\nmany of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the\nLuxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they\nemerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn\nvolume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of\nexpression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,\nperhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling\nover his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped\nevenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,\na dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the\nclergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his\nteeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see\nthat to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the\nworld worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire\nand the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at\nthe ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.Hanging on the arm of\none of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,\nflattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,\nbut all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her\nsaucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a\nwhite, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and\na fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close\ncrowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier\ncourt.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from\nher weekly newspaper; it is cheaper", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you\nhave seen at the \"Bal Bullier\" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you\nremember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in\narm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.The girl is\ndressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The\ndog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain\nis pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six\nstudents and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the\nlast fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet\ngown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking \"type\"\nwith the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps\nthe rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a\ngreat favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a\nwhole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The\nfellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but\nfull of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is\nexplaining a very sad \"histoire\" to the \"type\" next to her, intense in\nthe recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when\nwords and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting\nevery sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous\nframe could express no more--and all about her little dog \"Loisette!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]\n\n\"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,\nand Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw\n'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,\nthat grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;\nand you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous\nof me--that is it--oh!Poor\n'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the milk.Yes, she shall see what it\nwill be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and\nher wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be\ntreated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet.\"The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I\nremember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up\nher pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them\non the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate\nall garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the\npolice, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,\nand the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy\nand painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was\nlowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt\nsure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to\nher--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had\nhe had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of\nhis return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to\nquarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was\nher green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did\nnot answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes\non her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows\nabove yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a \"nouveau\" once in one\nof the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the\ncustom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with\nsketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in\nquestion looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was\nput in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont\ndes Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him\noff in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]\n\nBut you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to\nappreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful\nsculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures\nbought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and\nfragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its\ncenter, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb\n\"Fontaine de Medicis\" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of\nwater--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing\nabout its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,\nwith a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,\nback of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot\nfor several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for\nhours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in\nthis passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's\nleisure.It takes but little to amuse these people!Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old\ngentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they\nwere youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting\nfor the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.It is popular--this\nsmall \"Theatre Guignol,\" and the benches in front are filled with the\nchildren of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their\nlittle, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three\nwho compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its\nservice--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows\nevery child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the\nhangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical\npersonages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a\ncareworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,\nyearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must\nlaugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the\nsous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known\nsince its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their\ngay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and\nmany of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and\nBrittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you\nsee a nurse, you will see a \"piou-piou\" not far away, which is a very\nbelittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique\nFrancaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these \"piou-pious,\" less fortunate\nfor the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at\nside, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the\nmoment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot\nnear the music.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant \"piou-piou\"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his\nfiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under\nthis system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given\nin marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be\nfree, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an\nelopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]\n\nThe music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A\nfew linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady\nwho rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long\nshadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,\namong the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes\nthe great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,\nbehind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to\ndine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange\ncontrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its\nhabitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these\nhappy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking\ncourses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high\nrank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,\nwith that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of\ntheir race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of\ndarker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every\nclime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter\nand become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems\nout of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its\nexclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from\nthe East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back\nfrom their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they\nwill impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining\nthere nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of\nBohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon\ncamarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent\nnew-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few\ntrees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly\npolite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner\nis warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none\nthe less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she\nwill sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and\nthe other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]\n\nThis later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and\ngirls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come\nin and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a\npublic place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what\none orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who\nare dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and\nwhat, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the\nlittle girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with\nRenould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to\nwelcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier\nbetween the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly\ncrowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette\nand the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and\nsculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these\nstrangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, \"do look at that\nqueer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually\nkissed him!\"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,\nand besides, the tall girl in black has known the little \"type\" for a\nParisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered\nthrough the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but\nif those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You\nwill find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the\nlittle refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity\nand kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one\nwish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX\n\n\"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER\"\n\n\nThere are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country\nvillage.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy\nslaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant\nlots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,\nsmoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if\npointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these\nragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for\nfootpads.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the apple there.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of\nstudios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their\never-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that\nany of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after\nwandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a\nfew bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the\ngentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the\nstudents were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and\nready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate\nand forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at\nthe fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear\nof such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of\nwar.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and\ngipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans\nat certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within\nthe Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]\n\nAnd very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of\nhalf a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these\nshiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil\ntorches.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain\nthat hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,\nso short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted\nlady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a\nbull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,\nwhich is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of\nstudents--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a\ncircus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by\nthe enthusiastic bystanders.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the apple.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de\nNeuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and\ncontinues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth\ncarousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within\nthe circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ\nshakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white\nwooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and\nswoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and\nshouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built\noriginally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a\nfellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to \"supe\"\nin a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled \"Afrique a Paris.\"We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an\nold circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and\nintelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no\nlanguage but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant\npersonality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and\nthe pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,\nand with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a\nnewspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of\nthe hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]\n\nHere we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no\ngreasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning\ncountenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,\nthere were cowboys and \"greasers\" and diving elks, and a company of\nFrench Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign\nabout the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown\nthe entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had\ngathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had\nleft their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves\nstranded in Paris.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the\nAfrican war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,\nto brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and\ngiving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,\nthe sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an\nunpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing \"The Awakening of the Lion,\" the\ncurtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and\nhigh-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the\nstage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with\nits high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems\nto penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill\nof the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled\nthe latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,\nand sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its\nlock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,\nroaring lot into the corner of the cage.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.The smoke from his revolver\ndrifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked\nslowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he\napproached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the\nothers slunk into the opposite corner.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.The man's head was but half a\nfoot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little\nriding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his\nblack nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped\nawkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the\nrest, into the corner.It was the little\nriding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the\nheavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew.\"An ugly lot,\" I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken\nhis seat beside me.\"Yes,\" he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; \"green\nstock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a\ngirl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a\ndream--French, too!\"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the\nwings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in\nfull fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a\npowerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of\nthe trainer.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\n\"No, she never worked with the cats before,\" he said; \"she's new to the\nshow business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a\nchocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We\ngave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's\na good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in\nfront.\"\"How did you get her to take the job?\"\"Well,\" he replied, \"she balked at the act at first, but I showed her\ntwo violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and\nafter that she signed for six weeks.\"he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby\nmustache and smiled.\"This is the last act in the olio, so you will have\nto excuse me.*     *     *     *     *\n\nThere are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are\nalive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public\ninstitutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking\ngarden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the\nBoulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it\nseems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from\nthere on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of\nmarket and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the\nLatin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed\na fortnight, expecting daily to see from his \"chambers\" the gaiety of a\nBohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing\nsojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of\nthe Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]\n\nBut the man from Denver, the \"Steel King,\" and the two thinner\ngentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom\nFortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to\n\"The Great Red Star copper mine\"--a find which had ever since been a\nsource of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they\nhad been in Paris a day, and found it, too, \"the best ever,\" as they\nexpressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,\nfor it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and\nVienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every\nMinute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,\nleaning over the railing at the \"Bal Bullier,\" gazing at the sea of\ndancers.\"Billy,\" said the man from Denver to the Steel King, \"if they had this\nin Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes\"--he\nwiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his\ntwenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between\nhis teeth.it beats all I ever see,\" and he chuckled to\nhimself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in\nsmiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' \"did you get on\nto that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record\nof refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in\npassing.\"Certainly, sit right down,\" cried the Steel King.\"Here, Jack,\"--this\nto the aged garcon, \"smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll\nhave\"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and\nthe garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, \"un cafe\nglace pour moi.\"\"Et moi,\" answered her companion gayly, \"Je prends une limonade!\"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; \"git 'em\na good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,\nand two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, \"all straight,\nfriend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your\nhoop and git back with 'em.\"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; \"whiskey!At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses.\"Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?\"\"Certainly,\" cried the Steel King; \"here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,\"\nand he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.The\ntaller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in\ntheir fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the\ncorners of her pretty mouth.The\nsmaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her\nhead as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed\nbut a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nThe \"copper twins\" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging\nover the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two\npretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at\nfirst sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the \"copper\ntwins\" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic\nbrunettes was limited to \"Oh, yes!\"\"Good morning,\" \"Good\nevening,\" and \"I love you.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.The four held hands over the low railing,\nuntil the \"copper twins\" fairly steamed in talk;

danced at the \"Bullier\";\nstarved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all\nbeen a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the\ndevelopment of their several geniuses, a development which in later life\nhas placed them at the head of their professions.These years of\ncamaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch\nwith everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the\npetty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a\nstraight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all\nthe while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the\nvery air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the\nworking-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived\nit he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have\nbeen broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and\nworked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed\nwithin these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it\nknow its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]\n\nPochard has seen it;

only his art redeemed these\neccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite\nstatuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in\nfull armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph\nin flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into\nthe stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely\ncarved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart\nof this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another \"bon garcon\"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no\nbounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen\ndaily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the\none he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of\nhis vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with\nwindows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the\ntheaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject\nseemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a\nback flat to a third act, and commence on a \"Fall of Babylon\" or a\n\"Carnage of Rome\" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the\narena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of\nunfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast\ncircle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The\nold gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at\nthe end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which\nI dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his\nclothes; the face was still in its primary drawing.\"The face I shall do in time,\" the enthusiast assured the reverend man\nexcitedly; \"it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to\nget.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put\nin your boots?\"\"Does monsieur think I am not a\nvery busy man?\"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:\n\n\"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow\nby my boy.\"But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon\none with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents\nrelative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,\nbearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red\ntags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching\ndeparture, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's\nwindow.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: \"Is it true, monsieur,\nyou are going Saturday?\"\"Yes,\" I answer; \"unfortunately, it is quite true.\"The old man sighs and replies: \"I once had to leave Paris myself\";\nlooking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty.\"The patron of the tobacco-shop,\nand madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the\nlittle street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me \"bon voyage,\"\naccompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois\nhas gone to hunt for a cab--a \"galerie,\" as it is called, with a place\nfor trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no \"galerie\" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find\none, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my\nvalise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel\ncourt.The \"galerie\" has arrived--with the smallest of the three\ndaughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get\ndown.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come\nup to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to\nlose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,\nheaded by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search\nconsiderably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers\nand myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes\nde menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the\nFrench Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an\nassuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and\nchained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and\nsqueaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom\nhas been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Lazare,\nchanges his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently\nthinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,\nas the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it\nreaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window.\"Monsieur,\" says the aged cocher, \"it is an impossibility!I regret very\nmuch to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate.\"A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and\ntake a look;

Revelations, twalfth chapter, third and\nfourth verses.\"Here the old lady stopped, apparently much more from lack of breath than\nof matter.said one of the dragoons, \"gag her, and take her to\nhead-quarters.\"\"For shame, Andrews,\" said Bothwell; \"remember the good lady belongs to\nthe fair sex, and uses only the privilege of her tongue.--But, hark ye,\ngood woman, every bull of Bashan and Red Dragon will not be so civil as I\nam, or be contented to leave you to the charge of the constable and\nducking-stool.In the meantime I must necessarily carry off this young\nman to head-quarters.I cannot answer to my commanding-officer to leave\nhim in a house where I have heard so much treason and fanaticism.\"\"Se now, mither, what ye hae dune,\" whispered Cuddie; \"there's the\nPhilistines, as ye ca' them, are gaun to whirry awa' Mr Henry, and a' wi'\nyour nash-gab, deil be on't!\"\"Haud yere tongue, ye cowardly loon,\" said the mother, \"and layna the\nwyte on me; if you and thae thowless gluttons, that are sitting staring\nlike cows bursting on clover, wad testify wi' your hands as I have\ntestified wi' my tongue, they should never harle the precious young lad\nawa' to captivity.\"While this dialogue passed, the soldiers had already bound and secured\ntheir prisoner.Milnwood returned at this instant, and, alarmed at the\npreparations he beheld, hastened to proffer to Bothwell, though with many\na grievous groan, the purse of gold which he had been obliged to rummage\nout as ransom for his nephew.The trooper took the purse with an air of\nindifference, weighed it in his hand, chucked it up into the air, and\ncaught it as it fell, then shook his head, and said, \"There's many a\nmerry night in this nest of yellow boys, but d--n me if I dare venture\nfor them--that old woman has spoken too loud, and before all the men\ntoo.--Hark ye, old gentleman,\" to Milnwood, \"I must take your nephew to\nhead-quarters, so I cannot, in conscience, keep more than is my due as\ncivility-money;\" then opening the purse, he gave a gold piece to each of\nthe soldiers, and took three to himself.\"Now,\" said he, \"you have the\ncomfort to know that your kinsman, young Captain Popinjay, will be\ncarefully looked after and civilly used; and the rest of the money I\nreturn to you.\"\"Only you know,\" said Bothwell, still playing with the purse, \"that every\nlandholder is answerable for the conformity and loyalty of his household,\nand that these fellows of mine are not obliged to be silent on the\nsubject of the fine sermon we have had from that old puritan in the\ntartan plaid there; and I presume you are aware that the consequences of\ndelation will be a heavy fine before the council.\"exclaimed the terrified miser, \"I am\nsure there is no person in my house, to my knowledge, would give cause of\noffence.\"\"Nay,\" answered Bothwell, \"you shall hear her give her testimony, as she\ncalls it, herself.--You fellow,\" (to Cuddie,) \"stand back, and let your\nmother speak her mind.I see she's primed and loaded again since her\nfirst discharge.\"noble sir,\" said Cuddie, \"an auld wife's tongue's but a feckless\nmatter to mak sic a fash about.Neither my father nor me ever minded\nmuckle what our mither said.\"\"Hold your peace, my lad, while you are well,\" said Bothwell; \"I promise\nyou I think you are slyer than you would like to be supposed.--Come, good\ndame, you see your master will not believe that you can give us so bright\na testimony.\"Mause's zeal did not require this spur to set her again on full career.\"Woe to the compliers and carnal self-seekers,\" she said, \"that daub over\nand drown their consciences by complying with wicked exactions, and\ngiving mammon of unrighteousness to the sons of Belial, that it may make\ntheir peace with them!It is a sinful compliance, a base confederacy with\nthe Enemy.It is the evil that Menahem did in the sight of the Lord, when\nhe gave a thousand talents to Pul, King of Assyria, that his hand might\nbe with him; Second Kings, feifteen chapter, nineteen verse.It is the\nevil deed of Ahab, when he sent money to Tiglath-Peleser; see the saame\nSecond Kings, saxteen and aught.And if it was accounted a backsliding\neven in godly Hezekiah, that he complied with Sennacherib, giving him\nmoney, and offering to bear that which was put upon him, (see the saame\nSecond Kings, aughteen chapter, fourteen and feifteen verses,) even so it\nis with them that in this contumacious and backsliding generation pays\nlocalities and fees, and cess and fines, to greedy and unrighteous\npublicans, and extortions and stipends to hireling curates, (dumb dogs\nwhich bark not, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber,) and gives gifts\nto be helps and hires to our oppressors and destroyers.They are all like\nthe casters of a lot with them--like the preparing of a table for the\ntroop, and the furnishing a drink-offering to the number.\"\"There's a fine sound of doctrine for you, Mr Morton!said Bothwell;

\"but it's your own\naffair;\" and he proffered back the purse with its diminished contents,\nwith an air of indifference.Milnwood, whose head seemed stunned by the accumulation of his\nmisfortunes, extended his hand mechanically to take the purse.said his housekeeper, in a whisper; \"tell them to keep\nit;--they will keep it either by fair means or foul, and it's our only\nchance to make them quiet.\"\"I canna do it, Ailie--I canna do it,\" said Milnwood, in the bitterness\nof his heart.\"I canna part wi' the siller I hae counted sae often ower,\nto thae blackguards.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.\"Then I maun do it mysell, Milnwood,\" said the housekeeper, \"or see a'\ngang wrang thegither.--My master, sir,\" she said, addressing Bothwell,\n\"canna think o' taking back ony thing at the hand of an honourable\ngentleman like you;

\"cannot you see she's better\nwhere she is, so long as there is a respectable, sponsible, money-broking\nheritor, like Mr Morton of Milnwood, who has the means of atoning her\ntrespasses?Let the old mother fly to raise another brood, she's too\ntough to be made any thing of herself--Here,\" he cried, \"one other round\nto Milnwood and his roof-tree, and to our next merry meeting with\nhim!--which I think will not be far distant, if he keeps such a fanatical\nfamily.\"He then ordered the party to take their horses, and pressed the best in\nMilnwood's stable into the king's service to carry the prisoner.Mrs\nWilson, with weeping eyes, made up a small parcel of necessaries for\nHenry's compelled journey, and as she bustled about, took an opportunity,\nunseen by the party, to slip into his hand a small sum of money.Bothwell\nand his troopers, in other respects, kept their promise, and were civil.They did not bind their prisoner, but contented themselves with leading\nhis horse between a file of men.They then mounted, and marched off with\nmuch mirth and laughter among themselves, leaving the Milnwood family in\ngreat confusion.The old Laird himself, overpowered by the loss of his\nnephew, and the unavailing outlay of twenty pounds sterling, did nothing\nthe whole evening but rock himself backwards and forwards in his great\nleathern easy-chair, repeating the same lamentation, of \"Ruined on a'\nsides, ruined on a' sides--harried and undone--harried and undone--body\nand gudes, body and gudes!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Mrs Alison Wilson's grief was partly indulged and partly relieved by the\ntorrent of invectives with which she accompanied Mause and Cuddie's\nexpulsion from Milnwood.\"Ill luck be in the graning corse o' thee!the prettiest lad in\nClydesdale this day maun be a sufferer, and a' for you and your daft\nwhiggery!\"\"Gae wa',\" replied Mause;

\"you are a smart pretty lad,\nand well connected; the worst that will happen will be strapping up for\nit, and that is many an honest fellow's lot.I tell you fairly your\nlife's within the compass of the law, unless you make submission, and get\noff by a round fine upon your uncle's estate;

\"women, wine, and wassail, all to be had\nfor little but the asking; and if you find it in your conscience to let a\nfat priest think he has some chance to convert you, gad he'll help you to\nthese comforts himself, just to gain a little ground in your good\naffection.Where will you find a crop-eared whig parson will be so\ncivil?\"\"Why, nowhere, I agree with you,\" said Henry; \"but what was your chief\nduty?\"\"To guard the king's person,\" said Bothwell, \"to look after the safety of\nLouis le Grand, my boy, and now and then to take a turn among the\nHuguenots (protestants, that is.)And there we had fine scope; it brought\nmy hand pretty well in for the service in this country.But, come, as you\nare to be a bon camerado, as the Spaniards say, I must put you in cash\nwith some of your old uncle's broad-pieces.This is cutter's law; we must\nnot see a pretty fellow want, if we have cash ourselves.\"Thus speaking, he pulled out his purse, took out some of the contents,\nand offered them to Henry without counting them.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Young Morton declined\nthe favour; and, not judging it prudent to acquaint the sergeant,\nnotwithstanding his apparent generosity, that he was actually in\npossession of some money, he assured him he should have no difficulty in\ngetting a supply from his uncle.\"Well,\" said Bothwell, \"in that case these yellow rascals must serve to\nballast my purse a little longer.I always make it a rule never to quit\nthe tavern (unless ordered on duty) while my purse is so weighty that I\ncan chuck it over the signpost.[Note: A Highland laird, whose\npeculiarities live still in the recollection of his countrymen, used to\nregulate his residence at Edinburgh in the following manner: Every day he\nvisited the Water-gate, as it is called, of the Canongate, over which is\nextended a wooden arch.Specie being then the general currency, he threw\nhis purse over the gate, and as long as it was heavy enough to be thrown\nover, he continued his round of pleasure in the metropolis; when it was\ntoo light, he thought it time to retire to the Highlands.Query--How\noften would he have repeated this experiment at Temple Bar?]When it is\nso light that the wind blows it back, then, boot and saddle,--we must\nfall on some way of replenishing.--But what tower is that before us,\nrising so high upon the steep bank, out of the woods that surround it on\nevery side?\"\"It is the tower of Tillietudlem,\" said one of the soldiers.\"Old Lady\nMargaret Bellenden lives there.She's one of the best affected women in\nthe country, and one that's a soldier's friend.When I was hurt by one of\nthe d--d whig dogs that shot at me from behind a fauld-dike, I lay a\nmonth there, and would stand such another wound to be in as good quarters\nagain.\"\"If that be the case,\" said Bothwell, \"I will pay my respects to her as\nwe pass, and request some refreshment for men and horses; I am as thirsty\nalready as if I had drunk nothing at Milnwood.But it is a good thing in\nthese times,\" he continued, addressing himself to Henry, \"that the King's\nsoldier cannot pass a house without getting a refreshment.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the apple there.In such houses\nas Tillie--what d'ye call it?you are served for love; in the houses of\nthe avowed fanatics you help yourself by force; and among the moderate\npresbyterians and other suspicious persons, you are well treated from\nfear; so your thirst is always quenched on some terms or other.\"\"And you purpose,\" said Henry, anxiously, \"to go upon that errand up to\nthe tower younder?\"\"To be sure I do,\" answered Bothwell.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.\"How should I be able to report\nfavourably to my officers of the worthy lady's sound principles, unless I\nknow the taste of her sack, for sack she will produce--that I take for\ngranted; it is the favourite consoler of your old dowager of quality, as\nsmall claret is the potation of your country laird.\"\"Then, for heaven's sake,\" said Henry, \"if you are determined to go\nthere, do not mention my name, or expose me to a family that I am\nacquainted with.Let me be muffled up for the time in one of your\nsoldier's cloaks, and only mention me generally as a prisoner under your\ncharge.\"\"With all my heart,\" said Bothwell; \"I promised to use you civilly, and I\nscorn to break my word.--Here, Andrews, wrap a cloak round the prisoner,\nand do not mention his name, nor where we caught him, unless you would\nhave a trot on a horse of wood.\"The punishment of riding the wooden mare was,\n     in the days of Charles and long after, one of the various and cruel\n     modes of enforcing military discipline.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the football there.In front of the old\n     guard-house in the High Street of Edinburgh, a large horse of this\n     kind was placed, on which now and then, in the more ancient times, a\n     veteran might be seen mounted, with a firelock tied to each foot,\n     atoning for some small offence.There is a singular work, entitled Memoirs of Prince William Henry,\n     Duke of Gloucester, (son of Queen Anne,) from his birth to his ninth\n     year, in which Jenkin Lewis, an honest Welshman in attendance on the\n     royal infant's person, is pleased to record that his Royal Highness\n     laughed, cried, crow'd, and said Gig and Dy, very like a babe of\n     plebeian descent.He had also a premature taste for the discipline\n     as well as the show of war, and had a corps of twenty-two boys,\n     arrayed with paper caps and wooden swords.For the maintenance of\n     discipline in this juvenile corps, a wooden horse was established in\n     the Presence-chamber, and was sometimes employed in the punishment\n     of offences not strictly military.Hughes, the Duke's tailor, having\n     made him a suit of clothes which were too tight, was appointed, in\n     an order of the day issued by the young prince, to be placed on this\n     penal steed.The man of remnants, by dint of supplication and\n     mediation, escaped from the penance, which was likely to equal the\n     inconveniences of his brother artist's equestrian trip to Brentford.But an attendant named Weatherly, who had presumed to bring the\n     young Prince a toy, (after he had discarded the use of them,) was\n     actually mounted on the wooden horse without a saddle, with his face\n     to the tail, while he was plied by four servants of the household\n     with syringes and squirts, till he had a thorough wetting.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.\"He was a\n     waggish fellow,\" says Lewis, \"and would not lose any thing for the\n     joke's sake when he was putting his tricks upon others, so he was\n     obliged to submit cheerfully to what was inflicted upon him, being\n     at our mercy to play him off well, which we did accordingly.\"Amid\n     much such nonsense, Lewis's book shows that this poor child, the\n     heir of the British monarchy, who died when he was eleven years old,\n     was, in truth, of promising parts, and of a good disposition.The\n     volume, which rarely occurs, is an octavo, published in 1789, the\n     editor being Dr Philip Hayes of Oxford.]They were at this moment at an arched gateway, battlemented and flanked\nwith turrets, one whereof was totally ruinous, excepting the lower story,\nwhich served as a cow-house to the peasant, whose family inhabited the\nturret that remained entire.The gate had been broken down by Monk's\nsoldiers during the civil war, and had never been replaced, therefore\npresented no obstacle to Bothwell and his party.The avenue, very steep\nand narrow, and causewayed with large round stones, ascended the side of\nthe precipitous bank in an oblique and zigzag course, now showing now\nhiding a view of the tower and its exterior bulwarks, which seemed to\nrise almost perpendicularly above their heads.The fragments of Gothic\ndefences which it exhibited were upon such a scale of strength, as\ninduced Bothwell to exclaim, \"It's well this place is in honest and loyal\nhands.Egad, if the enemy had it, a dozen of old whigamore wives with\ntheir distaffs might keep it against a troop of dragoons, at least if\nthey had half the spunk of the old girl we left at Milnwood.Upon my\nlife,\" he continued, as they came in front of the large double tower and\nits surrounding defences and flankers, \"it is a superb place, founded,\nsays the worn inscription over the gate--unless the remnant of my Latin\nhas given me the slip--by Sir Ralph de Bellenden in 1350--a respectable\nantiquity.I must greet the old lady with due honour, though it should\nput me to the labour of recalling some of the compliments that I used to\ndabble in when I was wont to keep that sort of company.\"As he thus communed with himself, the butler, who had reconnoitred the\nsoldiers from an arrowslit in the wall, announced to his lady, that a\ncommanded party of dragoons, or, as he thought, Life-Guardsmen, waited at\nthe gate with a prisoner under their charge.\"I am certain,\" said Gudyill, \"and positive, that the sixth man is a\nprisoner; for his horse is led, and the two dragoons that are before have\ntheir carabines out of their budgets, and rested upon their thighs.It\nwas aye the way we guarded prisoners in the days of the great Marquis.\"said the lady; \"probably in want of refreshment.Go,\nGudyill, make them welcome, and let them be accommodated with what\nprovision and forage the Tower can afford.--And stay, tell my gentlewoman\nto bring my black scarf and manteau.I will go down myself to receive\nthem; one cannot show the King's Life-Guards too much respect in times\nwhen they are doing so much for royal authority.And d'ye hear, Gudyill,\nlet Jenny Dennison slip on her pearlings to walk before my niece and me,\nand the three women to walk behind; and bid my niece attend me\ninstantly.\"Fully accoutred, and attended according to her directions, Lady Margaret\nnow sailed out into the court-yard of her tower with great courtesy and\ndignity.Sergeant Bothwell saluated the grave and reverend lady of the\nmanor with an assurance which had something of the light and careless\naddress of the dissipated men of fashion in Charles the Second's time,\nand did not at all savour of the awkward or rude manners of a\nnon-commissioned officer of dragoons.His language, as well as his\nmanners, seemed also to be refined for the time and occasion; though the\ntruth was, that, in the fluctuations of an adventurous and profligate\nlife, Bothwell had sometimes kept company much better suited to his\nancestry than to his present situation of life.To the lady's request to\nknow whether she could be of service to them, he answered, with a\nsuitable bow, \"That as they had to march some miles farther that night,\nthey would be much accommodated by permission to rest their horses for an\nhour before continuing their journey.\"\"With the greatest pleasure,\" answered Lady Margaret;

we still call it the King's room.\"Bothwell had by this time dismounted his party, and committed the horses\nto the charge of one file, and the prisoner to that of another; so that\nhe himself was at liberty to continue the conversation which the lady had\nso condescendingly opened.\"Since the King, my master, had the honour to experience your\nhospitality, I cannot wonder that it is extended to those that serve him,\nand whose principal merit is doing it with fidelity.And yet I have a\nnearer relation to his majesty than this coarse red coat would seem to\nindicate.\"Probably,\" said Lady Margaret, \"you have belonged to his\nhousehold?\"\"Not exactly, madam, to his household, but rather to his house; a\nconnexion through which I may claim kindred with most of the best\nfamilies in Scotland, not, I believe, exclusive of that of Tillietudlem.\"said the old lady, drawing herself up with dignity at hearing what\nshe conceived an impertinent jest, \"I do not understand you.\"\"It's but a foolish subject for one in my situation to talk of, madam,\"\nanswered the trooper; \"but you must have heard of the history and\nmisfortunes of my grandfather Francis Stewart, to whom James I., his\ncousin-german, gave the title of Bothwell, as my comrades give me the\nnickname.It was not in the long run more advantageous to him than it is\nto me.\"said Lady Margaret, with much sympathy and surprise; \"I have\nindeed always understood that the grandson of the last Earl was in\nnecessitous circumstances, but I should never have expected to see him so\nlow in the service.With such connexions, what ill fortune could have\nreduced you\"--\n\n\"Nothing much out of the ordinary course, I believe, madam,\" said\nBothwell, interrupting and anticipating the question.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.\"I have had my\nmoments of good luck like my neighbours--have drunk my bottle with\nRochester, thrown a merry main with Buckingham, and fought at Tangiers\nside by side with Sheffield.But my luck never lasted;

and I am certain he feels too much, both what is due to the\nblood which is in your veins, and to the request of a lady so highly\ndistinguished as myself by his most sacred majesty, not to make better\nprovision for you than you have yet received.\"\"I am much obliged to your ladyship, and I certainly will remain her with\nmy prisoner, since you request it, especially as it will be the earliest\nway of presenting him to Colonel Grahame, and obtaining his ultimate\norders about the young spark.\"\"A young fellow of rather the better class in this neighbourhood, who has\nbeen so incautious as to give countenance to one of the murderers of the\nprimate, and to facilitate the dog's escape.\"said Lady Margaret;

again assuring Mr Stewart, that whatever was in the Tower of\nTillietudlem was heartily at his service and that of his attendants.Sergeant Bothwell did not fail to take the lady at her word, and readily\nforgot the height from which his family had descended, in a joyous\ncarousal, during which Mr Harrison exerted himself to produce the best\nwine in the cellar, and to excite his guest to be merry by that seducing\nexample, which, in matters of conviviality, goes farther than precept.Old Gudyill associated himself with a party so much to his taste, pretty\nmuch as Davy, in the Second Part of Henry the Fourth, mingles in the\nrevels of his master, Justice Shallow.He ran down to the cellar at the\nrisk of breaking his neck, to ransack some private catacomb, known, as he\nboasted, only to himself, and which never either had, or should, during\nhis superintendence, renden forth a bottle of its contents to any one but\na real king's friend.\"When the Duke dined here,\" said the butler, seating himself at a\ndistance from the table, being somewhat overawed by Bothwell's genealogy,\nbut yet hitching his seat half a yard nearer at every clause of his\nspeech, \"my leddy was importunate to have a bottle of that\nBurgundy,\"--(here he advanced his seat a little,)--\"but I dinna ken how\nit was, Mr Stewart, I misdoubted him.I jaloused him, sir, no to be the\nfriend to government he pretends: the family are not to lippen to.That\nauld Duke James lost his heart before he lost his head;

but from the prisoner, muffled and disguised as\nhe was, she found it impossible to withdraw her eyes.Yet she blamed\nherself for indulging a curiosity which seemed obviously to give pain to\nhim who was its object.\"I wish,\" she said to Jenny Dennison, who was the immediate attendant on\nher person, \"I wish we knew who that poor fellow is.\"\"I was just thinking sae mysell, Miss Edith,\" said the waiting woman,\n\"but it canna be Cuddie Headrigg, because he's taller and no sae stout.\"\"Yet,\" continued Miss Bellenden, \"it may be some poor neigbour, for whom\nwe might have cause to interest ourselves.\"\"I can sune learn wha he is,\" said the enterprising Jenny, \"if the\nsodgers were anes settled and at leisure, for I ken ane o' them very\nweel--the best-looking and the youngest o' them.\"\"I think you know all the idle young fellows about the country,\" answered\nher mistress.\"Na, Miss Edith, I am no sae free o' my acquaintance as that,\" answered\nthe fille-de-chambre.\"To be sure, folk canna help kenning the folk by\nhead-mark that they see aye glowring and looking at them at kirk and\nmarket;

\"does it prove to be Cuddie,\nafter all, poor fellow?\"it's nae Cuddie,\" blubbered out the faithful\nfille-de-chambre, sensible of the pain which her news were about to\ninflict on her young mistress.\"O dear, Miss Edith, it's young Milnwood\nhimsell!\"exclaimed Edith, aghast in her turn; \"it is\nimpossible--totally impossible!--His uncle attends the clergyman\nindulged by law, and has no connexion whatever with the refractory\npeople; and he himself has never interfered in this unhappy dissension;\nhe must be totally innocent, unless he has been standing up for some\ninvaded right.\"\"O, my dear Miss Edith,\" said her attendant, \"these are not days to ask\nwhat's right or what's wrang;

think on the danger\nand the difficulty,\" added Jenny; \"for he's kept under close confinement\ntill Claverhouse comes up in the morning, and if he doesna gie him full\nsatisfaction, Tam Halliday says there will be brief wark wi' him--Kneel\ndown--mak ready--present--fire--just as they did wi' auld deaf John\nMacbriar, that never understood a single question they pat till him, and\nsae lost his life for lack o' hearing.\"\"Jenny,\" said the young lady, \"if he should die, I will die with him;\nthere is no time to talk of danger or difficulty--I will put on a plaid,\nand slip down with you to the place where they have kept him--I will\nthrow myself at the feet of the sentinel, and entreat him, as he has a\nsoul to be saved\"--\n\n\"Eh, guide us!\"interrupted the maid, \"our young leddy at the feet o'\nTrooper Tam, and speaking to him about his soul, when the puir chield\nhardly kens whether he has ane or no, unless that he whiles swears by\nit--that will never do;

but ye maun let me hae my\nain gate and no speak ae word--he's keeping guard o'er Milnwood in the\neaster round of the tower.\"\"Go, go, fetch me a plaid,\" said Edith.\"Let me but see him, and I will\nfind some remedy for his danger--Haste ye, Jenny, as ever ye hope to have\ngood at my hands.\"Jenny hastened, and soon returned with a plaid, in which Edith muffled\nherself so as completely to screen her face, and in part to disguise her\nperson.This was a mode of arranging the plaid very common among the\nladies of that century, and the earlier part of the succeeding one; so\nmuch so, indeed, that the venerable sages of the Kirk, conceiving that\nthe mode gave tempting facilities for intrigue, directed more than one\nact of Assembly against this use of the mantle.But fashion, as usual,\nproved too strong for authority, and while plaids continued to be worn,\nwomen of all ranks occasionally employed them as a sort of muffler or\nveil.[Note: Concealment of an individual, while in public or promiscuous\nsociety, was then very common.In England, where no plaids were worn, the\nladies used vizard masks for the same purpose, and the gallants drew the\nskirts of their cloaks over the right shoulder, so as to cover part of\nthe face.This is repeatedly alluded to in Pepys's Diary.]Her face and\nfigure thus concealed, Edith, holding by her attendant's arm, hastened\nwith trembling steps to the place of Morton's confinement.This was a small study or closet, in one of the turrets, opening upon a\ngallery in which the sentinel was pacing to and fro; for Sergeant\nBothwell, scrupulous in observing his word, and perhaps touched with some\ncompassion for the prisoner's youth and genteel demeanour, had waved the\nindignity of putting his guard into the same apartment with him.Halliday, therefore, with his carabine on his arm, walked up and down the\ngallery, occasionally solacing himself with a draught of ale, a huge\nflagon of which stood upoon the table at one end of the apartment, and at\nother times humming the lively Scottish air,\n\n\"Between Saint Johnstone and Bonny Dundee, I'll gar ye be fain to follow\nme.\"Jenny Dennison cautioned her mistress once more to let her take her own\nway.\"I can manage the trooper weel eneugh,\" she said, \"for as rough as he\nis--I ken their nature weel; but ye maunna say a single word.\"She accordingly opened the door of the gallery just as the sentinel had\nturned his back from it, and taking up the tune which he hummed, she sung\nin a coquettish tone of rustic raillery,\n\n\"If I were to follow a poor sodger lad, My friends wad be angry, my\nminnie be mad; A laird, or a lord, they were fitter for me, Sae I'll\nnever be fain to follow thee.\"--\n\n\"A fair challenge, by Jove,\" cried the sentinel, turning round, \"and from\ntwo at once; but it's not easy to bang the soldier with his bandoleers;\"\nthen taking up the song where the damsel had stopt,\n\n\"To follow me ye weel may be glad, A share of my supper, a share of my\nbed, To the sound of the drum to range fearless and free, I'll gar ye be\nfain to follow me.\"--\n\n\"Come, my pretty lass, and kiss me for my song.\"\"I should not have thought of that, Mr Halliday,\" answered Jenny, with a\nlook and tone expressing just the necessary degree of contempt at the\nproposal, \"and, I'se assure ye, ye'll hae but little o' my company unless\nye show gentler havings--It wasna to hear that sort o'nonsense that\nbrought me here wi' my friend, and ye should think shame o' yoursell, 'at\nshould ye.\"and what sort of nonsense did bring you here then, Mrs Dennison?\"\"My kinswoman has some particular business with your prisoner, young Mr\nHarry Morton, and I am come wi' her to speak till him.\"answered the sentinel; \"and pray, Mrs Dennison, how\ndo your kinswoman and you propose to get in?You are rather too plump to\nwhisk through a keyhole, and opening the door is a thing not to be spoke\nof.\"\"It's no a thing to be spoken o', but a thing to be dune,\" replied the\npersevering damsel.\"We'll see about that, my bonny Jenny;\" and the soldier resumed his\nmarch, humming, as he walked to and fro along the gallery,\n\n\"Keek into the draw-well, Janet, Janet, Then ye'll see your bonny sell,\nMy joe Janet.\"\"So ye're no thinking to let us in, Mr Halliday?Weel, weel; gude e'en to\nyou--ye hae seen the last o' me, and o' this bonny die too,\" said Jenny,\nholding between her finger and thumb a splendid silver dollar.\"Give him gold, give him gold,\" whispered the agitated young lady.\"Silver's e'en ower gude for the like o' him,\" replied Jenny, \"that disna\ncare for the blink o' a bonny lassie's ee--and what's waur, he wad think\nthere was something mair in't than a kinswoman o' mine.siller's no sae plenty wi' us, let alane gowd.\"Having addressed this\nadvice aside to her mistress, she raised her voice, and said, \"My cousin\nwinna stay ony langer, Mr Halliday; sae, if ye please, gude e'en t'ye.\"\"Halt a bit, halt a bit,\" said the trooper; \"rein up and parley, Jenny.If I let your kinswoman in to speak to my prisoner, you must stay here\nand keep me company till she come out again, and then we'll all be well\npleased you know.\"\"The fiend be in my feet then,\" said Jenny; \"d'ye think my kinswoman and\nme are gaun to lose our gude name wi' cracking clavers wi' the like o'\nyou or your prisoner either, without somebody by to see fair play?Hegh,\nhegh, sirs, to see sic a difference between folk's promises and\nperformance!Ye were aye willing to slight puir Cuddie; but an I had\nasked him to oblige me in a thing, though it had been to cost his\nhanging, he wadna hae stude twice about it.\"retorted the dragoon, \"he'll be hanged in good earnest, I\nhope.I saw him today at Milnwood with his old puritanical b--of a\nmother, and if I had thought I was to have had him cast in my dish, I\nwould have brought him up at my horse's tail--we had law enough to bear\nus out.\"\"Very weel, very weel--See if Cuddie winna hae a lang shot at you ane o'\nthae days, if ye gar him tak the muir wi' sae mony honest folk.He can\nhit a mark brawly;

d--n me, if I hang fire more than another when I have said\na thing,\" said the soldier, in a hesitating tone.\"Drinking and driving ower,\" quoth Jenny, \"wi' the Steward and John\nGudyill.\"\"So, so--he's safe enough--and where are my comrades?\"\"Birling the brown bowl wi' the fowler and the falconer, and some o' the\nserving folk.\"\"Sax gallons, as gude as e'er was masked,\" said the maid.\"Well, then, my pretty Jenny,\" said the relenting sentinel, \"they are\nfast till the hour of relieving guard, and perhaps something later; and\nso, if you will promise to come alone the next time\"--\"Maybe I will, and\nmaybe I winna,\" said Jenny; \"but if ye get the dollar, ye'll like that\njust as weel.\"\"I'll be d--n'd if I do,\" said Halliday, taking the money, howeve; \"but\nit's always something for my risk; for, if Claverhouse hears what I have\ndone, he will build me a horse as high as the Tower of Tillietudlem.But\nevery one in the regiment takes what they can come by; I am sure Bothwell\nand his blood-royal shows us a good example.And if I were trusting to\nyou, you little jilting devil, I should lose both pains and powder;\nwhereas this fellow,\" looking at the piece, \"will be good as far as he\ngoes.So, come, there is the door open for you; do not stay groaning and\npraying with the young whig now, but be ready, when I call at the door,\nto start, as if they were sounding 'Horse and away.'\"So speaking, Halliday unlocked the door of the closet, admitted Jenny and\nher pretended kinswoman, locked it behind them, and hastily reassumed the\nindifferent measured step and time-killing whistle of a sentinel upon his\nregular duty.The door, which slowly opened, discovered Morton with both arms reclined\nupon a table, and his head resting upon them in a posture of deep\ndejection.He raised his face as the door opened, and, perceiving the\nfemale figures which it admitted, started up in great surprise.Edith, as\nif modesty had quelled the courage which despair had bestowed, stood\nabout a yard from the door without having either the power to speak or to\nadvance.All the plans of aid, relief, or comfort, which she had proposed\nto lay before her lover, seemed at once to have vanished from her\nrecollection, and left only a painful chaos of ideas, with which was\nmingled a fear that she had degraded herself in the eyes of Morton by a\nstep which might appear precipitate and unfeminine.She hung motionless\nand almost powerless upon the arm of her attendant, who in vain\nendeavoured to reassure and inspire her with courage, by whispering, \"We\nare in now, madam, and we maun mak the best o' our time; for, doubtless,\nthe corporal or the sergeant will gang the rounds, and it wad be a pity\nto hae the poor lad Halliday punished for his civility.\"Morton, in the meantime, was timidly advancing, suspecting the truth; for\nwhat other female in the house, excepting Edith herself, was likely to\ntake an interest in his misfortunes?and yet afraid, owing to the\ndoubtful twilight and the muffled dress, of making some mistake which\nmight be prejudicial to the object of his affections.Jenny, whose ready\nwit and forward manners well qualified her for such an office, hastened\nto break the ice.\"Mr Morton, Miss Edith's very sorry for your present situation, and\"--\n\nIt was needless to say more; he was at her side, almost at her feet,\npressing her unresisting hands, and loading her with a profusion of\nthanks and gratitude which would be hardly intelligible from the mere\nbroken words, unless we could describe the tone, the gesture, the\nimpassioned and hurried indications of deep and tumultuous feeling, with\nwhich they were accompanied.For two or three minutes, Edith stood as motionless as the statue of a\nsaint which receives the adoration of a worshipper; and when she\nrecovered herself sufficiently to withdraw her hands from Henry's grasp,\nshe could at first only faintly articulate, \"I have taken a strange step,\nMr Morton--a step,\" she continued with more coherence, as her ideas\narranged themselves in consequence of a strong effort, \"that perhaps may\nexpose me to censure in your eyes--But I have long permitted you to use\nthe language of friendship--perhaps I might say more--too long to leave\nyou when the world seems to have left you.How, or why, is this\nimprisonment?can my uncle, who thinks so highly of\nyou--can your own kinsman, Milnwood, be of no use?\"Be what it will,\" answered Henry, contriving to make himself master of\nthe hand that had escaped from him, but which was now again abandoned to\nhis clasp, \"be what it will, it is to me from this moment the most\nwelcome incident of a weary life.To you, dearest Edith--forgive me, I\nshould have said Miss Bellenden, but misfortune claims strange\nprivileges--to you I have owed the few happy moments which have gilded a\ngloomy existence; and if I am now to lay it down, the recollection of\nthis honour will be my happiness in the last hour of suffering.\"\"Have you, who\nused to mix so little in these unhappy feuds, become so suddenly and\ndeeply implicated, that nothing short of\"--\n\nShe paused, unable to bring out the word which should have come next.\"Nothing short of my life, you would say?\"replied Morton, in a calm, but\nmelancholy tone; \"I believe that will be entirely in the bosoms of my\njudges.My guards spoke of a possibility of exchanging the penalty for\nentry into foreign service.I thought I could have embraced the\nalternative; and yet, Miss Bellenden, since I have seen you once more, I\nfeel that exile would be more galling than death.\"\"And is it then true,\" said Edith, \"that you have been so desperately\nrash as to entertain communication with any of those cruel wretches who\nassassinated the primate?\"\"I knew not even that such a crime had been committed,\" replied Morton,\n\"when I gave unhappily a night's lodging and concealment to one of those\nrash and cruel men, the ancient friend and comrade of my father.But my\nignorance will avail me little; for who, Miss Bellenden, save you, will\nbelieve it?And, what is worse, I am at least uncertain whether, even if\nI had known the crime, I could have brought my mind, under all the\ncircumstances, to refuse a temporary refuge to the fugitive.\"\"And by whom,\" said Edith, anxiously, \"or under what authority, will the\ninvestigation of your conduct take place?\"\"Under that of Colonel Grahame of Claverhouse, I am given to understand,\"\nsaid Morton; \"one of the military commission, to whom it has pleased our\nking, our privy council, and our parliament, that used to be more\ntenacious of our liberties, to commit the sole charge of our goods and of\nour lives.\"said Edith, faintly;

Clarke gave\none to her husband upon his birthday, April 8.I think everybody ought\nto own a flag._April_ 26.--Now we have the news that J. Wilkes Booth, who shot the\nPresident and who has been concealing himself in Virginia, has been\ncaught, and refusing to surrender was shot dead.It has taken just\ntwelve days to bring him to retribution.I am glad that he is dead if he\ncould not be taken alive, but it seems as though shooting was too good\nfor him.However, we may as well take this as really God's way, as the\ndeath of the President, for if he had been taken alive, the country\nwould have been so furious to get at him and tear him to pieces the\nturmoil would have been great and desperate.It may be the best way to\ndispose of him.Of course, it is best, or it would not be so.Morse\ncalled this evening and he thinks Booth was shot by a lot of cowards.The flags have been flying all day, since the news came, but all,\nexcepting Albert Granger, seem sorry that he was not disabled instead of\nbeing shot dead.Albert seems able to look into the \"beyond\" and also to\nlocate departed spirits.His \"latest\" is that he is so glad that Booth\ngot to h--l before Abraham Lincoln got to Springfield.Fred Thompson went down to New York last Saturday and while stopping\na few minutes at St.Johnsville, he heard a man crowing over the death\nof the President.Thompson marched up to him, collared him and\nlanded him nicely in the gutter.The bystanders were delighted and\ncarried the champion to a platform and called for a speech, which was\ngiven.Every one who hears the story, says:\n\"Three cheers for F.

short\ntrapeze to the rope and performed all sorts of gymnastics.There were at\nleast 1,000 people in the street and in the windows gazing at him.Grandmother says that she thinks all such performances are wicked,\ntempting Providence to win the applause of men.Nothing would induce her\nto look upon such things.She is a born reformer and would abolish all\nsuch schemes.This morning she wanted us to read the 11th chapter of\nHebrews to her, about faith, and when we had finished the forty verses,\nAnna asked her what was the difference between her and Moses.Grandmother said there were many points of difference.Anna was not\nfound in the bulrushes and she was not adopted by a king's daughter.Anna said she was thinking how the verse read, \"Moses was a proper\nchild,\" and she could not remember having ever done anything strictly\n\"proper\" in her life.I noticed that Grandmother did not contradict her,\nbut only smiled._June_ 13.--Van Amburgh's circus was in town to-day and crowds

looked up so bright and said, \"If I had been Mrs.Siam,\nI presume I should have done just as she did.\"I don't believe that we\nwill be as amusing as she is when we are 82 years old._Saturday, July_ 8.--What excitement there must have been in Washington\nyesterday over the execution of the conspirators.Surratt should have deserved hanging with the others.I saw a\npicture of them all upon a scaffold and her face was screened by an\numbrella.I read in one paper that the doctor who dressed Booth's broken\nleg was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas.Jefferson Davis, I suppose, is\nglad to have nothing worse served upon him, thus far, than confinement\nin Fortress Monroe.It is wonderful that 800,000 men are returning so\nquietly from the army to civil life that it is scarcely known, save by\nthe welcome which they receive in their own homes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.Buddington, of Brooklyn, preached to-day.His wife\nwas Miss Elizabeth Willson, Clara

hath\ntriumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\"Then he offered one of his most eloquent and fervent prayers, in\nwhich the returned soldiers, many of whom are in broken health or maimed\nfor life, in consequence of their devotion and loyalty to their country,\nwere tenderly remembered.His text was from the 126th Psalm, \"The Lord\nhath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.\"It was one of his\nbest sermons.He mentioned three things in particular which the Lord has\ndone for us, whereof we are glad: First, that the war has closed;\nsecond, that the Union is preserved; third, for the abolition of\nslavery.After the sermon, a collection was taken for the poor, and Dr.A. D. Eddy, who was present, offered prayer.The choir sang an anthem\nwhich they had especially prepared for the occasion, and then all joined\nin the doxology.Uncle Thomas Beals' family of four united with our\nthree at Thanksgiving dinner.Uncle sent to New York for the oysters,\nand a famous big turkey, with all the usual accompaniments, made us a\nfine repast.Anna and Ritie Tyler are reading together Irving's Life of\nWashington, two afternoons each week.I wonder how long they will keep\nit up._December_ 11.--I have been down town buying material for garments for\nour Home Missionary family which we are to make in our society.Anna and\nI were cutting them out and basting them ready for sewing, and\ngrandmother told us to save all the basting threads when we were through\nwith them and tie them and wind them on a spool for use another time.Anna, who says she never wants to begin anything that she cannot finish\nin 15 minutes, felt rather tired at the prospect of this unexpected task\nand asked Grandmother how she happened to contract such economical\nideas.Grandmother told her that if she and Grandfather had been\nwasteful in their younger days, we would not have any silk dresses to\nwear now.Anna said if that was the case she was glad that Grandmother\nsaved the basting thread!1866\n\n_February_ 13.--Our brother James was married to-day to Louise\nLivingston James of New York City._February_ 20.--Our society is going to hold a fair for the Freedmen, in\nthe Town Hall.Susie Daggett and I have been there all day to see about\nthe tables and stoves._February_ 21.--Been at the hall all day, trimming the room.Backus came down and if they had not helped us we would\nnot have done much.Backus put up all the principal drapery and made\nit look beautiful._February_ 22.--At the hall all day.We had\nquite a crowd in the evening and took in over three hundred dollars.Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there all night to take care\nof the hall.We had a fish pond, a grab-bag and a post-office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.Anna says\nthey had all the smart people in the post-office to write the\nletters,--Mr.Morse, Miss Achert, Albert Granger and herself.Some one\nasked Albert Granger if his law business was good and he said one man\nthronged into his office one day._February_ 23.--We took in two hundred dollars to-day at the fair.George Willson if she could not\nwrite a poem expressing our thanks to Mr.Backus and she stepped aside\nfor about five minutes and handed us the following lines which we sent\nto him.We think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair.\"In ancient time the God of Wine\n    They crowned with vintage of the vine,\n    And sung his praise with song and glee\n    And all their best of minstrelsy.The Backus whom we honor now\n    Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow\n    With heathen emblems--better he\n    Will love our gratitude to see\n    Expressed in all the happy faces\n    Assembled in these pleasant places.May joy attend his footsteps here\n    And crown him in a brighter sphere.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom._February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to\nclean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of\neverything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this\nafternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the\nexpenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of\nthanks:\n\n_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the\nTown Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,\nand the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks\nto the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous\ncontributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public\nenterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young\nladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such\ngenerous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need\nnever again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as\nCanandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But\nour village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New\nYork City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and\nunstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of\nthe hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor\nwould have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are\nespecially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their\nsuperior knowledge and older experience.W.

Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,\nwho is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our\ntable and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They\nheld services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the\nsteamer, and also in the steerage where the text was \"And they willingly\nreceived him into the ship.\"The

first\nencouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most\ninterested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I\nwould, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in\nmy heart.She has only stepped inside the\ntemple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord's entrance\ncall.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It\ndoes not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my\ndear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting\nblessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go\nand smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that \"He who\nholds

enjoyed going\nabout London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna's letter came, after ten days, telling us all\nthe sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last\nnight

Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field\nand I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow\nwhere we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were\nabout to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.We stopped to look at him and felt like\ntelling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and\nspirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak\na-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at\nInversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the\nTrossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, \"All aboard for\nNaples,\" it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely\nin Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming\ncity, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw\nthe window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also\nvisited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the\nAbbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went\nthrough the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the\nlibrary.Sir Walter's chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but\nLaura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for\na moment saying \"I am sure, now, he will be clever.\"We continued our\njourney that night and arrived in London

our power to cheer her in\nher loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,\narrived here to-day for a few days' visit.We had rather a stormy\npassage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel\nand he answered me \"The H'Albert H'Edward, Miss!\"This information must\nhave given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached\nCalais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere\nla Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just\nas they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre\nwithout seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer's, Le\nJeune, to be \"taken\" and had a funny time.He queried \"Parlez-vous\nFrancais?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.I shook my head and asked him \"Parlez-vous Anglaise?\"at\nwhich query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to\ntell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two\nsizes of pictures and asked me \"Le cabinet, le vignette?\"I held up my\nfingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to\nmake ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he\nhoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the\nfirst sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed\nto and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said \"Tres\nbien, Madame,\" and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed\n\"tres bien.\"_October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I\nenjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue\nfor the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a\nPresbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The\nsinging in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang \"Awake my soul\nto joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer's praise,\" it seemed to me\nthat I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in\nthe refrain \"His loving kindness, oh how free.\"The text was \"As an\neagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad\nher wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead\nhim and there was no strange God with him.\"It was a\nwonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we\nnoticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were\nstanding in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of\nSunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I\nhave only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an\nEnglishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being\nso much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, \"In America,\nyou have the 'ops, I know, but you

hearing Abbie sing \"I have a Father in the Promised\nLand,\" they asked her where her Father lived and she said \"In America,\"\nand told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then\nthey turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that\nthe latest cable from America was that U. S.

Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,\nwidow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose\nmaiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,\nand of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of\nCanandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived\nnearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of\nwhom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the\nCongregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful\nsupporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the\nsimple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age\nof which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner\nwhich repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning\ngrace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would\nalmost involuntarily 'rise up before her,' yet loved to be in her\npresence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love\nand peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children's\nchildren what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to\nresort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie\nwhich bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a\ndeep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she\nand her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in\nthe church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its\nactivity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good\nwork.While she was well informed in all current events, she most\ndelighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious\nbooks were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her\nbetter thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her\nnever saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited\nthe Master's call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock\nof corn fully ripe that cometh in its season.\"I don't think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down\nthings of importance.Noah T. Clarke's brother got possession of my\nlittle diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written\non the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:\n\n    \"You'd scarce expect a volume of my size\n    To hold so much that's beautiful and wise,\n    And though the heartless world might call me cheap\n    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,\n    And kindly shelter all who toil below,\n    So my future greatness and the good I do\n    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few.\"I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon\nan old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her\nyouthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, \"Try to be somebody,\" and\non the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for\nunexpected achievement which she could not prevent, \"Some must be\ngreat!\"*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n1880\n\n_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A.

was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with\na long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light\nleather-covered books rising along the walls.At the opposite end of the\nchamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the\ndesk, and his head in his hands.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.The shaded light in front of him made a\nmellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl\u2019s breast as she\nlooked at this figure.Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of\nthe voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled\nit.A gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.This was\nHorace Boyce who sat there before her--and she did not hate him!During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of\nself-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind.This,\nthen, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with\nthe other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged\nher nearly to distraction.The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle\nprocesses, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might\na hero be by sunlit clouds.She hugged the thought to her heart, and\nstood looking at\u2019 him motionless and mute.What is wanted?\u201d he called out, querulously, without\nchanging his posture.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.It was as if a magic voice drew her\nforward in a dream--herself all rapt and dumb.Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head,\nand swung abruptly around in his chair.His own shadow obscured the\nfeatures of his visitor.He saw only that it was a lady, and rose\nhesitatingly to his feet.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cI was busy with my thoughts, and did not know\nwho it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know now?\u201d Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance.The balmy\nwarmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on\nher face.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let\nhis arms fall limp at his sides.\u201cIn the name of the dev--\u201d he began, confusedly, and then bit the word\nshort, and stared at her again.\u201cIs it really you?\u201d he asked at last,\nreassured in part by her smile.\u201cAre you sorry to see me?\u201d she asked in turn.Her mind could frame\nnothing but these soft little meaningless queries.The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question.He\nturned around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight\ndetour he walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the\ndark stairway.When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key\nin the lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock\nit again.\u201cWhy, no; why should I be?\u201d he said in a more natural voice, as he\nreturned and stood beside her.Evidently her amiability was a more\ndifficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he\nstudied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.\u201cCome and sit down here,\u201d he said, after a few moments of this puzzled\ninspection, and resumed his own chair.\u201cI want a good look at you,\u201d he\nexplained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it\nrequired an effort to return his glance.But, when she did so, the\nchanges in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything\nelse from her mind.She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse,\nand bent over him at a diffident distance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.As she did so, she had the\nfeeling that this bitterness in which she had encased herself for years\nhad dropped from her on the instant like a discarded garment.\u201cWhy, Horace, your hair is quite gray!\u201d she said, as if the fact\ncontained the sublimation of pathos.\u201cThere\u2019s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over!You\ndon\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through, my girl,\u201d he said, sadly.The\nnovel sensation of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly\naccentuated his sense of deserving compassion.\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d she said, softly.She had seated herself again, and\nwas gradually recovering her self-possession.The whole situation was\nso remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it\nfrom the outside, as if she were not a component part of it.Her pulses\nwere no longer strongly stirred by its personal phases.Most clear of\nall things in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of\nthis or any other man.She was her own master, and need ask favors from\nnobody.Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a\nfriend of Horace--or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from\nthose bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her\nweary soul a bed of these--what or who was to prevent her?Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant\nin her sight again.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.There was no doubt about it--she had genuine\nsatisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him.Had she\nso many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon\ndeliberately away?Moreover--and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart--he\nwas worn and unhappy.The iron had palpably entered his soul too.He\nlooked years older than he had any chronological right to look.There\nwere heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was\npowdered thick with silver.\u201cYes, I am truly sorry,\u201d she said again.\u201cIs it business that has gone\nwrong with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness--family--health--sleep--everything!\u201d he groaned, bitterly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\u201cIt\nis literally a hell that I have been living in this last--these last few\nmonths!\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea of that,\u201d she said, simply.Of course it would be\nridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had\ncomfort from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.\u201cSo help me God, Jess!\u201d he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of\nher sympathy, \u201cI\u2019m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and\nevery woman a fool!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a long time when _I_ thought that,\u201d she said with a sigh.He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly\nturned his glance away.\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he answered uneasily, tapping\nwith his fingers on the desk.\u201cBut we won\u2019t talk of that,\u201d she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety\nin her tone.\u201cWe needn\u2019t talk of that at all.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.It was merely by accident\nthat I came here, Horace.I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was\nfurther from my head than finding you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see--Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.I didn\u2019t know you knew him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you foolish boy!\u201d she said, with a smile which had a ground tone\nof sadness.It was simply any lawyer I was\nlooking for.But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you\nany more.I\u2019ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were--young\ntogether, and I\u2019m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an\nenemy.You don\u2019t seem so very happy yourself, Horace.Why shouldn\u2019t\nwe two be friends again?I\u2019m not talking of anything else,\nHorace--understand me.But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of\nour being friends again.\u201d\n\nHorace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re the best\nof the lot, dear old Jess,\u201d he said at last, smiling candidly.\u201cTruly\nI\u2019m glad you came--gladder than I can tell you.I was in the very slough\nof despond when you entered; and now--well, at least I\u2019m going to play\nthat I am out of it.\u201d\n\nJessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on\nhis shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m glad I came, too,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd very soon I want to\nsee you again--when you are quite free--and have a long, quiet talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, my girl,\u201d he answered, rising as well.The prospect seemed\nentirely attractive to him.He took her hand in his, and said again:\n\u201cAll right.And must you go now?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, mercy, yes!\u201d she exclaimed, with sudden recollection.\u201cI had no\nbusiness to stay so long!Perhaps you can tell me--or no--\u201d She vaguely\nput together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been\npartners, and seemed to be so no longer.\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I so poor a legal reputation as all that?\u201d he said, lightly\nsmiling.One\u2019s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their\nbad opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t about law,\u201d she explained, stum-blingly.Good-by for the time.\u201d\n\nHe would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently\nprevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.\u201cNot that,\u201d she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.And--good-by, Horace, for the\ntime.\u201d\n\nHe went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might\nsee her way down the stairs.When she had disappeared, he walked for\na little up and down the room, whistling softly to himself.It was\nundeniable that the world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only\na half-hour before.Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself\nwas a refreshing novelty.\u201cA damned decent sort of girl--considering everything!\u201d he mused aloud,\nas he locked up his desk for the day.CHAPTER XXXII.--THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.To come upon the street again was like the confused awakening from a\ndream.With the first few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an\nextremity of cold, yet still uncomfortably warm.A sudden passing spasm\nof giddiness, too, made her head swim so that for the instant she feared\nto fall.Then, with an added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and\ndesponding.The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she\nhad stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of\nself-reproach.The burning headache had returned, and with it came a\npained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in\nher to weakly dally in Horace\u2019s office when such urgent responsibility\nrested upon her outside.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.If the burden of this responsibility appeared\ntoo great for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so\nstrangely leaving her, there was all the more reason for her to set her\nteeth together, and press forward, even if she staggered as she went.The search had been made cruelly\nhopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness\nfor it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she\nought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers--a little\naway from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to court\nobservation.These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to her\nfeverish mind.She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of\nthem intended--which no doubt even now they were canvassing in furtive\nwhispers--and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless to find\nhim!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this\nanguish of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow\narrested her attention.It was a familiar enough figure--that of old\n\u201cCal\u201d Gedney; and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in\nthe fact that he was walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed\nintently on the sidewalk.He had passed again out of the range of her\ncursory glance before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and\neven some kind of a judge.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she\ncame up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that\nfor the moment she could not speak.The \u2019squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.\u201cLeave me alone, you hussy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cor I\u2019ll lock you up!\u201d\n\nHis misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind.\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish,\u201d\n she said, hurriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of perhaps life and death!Do you\nknow where Reuben Tracy is?Or can you tell me where I can find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t want to be bothered with _you_, wherever he is,\u201d was the surly\nresponse.\u201cBe off with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you it was a matter of life and death,\u201d she insisted, earnestly.\u201cHe\u2019ll never forgive you--you\u2019ll never forgive yourself--if you know and\nwon\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\nThe sincerity of the girl\u2019s tone impressed the old man.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.It was not easy\nfor him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was\nevidently clear enough.\u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d he asked, in a less unfriendly voice.Then\nhe added, in a reflective undertone: \u201cCur\u2019ous\u2019t I sh\u2019d want see Tracy,\ntoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you do know where he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s drove out to \u2019s mother\u2019s farm.You\u2019re one of that Lawton tribe, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?\u201d She asked the\nquestion with swift directness.She added in explanation, as he stared\nvacantly at her: \u201cI ask that because you said you wanted to see him,\nthat\u2019s all.I shall go alone if you won\u2019t come.He\u2019s _got_ to be back\nhere this evening, or God only knows what\u2019ll happen!I mean what I say!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the road?\u201d the \u2019squire asked, catching something of her\nown eager spirit.I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t tell me what your business is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this much,\u201d she whispered, hastily.\u201cThere is going to\nbe a mob at the Minster house to-night.A girl who knows one of the men\ntold--\u201d\n\nThe old \u2019squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with\nfierce energy.\u201cCome on--come on!\u201d he said, hoarsely.We\u2019ll gallop the horses both ways.\u201d He muttered to himself with\nexcitement as he dragged her along.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable\nperiod, while old \u201cCal\u201d was getting the horses--walking up and down the\npath in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily\nsuffering.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.When she conjured up before her frightened mind the\nterrible consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an\nintolerable hour of torture.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.There was even the evil chance that the old\nman had been refused the horses because he had been drinking.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the\nplank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then\nthe \u2019squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of\nrobes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into\nher own hands.\u201cLet me drive,\u201d she said, clucking the horses into a\nrapid trot.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.I\u2019m too ill to sit up, unless\nI\u2019m doing something that keeps me from giving up.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nReuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse\nto be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother\nEzra--a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now beside\nhim in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged feet\non the hearth, and a last week\u2019s agricultural paper on his knee.Ezra\nwas a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking\nat things, and considerable powers of expression.As a rule, the\nlawyer liked to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and\nsuggestions from the talk.But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of\nkeeping down the \u201cfidgets\u201d one of incredible difficulty.His mother--on\nwhose account he had been summoned--was so much better that Ezra\u2019s wife\nhad felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some much-needed\nrest.Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about the tariff\nduty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the dim-faced\nold wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o\u2019clock.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.The kerosene lamp\non the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light through its smoky\nchimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the stuffy air of the\nover-heated room.A ragged and strong-smelling old farm dog groaned\noffensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.Even the\ndraught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the stove\nand up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very futility\nof its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far\naway from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself\nwondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it.The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys\nof energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere\nsensation of living where it was really life--all went away, leaving\nnone but the Ezras behind.Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them\never came back.And the Ezras who remained on the farms--they seemed to\nshut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their\nown lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly\nin Reuben\u2019s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the\nMinsters.It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind\u2019s pendulum\nseparated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and\nbarren farmhouse room.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.And he, who had been born and reared in this\nlatter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single\nevening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other\nremoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.Curious slaves of habit--creatures of their surroundings--men were!A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his\nrevery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright\nrubbed them confusedly.\u201cNow I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,\u201d said Reuben, rising.\u201cIt\ncan\u2019t be the doctor this time of night, can it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt \u2019ud be jest like him,\u201d commented Ezra, captiously.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\u201cHe\u2019s a great\nhand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there\u2019s sickness in\nthe house.It all goes down in his bill.\u201d\n\nThe farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked\nheavily in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way.Some\nindistinct words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his\nhuge hairy hand, Ezra turned his head.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.\u201cSomebody to see you, Rube,\u201d he said.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.On second thought he added to the\nvisitor in a tone of formal politeness: \u201cWon\u2019t you step in, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\nJessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to\nhis invitation.But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change\ninto a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform.She\nstood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously\ntwitching.Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,\nshe trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,\nand fell inertly into Ezra\u2019s big, protecting arm.\u201cI guessed she was going to do it,\u201d said the farmer, not dissembling his\npride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and\nholding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph.\u201cHannah keeled over\nin that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of\nthe wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!\u201d\n\nReuben had hurriedly come to his brother\u2019s assistance.The two men\nplaced the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began\nwith anxious fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her\ngloves.Her fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now\nalmost equally cold, was covered with perspiration.Reuben rubbed her\nhands between his broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was\nthe right thing to do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for\nthe household bottle of brandy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit\nupon her whitened lips.She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar\nscene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer.Then\nshe smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.\u201cShe is an old friend of mine,\u201d whispered Reuben to his brother, as he\npressed the brandy once more upon her.It\nmust be something serious that brought her out here.\u201d\n\nThe girl languidly opened her eyes.\u201c\u2018Cal\u2019 Ged-ney\u2019s asleep in the\nsleigh,\u201d she murmured.He\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nIt was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while\nEzra hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her\nhead sank with utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the\nold-fashioned chair.Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety--once or twice holding\nthe lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what--until\nhis brother returned.Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and\nremained outside now to blanket them, while the old \u2019squire, benumbed\nand drowsy, found his way into the house.It was evident enough to the\nyoung lawyer\u2019s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.\u201cWell, what does this all mean?\u201d he demanded, with vexed asperity.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!\u201d\n said the \u2019squire.\u201cQuick--there ain\u2019t a minute to lose!\u201d The old man\nalmost gasped in his eagerness.Have you been to Cadmus?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and got my pocket full of affidavits.We can send all three of\nthem to prison fast enough.But that\u2019ll do to-morrow; for to-night\nthere\u2019s a mob up at the Minster place.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there._Look there!_\u201d\n\nThe old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside.He\nheld it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the\nreflection of a fire.it\u2019s the rolling mill,\u201d ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\u201cQuite as likely it\u2019s the Minster house; it\u2019s the same direction, only\nfarther off, and fires are deceptive,\u201d said Gedney, his excitement\nrising under the stimulus of the spectacle.Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said, working furiously at the laces.\u2019Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table as\nhe unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.The Lawton\ngirl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the\nMinsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find\nTracy.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in\nthe sleigh together.She had insisted upon driving, and as his long\njourney from Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the\nback seat and gone to sleep under the buffalo robes.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.He knew nothing\nmore until Ezra had roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a\nstandstill on the road outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica\ngone, the horses wet and shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky\nbehind them all ablaze.Looks as if the whole town was burning,\u201d said Ezra,\ncoming in as this recital was concluded.\u201cThem horses would a-got their\ndeath out there in another ten minutes.Guess I\u2019d better put \u2019em in\nthe barn, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no!I\u2019ve got to drive them back faster than\nthey came,\u201d said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat.\u201cHurry, and\nget me some thick gloves to drive in.I\u2019ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and\nlet me know how she is.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.Tell her I _had_ to go.\u201d\n\nWhen Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the\nfirst time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of\nthe girl in the rocking-chair.\u201cI\u2019ll get Hannah up,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cand she can have your room.I\nguess she\u2019s too sick to try to go back with you.If she\u2019s well enough,\nI\u2019ll bring her in in the morning.I was going to take in some apples,\nanyway.\u201d\n\nTo their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at\nthese words.\u201cNo,\u201d she said; \u201cI feel better now--much better.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.I really must.\u201d She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though\nshe was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile\nin imposing upon her unskilled companions.Perhaps if Hannah had been\n\u201cgot up\u201d she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and\ninsisted on having matters ordered otherwise.Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and\n\u2019Squire Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben\nimpatiently led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.\u201cNo; I\u2019d rather be in front with you,\u201d the girl said, when Reuben had\nspread the robes for her to sit in the back seat.\u201cLet the Judge sit\nthere; he wants to sleep.I\u2019m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.\u201d\n\nThus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,\nstarted the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.CHAPTER XXXIII.--PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.For some time there was no conversation in the sleigh.The horses sped\nevenly forward, with their heads well in the air, as if they too were\nexcited by the unnatural glare in the sky ahead.Before long there was\nadded to the hurried regular beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed\ntrack another sound--the snoring of the \u2019squire on the seat behind.There was a sense of melting in the air.Save where the intense glow\nof the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy\nluminance--fierce orange at the central base, and then through an\nexpanse of vermilion, rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull\nreddish purples--the heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds.A\npleasant, moist night-breeze came softly across the valley, bearing ever\nand again a solitary flake of snow.The effect of this mild wind was so\ngrateful to Jessica\u2019s face, now once more burning with an inner heat,\nthat she gave no thought to a curious difficulty in breathing which was\ngrowing upon her.\u201cThe scoundrels shall pay dear for this,\u201d Reuben said to her, between\nset teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be\nallowed to walk up hill.\u201cI\u2019m sure I hope so,\u201d she said, quite in his spirit.The husky note in her voice caught his attention.\u201cAre you sure you\nare bundled up warm enough?\u201d he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe\nhigher about her.I caught a heavy cold yesterday,\u201d she\nanswered.\u201cBut it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.\u201d\n\nIt struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip\nonce more to the horses: \u201cGod only knows what can be done when I do\nget there!\u201d It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be\nequal to any emergency--even an armed riot.There was something almost\ndisheartening in this confession of self-doubt.\u201cBut at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,\u201d he broke out,\nangrily, a moment later.\u201cDown to the last pennyweight we will have our\npound of flesh!My girl,\u201d he added, turning to look into her face, and\nspeaking with deep earnestness, \u201cI never knew what it was before to feel\nwholly merciless--absolutely without bowels of compassion.But I will\nnot abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains.I swear\nthat!\u201d\n\nBy an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction\nwithin her.\u201cThey feel very bitterly,\u201d she ventured to suggest.\u201cIt is\nterrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families\ndependent on that work for bare existence.And then the bringing in of\nthese strange workmen.I suppose that is what--\u201d\n\nReuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking of them,\u201d\n he said.\u201cPoor foolish fellows, I don\u2019t wish them any harm.I only\npray God they haven\u2019t done too much harm to themselves.No: it\u2019s the\nswindling scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief--_they_ are\nthe ones I\u2019ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.\u201d\n\nThe words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke\nfurther: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me\nto-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all\nthree of these ruffians to State prison.I haven\u2019t had time to\nexamine the papers yet, but he says he\u2019s got them in his pocket\nthere--affidavits from the original inventor of certain machinery, about\nits original sale, and from others who were a party to it--which makes\nthe whole fraud absolutely clear.I\u2019ll go over them to-night, when we\u2019ve\nseen this thing through\u201d--pointing vaguely with his whip toward the\nreddened sky--\u201cand if tomorrow I don\u2019t lay all three of them by the\nheels, you can have my head for a foot-ball!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand these things very well,\u201d said Jessica.\u201cWho is it\nyou mean?\u201d It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp\npain came in her breast now with almost every respiration.Her head", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "\u201cThere are three of them in the scheme,\u201d said the lawyer; \u201cas\ncold-blooded and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned.First, there\u2019s a New York man named Wendover--they call him a Judge--a\nsmart, subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one.Then there\u2019s\nSchuyler Tenney--perhaps you know who he is--he\u2019s a big hardware\nmerchant here; and with him in the swindle was--Good heavens!Why, I\nnever thought of it before!\u201d\n\nReuben had stopped short in his surprise.He began whipping the horses\nnow with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit\nglance toward his companion.\u201cIt\u2019s just occurred to me,\u201d he said.\u201cCurious--I hadn\u2019t given it a\nthought.Why, my girl, it\u2019s like a special providence.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.You, too, will\nhave your full revenge--such revenge as you never dreamt of.The third\nman is Horace Boyce!\u201d\n\nA great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl\u2019s reason as she took in\nthese words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been\nplunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were\nstill rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the\nvillage.The firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish\neffect like the northern lights.Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar,\nand the \u2019squire was steadily snoring behind them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.\u201cYou will send them all to prison--surely?\u201d she was able to ask.\u201cAs surely as God made little apples!\u201d was the sententious response.The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so\nterribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten.Only her\nthrobbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an\nawful need that she should think clearly!She bit her lips in tortured\nsilence, striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay\nhold upon something which should be of help.They had begun to descend the hill--a steep, uneven road full of drifts,\nbeyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the village\nitself--when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on the instant\nhad shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of resolution.She laid her hand on Reuben\u2019s arm.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll change into the back seat,\u201d she said, in a\nvoice which all her efforts could not keep from shaking.It\u2019ll be easier for me there.\u201d\n\nReuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her\nstrength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,\nand under the robe, into the rear seat.The \u2019squire was sunk in such a\nprofound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own half of\nthe space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled her\nwith so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed\nmiraculously to have returned to her.She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon\nherself, and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set\nherself about.This was nothing less than to secure the papers which\nthe old \u2019squire had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she\nremembered his having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his\ncoats.Slowly and deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat,\nand gently pushed aside the cloth until her hand might have free\npassage to and from the pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had\ndiscovered a bundle of thick papers to be resting.Then whole minutes\nseemed to pass before, having taken off her glove, she was able to draw\nthis packet out.Once during this operation Reuben half turned to speak\nto her, and her fright was very great.But she had had the presence of\nmind to draw the robe high about her, and answer collectedly, and he had\npalpably suspected nothing.As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his\ndrunken sleep.The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man\nup again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to\ndraw on and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had\ngained the outskirts of the village.She herself was breathing almost\nas heavily as the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was\ndone, lay back wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint\nand muscle, and a sickening dread in her mind lest there should be\nneither strength nor courage forthcoming for what remained to do.For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from\nwhom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened.At last,\nhowever, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed\nin the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted\nfrom the sidewalk, in response to Reuben\u2019s questions, sundry leading\nfacts of importance.A fire had started--probably incendiary--in the basement of the office\nof the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well gutted\nthe building.The firemen were still playing on the ruins.An immense\ncrowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he had\never seen in Thessaly.Where the money came from to buy so much drink,\nwas what puzzled him.The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some\nsaid they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a\n\u201chorning.\u201d He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the\nrheumatics if he stayed out any longer.Probably he would get them, as\nit was.Everybody said that the building was insured, and some folks\nhinted that the company had it set on fire themselves.Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt \u201cMuch\nobliged,\u201d and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of\nthe conflagration.The outer walls\nof the office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing\nwas left but a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground.Some firemen were inside the yard, but more were congregated about the\nwater-soaked space where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where\nhot coffee was being passed around to them.Here, too, there was a\nreport that the crowd had gone up to the Minster house.The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of\nhose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare\nstones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the\nstreams from the hydrants.Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash\nthem into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore\nonward toward the seminary road.At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben\ndeemed it prudent to draw up.There was evidently a considerable throng\nin the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the\nlawn within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came\ntherefrom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and\nrough jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly\nvisible assemblage.The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook\nold Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.\u201cHold these lines,\u201d he said, \u201cand wait here for me.--Or,\u201d he turned to\nJessica with the sudden thought, \u201cwould you rather he drove you home?\u201d\n\nThe girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body.At\nthe question she roused herself and shook her head.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.\u201cNo: let me stay\nhere,\u201d she said, wearily.But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to\nfree his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic\nstride in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit\nupright, and then to rise to her feet.\u201cYou\u2019d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn\u2019t come back\nright off,\u201d she said to the \u2019squire.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.\u201cI\u2019ll walk up and down,\u201d she answered, clambering with difficulty out of\nthe sleigh.\u201cI\u2019m tired of sitting still.\u201d\n\nOnce on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a\nfence-picket for support.The hand which she instinctively raised to her\nheart touched the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought\nwhich this inspired put new courage into her veins.With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon\nthe Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.CHAPTER XXXIV.--THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.Even before he reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon\nthe Minster lawn, Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and\ngathered that the people in the street outside were in the main peaceful\non-lookers, who did not understand very clearly what was going on, and\ndisapproved of the proceedings as far as they comprehended them.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.There\nwas a crowd inside the grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who\nwere out of work, but composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys\nand young hoodlums generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge\nin horseplay.There was a report that some sort of deputation had gone\nup on the doorstep and rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks\nto the occupants of the house; but that they had failed to get any\nanswer, and certainly the whole front of the residence was black as\nnight.Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to\nfollow him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the milk.Doubtless many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu\nprocession had it not been so hopelessly dark.The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his\nway up the gravelled path through the crowd.No special opposition was\noffered to his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only\nthose immediately affected knew anything about it.Although the path\nwas fairly thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing\nthere.Those who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a\njoke, the point of which was growing more and more obscure.Except for\nsome sporadic horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity\nof the assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered\namong them two or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last\nPresidential campaign, and a grotesque jack-o\u2019-lantem made of a pumpkin\nand elevated on a broom-stick.These urchins were running about among\nthe little groups of bystanders, knocking off one another\u2019s caps,\nshouting prodigiously, and having a good time.As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of\nthese lads raised the cry of \u201cHere\u2019s the coppers!\u201d and the crowd at\nthis seemed to close up with a simultaneous movement, while a murmur ran\nacross its surface like the wind over a field of corn.This sound was\none less of menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last\nsomething was going to happen.One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation,\nplaced himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the\nhead of the advancing group.This, drolly enough, lent the movement a\nsemblance of authority, or at least of significance, before which the\nmen more readily than ever gave way.At this the other boys with\nthe torches and jack-o\u2019-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy\u2019s\nimmediate supporters, and they in turn were followed by the throng\ngenerally.Thus whimsically escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of\nthe mansion.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here,\nsome of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything\nwas, Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least\nvisibly responsible for this strange gathering.Presumably they were\ntaken by surprise at his appearance with such a following.At any\nrate, they, too, offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the\nplatform of the steps without difficulty.Then he turned and whispered\nto a friend to have the boys with the torches also come up.This was\na suggestion gladly obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the\nlow-comedy pumpkin, whose illumination created a good-natured laugh.Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng.The\ngathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds\nthat the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form.Then there were\nadmonitory shouts here and there, under the influence of which the\nhorn-blowing gradually ceased, and Tracy\u2019s name was passed from mouth to\nmouth until its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer\non the outskirts of the crowd.In answer to this two or three hostile\ninterrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor\nthese, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.\u201cMy friends,\u201d he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his\nvoice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of \u201clouder!\u201d rose\nfrom the darkness of the central lawn.\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of waking the fine ladies,\u201d called out an anonymous voice.\u201cShut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,\u201d was another shout.\u201cBegorrah, it\u2019s the pumpkin that _is_ talkin\u2019 now!\u201d cried a shrill third\nvoice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.\u201cMy friends,\u201d began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without\nimmediate interruption, \u201calthough I don\u2019t know precisely why you have\ngathered here at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to\nsay to you which I think you will regard as important.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.I have not seen\nthe persons who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily\nunderstand that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them\nsome anxiety, I am sure that they, when they come to understand it,\nwill be as glad as I am that you _are_ here, and that I am given this\nopportunity of speaking for them to you.If you had not taken this\nnotion of coming here tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you\nto meet me somewhere else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters\nover.\u201cFirst of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened\npromptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken\nabout the law, the rolling mills too.I give you my word for that, as\nthe legal representative of two of these women.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; they\u2019ll be opened with the Frenchmen!\u201d came a swift answering\nshout.\u201cOr will you get Chinamen?\u201d cried another, amid derisive laughter.Reuben responded in his clearest tones: \u201cNo man who belongs to Thessaly\nshall be crowded out by a newcomer.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.I give you my word for that, too.\u201d\n\nSome scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised\nfor the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the\nprevalent anxiety to hear more.In this momentary interval Reuben caught\nthe sound of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the\nfront door, and guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new\nauditor might be.\u201cSecondly,\u201d he went on, \u201cyou ought to be told the truth about the\nshutting down of the furnaces and the lockout.These women were not at\nall responsible for either action.I know of my own knowledge that both\nthings caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond\nmeasure at the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to\nundersell and drive away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen.I\nwant you to realize this, because otherwise you would do a wrong in your\nminds to these good women who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our\nvillage and its people as any other soul within its borders, and who,\nfor their own sake as well as that of Stephen Minster\u2019s memory, deserve\nrespect and liking at your hands.\u201cI may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in\nwhom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power\nto these unworthy men.The result was a series of steps which they\ndeplored, but did not know how to stop.A few days ago I was called\ninto the case to see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from\nwhich they, and you, and the townspeople generally, suffer.Since then I\nhave been hard at work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can\nsay with authority that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to\nimpoverish you will be beaten all along the line.\u201d\n\nThis time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged.When\nit died away, some voice called out, \u201cThree cheers for the ladies!\u201d and\nthese were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o\u2019-lantem boy,\nwho waved his pumpkin vigorously.\u201cOne word more,\u201d called out Tracy, \u201cand I hope you will take in good\npart what I am going to say.When I made my way up through the grounds,\nI was struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come\nhere.I gather now that word was passed around during the day that there\nwould be a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what,\nwould be done after they got here.I do not know who started the idea,\nor who circulated the word.It might be worth your while to find out.Meanwhile, don\u2019t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and\nuncivil way of going at the thing?This is a free country, but just\nbecause it _is_ free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one\nanother\u2019s rights.There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a\ncitizen, or rather a subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or\njoin a riot.But here there ought to be no mob; there should be no room\nfor even thought of a riot.Our very strength lies in the idea that we\nare our own policemen--our own soldiery.I say this not because one in\na hundred of you meant any special harm in coming here, but because the\nnotion of coming itself was not American.Beware of men who suggest that\nkind of thing.Beware of men who preach the theory that because you are\npuddlers or moulders or firemen, therefore you are different from the\nrest of your fellow-citizens.I, for one, resent the idea that because I\nam a lawyer, and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong\nto different classes.I wish with all my heart that everybody resented\nit, and that that abominable word \u2018classes\u2019 could be wiped out of the\nEnglish language as it is spoken in America.I am glad if\nyou feel easier in your minds than you did when you came.If you do,\nI guess there\u2019s been no harm done by your coming which isn\u2019t more than\nbalanced by the good that has come out of it.Only next time, if you\ndon\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll have our meeting somewhere else, where it will be\neasier to speak than it is in a snowstorm, and where we won\u2019t keep our\nneighbors awake.And now good-night, everybody.\u201d\n\nOut of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd\nat this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:\n\n\u201cGive us the names of the men who, you say, _were_ responsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that to-night.But if you read the next list of\nindictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a\nlawyer you\u2019ll find them all there.\u201d\n\nThe loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there\nwas a sustained roar when Tracy\u2019s name was shouted out above the tumult.Some few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many\nothers called out to him a personal \u201cgood-night.\u201d The last of those to\nshake the accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their\nsteps homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had\nsuddenly become illuminated.Thus Reuben\u2019s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been\nplanned to be a mob was accomplished.It is remembered to this day as\nthe best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is\nalways spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence.But he himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded\nbecause the better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him\nto succeed, and because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and\nbright-witted lot of men with the idea that he wasn\u2019t a humbug.*****\n\nAt the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success.His hair was\nstreaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore,\nand the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great\nexcitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway\nopened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the\nservant on the threshold, said: \u201cWe want you to come in, Mr.Tracy,\u201d he\nturned mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort\nand a chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of\nhis speech to the crowd.The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to\nall his senses.He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of\nclaret which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the\ndrawing-room and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth,\nso very happy, that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears\nin his eyes.It seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart--the\nanger, and fright, and terrible anxiety--had lasted for whole weary\nyears.Trial by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through\nwhich he had passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and\nmental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the\nbeautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice.The liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones\nwhich wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of\nshining white robes and celestial harps--an indefinitely glorious\nrecompense for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow\nof death.Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright\nspell by speech.\u201cWe heard almost every word of what you said,\u201d Kate was saying.\u201cWhen\nyou began we were in this room, crouched there by the window--that is,\nEthel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen--and at\nfirst we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your\nvoice.That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if _I_ should have\nbeen---at least, equally quick to know it--that is, I mean, I\u2019ve heard\nyou speak so much more than she has.And then we both hurried up-stairs,\nand lifted the window--and oh!\u201cAnd from the moment we knew it was you--that you were here--we felt\nperfectly safe.It doesn\u2019t seem now that we were very much afraid, even\nbefore that, although probably we were.There was a lot of hooting, and\nthat dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang the\ndoor-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done.So\nI daresay they only wanted to scare us.Of course it was the fire that\nmade us really nervous.We got that brave girl\u2019s warning about the mob\u2019s\ncoming here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the\nblaze; and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl?\u201cHere it is,\u201d answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her\nbosom, and reading aloud:\n\n\u201cDear Miss Minster:\n\n\u201cI have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night\nto do violent things.I am starting out to try and bring you help.Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to\ndo.\u201cGratefully yours,\n\n\u201cJessica Lawton.\u201d\n\nReuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.\u201cI am ashamed of myself,\u201d he said; \u201cI\u2019ve left her out there all this\nwhile.There was so much else that really she\nescaped my memory altogether.\u201d\n\nHe had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.\u201cYou will come back, won\u2019t you?\u201d Kate asked.\u201cThere are so many things\nto talk over, with all of us.And--and bring her too, if--if she will\ncome.\u201d\n\nWith a sign of acquiescence and comprehension.Reuben darted down the\nsteps and into the darkness.In a very few minutes he returned,\ndisappointment written all over his face.Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off\nas soon as I had got out of sight.I had offered to have him drive her\nhome, but she refused.She\u2019s a curiously independent girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d said Kate.\u201cBut I will go over the first thing in the\nmorning and thank her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,\u201d\n put in the lawyer.\u201cI don\u2019t mean that it was so great a thing--my\ncoming--but she drove all the way out to my mother\u2019s farm to bring me\nhere to-night, and fainted when she got there.If\nher father is still here, I think he\u2019d better go at once to her place,\nand see about her.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben\nLawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as\nthe responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the\nhallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank\nface.He assented with readiness to Reuben\u2019s idea, when it was explained to\nhim.\u201cSo she druv out to your mother\u2019s place for you, did she?\u201d he commented,\nadmiringly.\u201cThat girl\u2019s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,\u201d he\nadded, with an apologetic smile, \u201cof the old, old block.I ain\u2019t got so\nmuch git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a\nregular snorter!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.Lawton,\u201d said\nKate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.\u201cBe sure that you tell your\ndaughter, too, how grateful we all are.\u201d\n\nBen took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it\nwith formal awkwardness.\u201cI didn\u2019t seem to do much,\u201d he said, deprecatingly, \u201cand perhaps I\nwouldn\u2019t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin\u2019\nand gougin\u2019 and wras\u2019lin\u2019 round generally.But you can bet your boots,\nma\u2019am, that I\u2019d a-done what I could!\u201d\n\nWith this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps\nwith a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume\nbefore.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of\ncharmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,\nand then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.\u201cIf you will give me your arm,\u201d she said, in a delicious murmur, \u201cwe\nwill go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us\nthere.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have\none to-night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.The scene which opened upon Reuben\u2019s eyes was like a vista of\nfairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold\nframes and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,\ncontributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of\nthe table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which\nfell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and\nsoftened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished\ngleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues\nfrom the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here\nwhich gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,\nand fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which\ncan make the breaking of bread a poem.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or\ntwice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was\nin his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably\nhis future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted\npath--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even\nentertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward\nto self-possession.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and\nthereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them\nto be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something\ndisconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the\nreflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced\nbreathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd\noutside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.Minster, who sat at\nthe head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica\u2019s ride, of her\nfainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this\nhe drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he\nhad sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the\nmorning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he\nwould summarily take.Minster,\u201d he concluded, when the servant\nhad again left the room, \u201cno real loss will result from this whole\nimbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared\nup; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly\nManufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority\ninterest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not\nentirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that\nyou will come out winner.\u201d\n\nMrs.\u201cMy daughters thought that I knew\nnothing about business!\u201d she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the\nmatter undiscussed.\u201cAnd will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?\u201d asked Ethel,\nfrom Reuben\u2019s right.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his\nbitterness had evaporated.\u201cMen ought to be punished for such a crime as\nthey committed,\u201d he said.\u201cIf only as a duty to the public, they should\nbe prosecuted.\u201d\n\nHe was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes\nmet, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:\n\n\u201cOf course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself\nwith the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I\nwas full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to\nbe punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even\ntell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage\nin settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand\njury.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a consideration which we won\u2019t discuss,\u201d said Kate.\u201cIf my mind\nwere clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the\ndecision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking\na great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce\nwas, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I know.\u201d Reuben bowed his head gravely.\u201cWell, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous\nyoungster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits\ncame to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d urged Kate.He was weak,\nfoolish, vain--whatever you like.But I\ndon\u2019t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had\nany idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,\u201d\n the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, \u201cto be frank, there are\nreasons for my thinking so.\u201d\n\nReuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful\ninflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and\nmirrored that feeling in his glance.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.\u201cIt is my notion that he was deceived, at\nthe beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,\u201d responded\nKate.\u201cAnd that is why,\u201d put in Ethel, \u201cwe feel like asking you not to take\nthe matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.It would\nbe too dreadful to think of--to take a man", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "No; we mustn\u2019t do that, Mr.Tracy.\u201d\n\nKate added musingly: \u201cHe has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,\ncan we not?\u201d\n\nThen Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except \u201cyes.\u201d\n His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover\u2019s interpretation of this\nspeech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words\nabout allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a\nfinal decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the\ntable knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the\natmosphere grew lighter.\u201cAnd now for the real thing,\u201d said Kate, gayly.\u201cI am commissioned on\nbehalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our\nrescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in\nthe library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were\nin such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn\u2019t tell her when you\nbegan--but she couldn\u2019t help hearing the horns, and she is as much\nobliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d assented Mrs.\u201cI don\u2019t know where the police\nwere, at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police could have done next to nothing, if they had been\nhere,\u201d said Reuben.\u201cThe visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and\ndiscreditable in its way, but I don\u2019t really imagine there was ever any\nactual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works\nand the importation of the French Canadians, and I don\u2019t blame them;\nbut as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.My own notion is\nthat the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve\nin frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with itself.The truth is, that the mob isn\u2019t an American\ninstitution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals\nto reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they\nwere quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.\u201d\n\n\u201cEthel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened\npromptly,\u201d said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might\nmean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: \u201cYes, Mrs.And so they must\nbe opened, on Monday.It is my dearest\nwish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to\nmake a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we\nshould defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it\ncan.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and\nwho can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not\ndare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian\nof your interests quite as much as of your daughters\u2019.I am very proud\nand happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for\nacting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot\nnow be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,\u201d said Ethel,\nmerrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their\nconsiderable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been\nbrought around.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,\nwas gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There\nhad been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly\nalong, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt\nthat he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that\nwere past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to\nminister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of\nattention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the\nfamily had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy\nhad surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary\nto keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one\nanother, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent\nthan spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.The outside world\nhad shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened\nlight was home.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,\nof romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it\nwas centred.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark\nupon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of\nsmiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely\nprompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone\naway, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He\nheld her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed\nhis lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect\nagain, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel\u2019s\nface, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal\ndreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,\ntrembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down\nthe path to the street.bless you!\u201d was what the song-birds\ncarolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had\nsaid, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his\nprogress.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the\nether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was\nthere ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the\nuniverse?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air\nwas colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of\nwinter.To the lover\u2019s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely\nnearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which\nthey burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked\nthemselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward\nglide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was\napparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified\nonward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****\n\nAt the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a\nneighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow\nwhich lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,\nand he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama\nspread overhead.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his\ncane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and\nhis brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he\npassed, \u201cHello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d and had only\nan inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories\nof impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and\nGeneral Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That\nHorace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only\ntoo evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal\nroof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but\nindulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and\nquip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him\nlike a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful\nweakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and\nto their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked\ndisgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but\nwinks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when\nhe came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very\nvagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path\nwhich encircled the small yard to reach the front door.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.He cursorily\nnoted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the\nsnow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out\nlate.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the\nlower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which\ngave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,\nobviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and\narms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an\ninstant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped\nit, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the\nreverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,\nunlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up\nthe gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very\nill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for\nDr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--\u201cI TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!\u201d\n\n Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed\nby stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet\nvolatile sense of comfort.Jessica\u2019s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a\ngigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no\nimpression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the\nslightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it\nfinally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink\nleaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward\nunderstanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness\nbefore her vacantly contented vision.Upon all sides the outer leaves\ngradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still\ndownward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted\nlily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely\napparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered\nover these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came\nthrough them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at\nits disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her\ndim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.It seemed\nweeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her\nwas the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending\nfrom it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at\nit.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at\nall.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of\na man\u2019s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,\nand thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not\nto be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light\nflashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face\nwas standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her.She\nknew that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised\nthat he should be there.The capacity for wondering, for thinking about\nthings, seemed not to exist in her brain.She looked at him calmly and\ndid not dream of speaking.\u201cAre you better?\u201d she heard him eagerly whisper.\"High place to thee in royal court,\n      High place in battled[88] line,\n    Good hawk and hound for silvan

on the ear,\n    The clan's shrill Gathering they could hear;\n    Those thrilling sounds, that call the might\n    Of old Clan-Alpine to the fight.Thick beat the rapid notes, as when\n    The mustering hundreds shake the glen,\n    And, hurrying at the signal dread,\n    The batter'd earth returns their tread.Then prelude light, of livelier tone,\n    Express'd their merry marching on,\n    Ere peal of closing battle rose,\n    With mingled outcry, shrieks, and blows;\n    And mimic din of stroke and ward,\n    As broadsword upon target jarr'd;\n    And groaning pause, ere yet again,\n    Condensed, the battle yell'd amain;\n    The rapid charge, the rallying shout,\n    Retreat borne headlong into rout,\n    And bursts of triumph, to declare\n    Clan-Alpine's conquests--all were there.Nor ended thus the strain; but slow,\n    Sunk in a moan prolong'd and low,\n    And changed the conquering clarion swell,\n    For wild lament o'er those that fell.The war pipes ceased; but

in speed the mountaineer:\n    Right up Ben-Lomond could he press,\n    And not a sob his toil confess.His form accorded with a mind\n    Lively and ardent, frank and kind;\n    A blither heart, till Ellen came,\n    Did never love nor sorrow tame;\n    It danced as lightsome in his breast,\n    As play'd the feather on his crest.Yet friends, who nearest knew the youth,\n    His scorn of wrong, his zeal for truth,\n    And bards, who saw his features bold,\n    When kindled by the tales of old,\n    Said, were that youth to manhood grown,\n    Not long should Roderick Dhu's renown\n    Be foremost voiced by mountain fame,\n    But quail to that of Malcolm Graeme.Now back they wend their watery way,\n    And, \"O my sire!\"did Ellen say,\n    \"Why urge thy chase so far astray?And

messenger delivered the symbol and the name of\nthe rendezvous to the principal personage, who immediately forwarded\nthem by a fresh messenger.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football there.In this way the signal for gathering was\ndisseminated throughout the territory of a large clan in a surprisingly\nshort space of time.The summer dawn's reflected hue\n    To purple changed Loch Katrine blue;\n    Mildly and soft the western breeze\n    Just kiss'd the lake, just stirr'd the trees;\n    And the pleased lake, like maiden coy,\n    Trembled but dimpled not for joy;\n    The mountain shadows on her breast\n    Were neither broken nor at rest;\n    In bright uncertainty they lie,\n    Like future joys to Fancy's eye.The water lily to the light\n    Her chalice rear'd of silver bright;\n    The doe awoke, and to the lawn,\n    Begemm'd with dewdrops, led her fawn;\n    The gray mist left the mountain side,\n    The torrent show'd its glistening pride;\n    Invisible in flecked sky,\n    The lark sent down her revelry;\n    The blackbird and the speckled thrush\n    Good-morrow gave from brake and bush;\n    In answer coo'd the cushat dove\n    Her notes of peace, and rest, and love.No thought of peace, no thought of rest,\n    Assuaged the storm in Roderick's breast.With sheathed broadsword in his hand,\n    Abrupt he paced the islet strand,\n    And eyed the rising sun, and laid\n    His hand on his impatient blade.Beneath a rock, his vassals' care\n    Was prompt the ritual[167] to prepare,\n    With deep and deathful meaning fraught;\n    For such Antiquity had taught\n    Was preface meet, ere yet abroad\n    The Cross of Fire should take its road.The shrinking band stood oft aghast\n    At the impatient glance he cast;--\n    Such glance the mountain eagle threw,\n    As, from the cliffs of Benvenue,\n    She spread her dark sails on the wind,\n    And, high in middle heaven reclined,\n    With her broad shadow on the lake,\n    Silenced the warblers of the brake.[167] The ritual or religious ceremony with which the Fiery Cross was\nmade.A heap of wither'd boughs was piled,\n    Of juniper and rowan[168] wild,\n    Mingled with shivers from the oak,\n    Rent by the lightning's recent stroke.Brian, the Hermit, by it stood,\n    Barefooted, in his frock and hood.[169]\n    His grisled beard and matted hair\n    Obscured a visage of despair;\n    His naked arms and legs, seamed o'er,\n    The scars of frantic penance bore.That monk, of savage form and face,\n    The impending danger of his race\n    Had drawn[170] from deepest solitude,\n    Far in Benharrow's[171] bosom rude.Not his the mien of Christian priest,\n    But Druid's,[172] from the grave released,\n    Whose hardened heart and eye might brook\n    On human sacrifice to look;\n    And much, 'twas said, of heathen lore,\n    Mixed in the charms he muttered o'er.The hallow'd creed gave only worse\n    And deadlier emphasis of curse;\n    No peasant sought that Hermit's prayer,\n    His cave the pilgrim shunn'd with care,\n    The eager huntsman knew his bound,\n    And in mid-chase called off his hound;\n    Or if, in lonely glen or strath,\n    The desert dweller met his path,\n    He pray'd, and signed the cross between,\n    While terror took devotion's mien.[169] \"Frock and hood,\" i.e., the usual garments of monks or hermits.[170] \"That monk,\" etc., i.e., the impending danger... had drawn that\nmonk, etc.[171] A mountain near the head of Loch Lomond.[172] The Druids were the priests among the ancient Celtic nations\nin Gaul

fold,[173]\n    Built deep within a dreary glen,\n    Where scatter'd lay the bones of men,\n    In some forgotten battle slain,\n    And bleach'd by drifting wind and rain.It might have tamed a warrior's heart,\n    To view such mockery of his art!The knot-grass fetter'd there the hand,\n    Which once could burst an iron band;\n    Beneath the broad and ample bone,\n    That buckler'd heart to fear unknown,\n    A feeble and a timorous guest,\n    The field-fare[174] framed her lowly nest;\n    There the slow blind-worm left his slime\n    On the fleet limbs that mock'd at time;\n    And there, too, lay the leader's skull,\n    Still wreathed with chaplet, flush'd and full,\n    For heath-bell, with her purple bloom,\n    Supplied the bonnet and the plume.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.All night, in this sad glen, the maid\n    Sate, shrouded in her mantle's shade:\n    --She said, no shepherd sought her side,\n    No hunter's hand her snood untied,\n    Yet ne'er again, to braid her hair,\n    The virgin snood did Alice wear;\n    Gone was her maiden glee and sport,\n    Her maiden girdle all too short;\n    Nor sought she, from that fatal night,\n    Or holy church, or blessed rite,\n    But lock'd her secret in her breast,\n    And died in travail, unconfess'd.Alone, among his young compeers,\n    Was Brian from his infant years;\n    A moody and heart-broken boy,\n    Estranged from sympathy and joy,\n    Bearing each taunt which careless tongue\n    On his mysterious lineage flung.Whole nights he spent by moonlight pale,\n    To wood and stream his hap to wail,\n    Till, frantic, he as truth received\n    What of his birth the crowd believed,\n    And sought, in mist and meteor fire,\n    To meet and know his Phantom Sire!In vain, to soothe his wayward fate,\n    The cloister oped her pitying gate;\n    In vain, the learning of the age\n    Unclasp'd the sable-lettered[175] page;\n    Even in its treasures he could find\n    Food for the fever of his mind.Eager he read whatever tells\n    Of magic, cabala,[176] and spells,\n    And every dark pursuit allied\n    To curious and presumptuous pride;\n    Till, with fired brain and nerves o'erstrung,\n    And heart with mystic horrors wrung,\n    Desperate he sought Benharrow's den,\n    And hid him from the haunts of men.[175] Black letter, the name of the Old English or modern Gothic\nletters used in old manuscript and early printed books.The desert gave him visions wild,\n    Such as might suit the specter's child.Where with black cliffs the torrents toil,\n    He watch'd the wheeling eddies boil,\n    Till, from their foam, his dazzled eyes\n    Beheld the River Demon[177] rise;\n    The mountain mist took form and limb,\n    Of noontide hag, or goblin grim;\n    The midnight wind came wild and dread,\n    Swell'd with the voices of the dead;\n    Far on the future battle heath\n    His eye beheld the ranks of death:\n    Thus the lone Seer, from mankind hurl'd,\n    Shaped forth a disembodied world.One lingering sympathy of mind\n    Still bound him to the mortal kind;\n    The only parent he could claim\n    Of ancient Alpine's lineage came.Late had he heard, in prophet's dream,\n    The fatal Ben-Shie's[178] boding scream;\n    Sounds,[179] too, had come in midnight blast,\n    Of charging steeds, careering fast\n    Along Benharrow's shingly side,\n    Where mortal horseman ne'er might ride;\n    The thunderbolt had split the pine,--\n    All augur'd ill to Alpine's line.He girt his loins, and came to show\n    The signals of impending woe,\n    And now stood prompt to bless or ban,[180]\n    As bade the Chieftain of his clan.[177] A malicious spirit supposed by the superstitious Scotch people to\ninhabit lakes and rivers, and to forebode calamity.[178] A fairy supposed to indicate coming death or disaster by her\nlamentations.[179] Sounds of the same foreboding character.'Twas all prepared;[181]--and from the rock,\n    A goat, the patriarch of the flock,\n    Before the kindling pile was laid,\n    And pierced by Roderick's ready blade.Patient the sickening victim eyed\n    The lifeblood ebb in crimson tide,\n    Down his clogg'd beard and shaggy limb,\n    Till darkness glazed his eyeballs dim.The grisly priest, with murmuring prayer,\n    A slender crosslet form'd with care,\n    A cubit's[182] length in measure due;\n    The shaft and limbs were rods of yew,\n    Whose parents in Inch-Cailliach[183] wave\n    Their shadows o'er Clan-Alpine's grave,\n    And, answering Lomond's breezes deep,\n    Soothe many

step and fiery look,\n    On high their naked brands they shook,\n    Their clattering targets wildly strook;[184]\n      And first in murmur low,\n    Then, like the billow in his course,\n    That far to seaward finds his source,\n    And flings to shore his muster'd force,\n    Burst, with loud roar, their answer hoarse,\n      \"Woe to the traitor, woe!\"Ben-an's gray scalp the accents knew,[185]\n    The joyous wolf from covert drew,\n    The exulting eagle scream'd afar,--\n    They knew the voice of Alpine's war.[185] \"Scalp,\" etc., i.e., summit the accents heard.X.\n\n    The shout was hush'd on lake and fell,\n    The monk resumed his mutter'd spell:\n    Dismal and low its accents came,\n    The while he scathed[186] the Cross with flame;\n    And the few words that reach'd the air,\n    Although the holiest name was there,\n    Had more of blasphemy than prayer.But when he shook above the crowd\n    Its kindled points, he spoke aloud:--\n    \"Woe to the wretch who fails to rear\n    At this dread sign the ready spear!For, as the flames this symbol sear,\n    His home, the refuge of his fear,\n      A kindred fate shall know;\n    Far o'er its roof the volumed flame\n    Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim,\n    While maids and matrons on his name\n    Shall call down wretchedness and shame,\n      And infamy and woe.\"Then rose the cry of females, shrill\n    As goshawk's whistle on the hill,\n    Denouncing[187] misery and ill,\n    Mingled with childhood's babbling trill\n      Of curses stammer'd slow;\n    Answering, with imprecation dread,\n    \"Sunk be his home in embers red!And cursed be the meanest shed\n    That e'er shall hide the houseless head,\n      We doom to want and woe!\"A sharp and shrieking echo

sign\" of\nthe Fiery Cross.[188] A ravine of Benvenue supposed to be haunted by evil spirits.[189] The Pass of the Cattle, above Coir-Uriskin.Then deeper paused the priest anew,\n    And hard his laboring breath he drew,\n    While, with set teeth and clinched hand,\n    And eyes that glow'd like fiery brand,\n    He meditated curse more dread,\n    And deadlier, on the clansman's head,\n    Who, summon'd to his Chieftain's aid,\n    The signal saw and disobeyed.The crosslet's points of sparkling wood\n    He quenched among the bubbling blood,\n    And, as again the sign he rear'd,\n    Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard:\n    \"When flits this Cross from man to man,\n    Vich-Alpine's summons to his clan,\n    Burst be the ear that fails to heed!Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!May ravens tear the careless eyes,\n    Wolves make the coward heart their prize!As sinks that blood stream in the earth,\n    So may his heart's blood drench his hearth!As dies in hissing gore

right hand high the crosslet bore,\n    His left the poleax grasp'd, to guide\n    And stay his footing in the tide.He stumbled twice--the foam splash'd high,\n    With hoarser swell the stream raced by;\n    And had he fall'n,--forever there,\n    Farewell Duncraggan's orphan heir!But still, as if in parting life,\n    Firmer he grasp'd the Cross of strife,\n    Until the opposing bank he

that in measures vied\n    Before the young and bonny bride,\n    Whose downcast eye and cheek disclose\n    The tear and blush of morning rose.With virgin step, and bashful hand,\n    She held the kerchief's snowy band;\n    The gallant bridegroom, by her side,\n    Beheld his prize with victor's pride,\n    And the glad mother in her ear\n    Was closely whispering word of cheer.[204] Tombea

from the recent flood,\n    Panting and travel-soil'd he stood,\n    The fatal sign of fire and sword\n    Held forth, and spoke the appointed word:\n    \"The muster-place is Lanrick mead--\n

hope deferr'd,\n    And memory, with a torturing train\n    Of all his morning visions vain.Mingled with love's impatience, came\n    The manly thirst for martial fame;\n    The stormy joy of mountaineers,\n    Ere yet they rush upon the spears;\n    And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning,\n    And hope, from well-fought field returning,\n    With war's red honors on his crest,\n    To clasp his Mary to his breast.Stung by such thoughts, o'er bank and brae,\n    Like fire from flint he glanced away,\n    While high resolve, and feeling strong,\n    Burst into voluntary song.The

hand\n    Could hardly buckle on his brand,\n    To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow\n    Were yet scarce terror to the crow.Each valley, each sequester'd glen,\n    Muster'd its little horde of men,\n    That met as torrents from the height\n    In Highland dales their streams unite,\n    Still gathering, as they pour along,\n    A voice more loud, a tide more strong,\n    Till at the rendezvous they stood\n    By hundreds prompt for blows and blood;\n    Each train'd to arms since life began,\n    Owning no tie but to his clan,\n    No oath, but by his Chieftain's hand,\n    No law, but Roderick Dhu's command.[208] Blaze of the heather, which is often set on fire by the shepherds\nto facilitate a growth of young herbage for the sheep.That summer morn had Roderick Dhu\n    Survey'd the skirts of Benvenue,\n    And sent his scouts o'er hill and heath,\n    To view the frontiers of Menteith.All backward came with news of truce;\n    Still lay each martial Graeme[210] and Bruce,[211]\n    In Rednock[212] courts no horsemen wait,\n    No banner waved on Cardross[213] gate,\n    On Duchray's[214] towers no beacon shone,\n    Nor scared the herons from Loch Con;\n    All seemed at peace.--Now wot ye why\n    The Chieftain, with such anxious eye,\n    Ere to the muster he repair,\n    This western frontier scann'd with care?--\n    In Benvenue's most darksome cleft,\n    A fair, though cruel, pledge was left;\n    For Douglas, to his promise true,\n    That morning from the isle withdrew,\n    And in a deep sequester'd dell\n    Had sought a low and lonely cell.By many a bard, in Celtic tongue,\n    Has Coir-nan-Uriskin[215] been sung;\n    A softer name the Saxons gave,\n    And called the grot the Goblin-cave.[210] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1,

Note 1, p.It was a wild and strange retreat,\n    As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet.The dell, upon the mountain's crest,\n    Yawn'd like a gash on warrior's breast;\n    Its trench had stayed full many a rock,\n    Hurl'd by primeval earthquake shock\n    From Benvenue's gray summit wild,\n    And here, in random ruin piled,\n    They frown'd incumbent o'er the spot,\n    And form'd the rugged silvan grot.The oak and birch, with mingled shade,\n    At noontide there a twilight made,\n    Unless when short and sudden shone\n    Some straggling beam on cliff or stone,\n    With such a glimpse as prophet's eye\n    Gains on thy depth, Futurity.No murmur waked the solemn still,[216]\n    Save tinkling of a fountain rill;\n    But when the wind chafed with the lake,\n    A sullen sound would upward break,\n    With dashing hollow voice, that spoke\n    The incessant war of wave and rock.Suspended cliffs, with hideous sway,\n    Seem'd nodding o'er the cavern gray.From such a den the wolf had sprung,\n    In such the wild-cat leaves her young;\n    Yet Douglas and his daughter fair\n    Sought for a space their safety there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.Gray Superstition's whisper dread\n    Debarr'd the spot to vulgar tread;\n    For there, she said, did fays resort,\n    And satyrs[217] hold their silvan court,\n    By moonlight tread their mystic maze,\n    And blast the rash beholder's gaze.[217] Silvan deities of Greek mythology, with head and body of a man\nand legs of a goat.Now eve, with western shadows long,\n    Floated on Katrine bright and strong,\n    When Roderick, with a chosen few,\n    Repass'd the heights of Benvenue.Above the Goblin-cave they go,\n    Through the wild pass of Beal-nam-bo:\n    The prompt retainers speed before,\n    To launch the shallop from the shore,\n    For 'cross Loch Katrine lies his way\n    To view the passes of Achray,\n    And place his clansmen in array.Yet lags the Chief in musing mind,\n    Unwonted sight, his men behind.A single page, to bear his sword,\n    Alone attended on his lord;\n    The rest their way through thickets break,\n    And soon await him by the lake.It was a fair and gallant sight,\n    To view them from the neighboring height,\n    By the low-level'd sunbeam's light!For strength and stature, from the clan\n    Each warrior was a chosen man,\n    As even afar might well be seen,\n    By their proud step and martial mien.Their feathers dance, their tartans float,\n    Their targets gleam, as by the boat\n    A wild and warlike group they stand,\n    That well became such mountain strand.Their Chief, with step reluctant, still\n    Was lingering on the craggy hill,\n    Hard by where turn'd apart the road\n    To Douglas's obscure abode.It was but with that dawning morn,\n    That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn\n    To drown his love in war's wild roar,\n    Nor think of Ellen Douglas more;\n    But he who stems[218] a stream with sand,\n    And fetters flame with flaxen band,\n    Has yet a harder task to prove--\n    By firm resolve to conquer love!Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost,\n    Still hovering near his treasure lost;\n    For though his haughty heart deny\n    A parting meeting to his eye,\n    Still fondly strains his anxious ear,\n    The accents of her voice to hear,\n    And inly did he curse the breeze\n    That waked to sound the rustling trees.It is the harp of Allan-Bane,\n    That wakes its measure slow and high,\n    Attuned to sacred minstrelsy.'Tis Ellen, or an angel, sings._Ave Maria!_[219] maiden mild!Thou canst hear though from the wild,\n      Thou canst save amid despair.Safe may we sleep beneath thy care,\n      Though banish'd, outcast, and reviled--\n    Maiden!_Ave Maria!_\n\n    _Ave Maria!_ undefiled!The flinty couch we now must share\n    Shall seem with down of eider[220] piled,\n      If thy protection hover there.The murky cavern's heavy air\n      Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled;\n    Then, Maiden!_Ave Maria!_\n\n    _Ave Maria!_ stainless styled!Foul demons of the earth and air,\n    From this their wonted haunt exiled,\n      Shall flee before thy presence fair.We bow us to our lot of care,\n      Beneath thy guidance reconciled;\n    Hear for a maid a maiden's prayer!_Ave Maria!_\n\n[219] Hail, Mary!The beginning of the Roman Catholic prayer to the\nVirgin Mary.[220] \"Down of eider,\" i.e., the soft breast feathers of the eider duck.Died on the harp the closing hymn.--\n    Unmoved in attitude and limb,\n    As list'ning still, Clan-Alpine's lord\n    Stood leaning on his heavy sword,\n    Until the page, with humble sign,\n    Twice pointed to the sun's decline.Then while his plaid he round him cast,\n    \"It is the last time--'tis the last,\"\n    He mutter'd thrice,--\"the last time e'er\n    That angel voice shall Roderick hear!\"It was a goading thought--his stride\n    Hied hastier down the mountain side;\n    Sullen he flung him in the boat,\n    And instant 'cross the lake it shot.They landed in that silvery bay,\n    And eastward held their hasty way,\n    Till, with the latest beams of light,\n    The band arrived on Lanrick height,\n    Where muster'd, in the vale below,\n    Clan-Alpine's men in martial show.A various scene the clansmen made;\n    Some sate, some stood, some slowly stray'd;\n    But most, with mantles folded round,\n    Were couch'd to rest upon the ground,\n    Scarce to be known by curious eye,\n    From the deep heather where they lie,\n    So well was match'd the tartan screen\n    With heath bell dark and brackens green;\n    Unless where, here and there, a blade,\n    Or lance's point, a glimmer made,\n    Like glowworm twinkling through the shade.But when, advancing through the gloom,\n    They saw the Chieftain's eagle plume,\n    Their shout of welcome, shrill and wide,\n    Shook the steep mountain's steady side.Thrice it arose, and lake and fell\n    Three times return'd the martial yell;\n    It died upon Bochastle's plain,\n    And Silence claim'd her evening reign.\"The rose is fairest when 'tis budding new,\n      And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears;\n    The rose is sweetest wash'd with morning dew,\n      And love is loveliest when embalm'd in tears.O wilding[221] rose, whom fancy thus endears,\n      I bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave,\n    Emblem of hope and love through future years!\"--\n      Thus spoke young Norman, heir of Armandave,\n    What time the sun arose on Vennachar's broad wave.Perhaps you may not have noticed that I'm a trifle\ndeaf.(_Shouts._) I think I\ndid notice it.A little hard of hearing, so to speak.You\nsee, young man, I live here entirely alone with my daughter.She talks\nwith nobody but _me_, and is as happy as a bird the livelong day.She must have a sweet old time of it.Now, suppose I were to take for a son-in-law one of the dozen\nwho have already teased my life out for her,--a fellow with his ears\nentirely normal: of course they'd talk together in their natural\nvoice, and force me to be incessantly calling out, \"What's that you're\nsaying?\"The thing's preposterous, of course.Now, with\na son-in-law like yourself,--deaf as a door-post,--this annoyance\ncouldn't happen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.You'd shout at your wife, she'd shout back, of

Boston, Mass.Transcriber's Note:\n\n    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as\n    possible.Italic text has been marked with _underscores_.In a word the method which teacheth to\nfolow a right order, and exactly to enumerate all the circumstances of\nwhat we seek, contains, whatsoever ascertains the rules of Arithmatick.But that which pleas'd me most in this Method was the assurance I had,\nwholly to use my reason, if not perfectly, at least as much as it was in\nmy power; Besides this, I perceived in the practice of it, my minde by\nlittle and little accustom'd it self to conceive its objects more\nclearly and distinctly; and having not subjected it to any particular\nmatter, I promised my self to apply it also as profitable to the\ndifficulties, of other sciences as I had to Algebra: Not that I\ntherefore durst at first undertake to examine all which might present\nthemselves, for that were contrary to the order it prescribes.But\nhaving observ'd that all their principles were to be borrowed from\nPhilosophy, in which I had yet found none that were certain, I thought\nit were needfull for me in the first place to endevor to establish some,\nand that this being the most important thing in the world, wherein\nprecipitation and prevention were the most to be feared, I should not\nundertake to performe it, till I had attain'd to a riper Age then XXIII.Before I had formerly employed a long time in\npreparing my self thereunto, aswel in rooting out of my minde all the\nill opinions I had before that time received, as in getting a stock of\nexperience to serve afterwards for the subject of my reasonings, and in\nexercising my self always in the Method I had prescribed.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.That I might\nthe more and more confine my self therein.But as it is not enough to pull down the house where we dwell, before we\nbegin to re-edify it, and to make provision of materials and architects,\nor performe that office our selves; nor yet to have carefully laid the\ndesign of it; but we must also have provided our selves of some other\nplace of abode during the time of the rebuilding: So that I might not\nremain irresolute in my actions, while reason would oblige me to be so\nin my judgments, and that I might continue to live the most happily I\ncould, I form'd for my own use in the interim a Moral, which consisted\nbut of three or four Maximes, which I shall communicate unto you.The first was to obey the lawes and customes of my Country, constantly\nadhaering to that Religion wherein by the grace of God I had from mine\ninfancy bin bred.And in all other things behaving my self according to\nthe most moderate opinions and those which were farthest from excesse,\nwhich were commonly received in practice by the most judicious Men,\namongst whom I was to live: For beginning from that very time, to reckon\nmine own for nothing, because I could bring them all to the test, I was\nconfident I could not do better then follow those of the deepest sense;\nand although perhaps there are as understanding men amongst the Persians\nor Chineses as amongst us, yet I thought it was more fit to regulate my\nself by those with whom I was to live, and that I might truly know what\ntheir opinions were, I was rather to observe what they practic'd, then\nwhat they taught.Not only by reason of the corruption of our manners,\nthere are but few who will say, all they beleeve, but also because\ndivers are themselves ignorant of it; for the act of the thought by\nwhich we beleeve a thing, being different from that whereby we know that\nwe believe it, the one often is without the other.And amongst divers\nopinions equally receiv'd, I made choise of the most moderate only, as\nwell because they are always the most fit for practice, and probably the\nbest, all excess being commonly ill; As also that I might less err from\nthe right way, if I should perhaps miss it, then if having chosen one of\nthe extremes, it might prove to be the other, which I should have\nfollowed.And particularly I plac'd amongst extremities, all those\npromises by which we somwhat restrain our liberty.Not that I\ndisapproved the laws, which to cure the inconstancy of weak minds,\npermit us when we have any good design, or else for the preservation of\nCommerce, one that is but indifferent, to make vows or contracts, which\noblige us to persevere in them: But because I saw nothing in the world\nremain always in the same state; and forming own particular, promised my\nself to perfect more and more my judgment, and not to impair it, I\nshould have thought my self guilty of a great fault against right\nunderstanding, if because I then approved any thing, I were also\nafterwards oblig'd to take it for good, when perhaps it ceased to be so,\nor that I had ceased to esteem it so.My second Maxime was, To be the most constant and resolute in my actions\nthat I could; and to follow with no less perseverance the most doubtfull\nopinions, when I had once determined them, then if they had been the\nmost certain.Imitating herein Travellers, who having lost their way in\na Forrest, ought not to wander, turning now this way, and then that, and\nless to abide in one place; but stil advance straight forwards, towards\none way, and not to change on slight occasions, although perhaps at\nfirst Chance only mov'd them to determine that choice: For by that\nmeans, if they do not go directly whither they desire, they will at\nleast arrive somewhere where they will probably be better then in the\nmidst of a Forrest.So the actions of this life admitting often of no\ndelay, its a most certain Truth, That when it is not in our power to\ndiscern the truest opinions, we are to follow the most probable: Yea,\nalthough we finde no more probability in the one then in the other, we\nyet ought to determine some way, considering them afterwards no more as\ndoubtful in what they relate to practice; but as most true and certain;\nforasmuch as the reason was so, which made us determine it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.And this was\nsufficient for that time to free me from all the remorse and repentance\nwhich useth to perplex the consciences of those weak and staggering\nminds, which inconstantly suffer themselves to passe to the practice of\nthose things as good, which they afterwards judge evill.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.My third Maxime was, To endevour always rather to conquer my self then\nFortune; and to change my desires, rather then the order of the world:\nand generally to accustome my self to beleeve, That there is nothing\nwholly in our power but our thoughts; so that after we have done our\nbest, touching things which are without us, all whats wanting of success\nin respect of us is absolutely impossible.And this alone seem'd\nsufficient to hinder me from desiring any thing which I could not\nacquire, and so to render me content.For our will naturally moving us\nto desire nothing, but those things which our understanding presents in\nsome manner as possible, certain it is, that if we consider all the good\nwhich is without us, as equally distant from our power, we should have\nno more regret for the want of those which seem due to our births, when\nwithout any fault of ours we shall be deprived of them, then we have in\nwanting the possessions of the Kingdoms of _China_ or _Mexico_.And\nmaking (as we say) vertue of necessity, we should no more desire to be\nin health being sick, or free being in prison, then we now do, to have\nbodies of as incorruptible a matter as diamonds, or wings to fly like\nbirds.But I confess, that a long exercise, and an often reiterated\nmeditation, is necessary to accustom us to look on all things with that\nbyass: And I beleeve, in this principally consists, the secret of those\nPhilosophers who formerly could snatch themselves from the Empire of\nFortune, and in spight of pains and poverty, dispute felicity with their\nGods, for imploying themselves incessantly in considering the bounds\nwhich Nature had prescribed them, they so perfectly perswaded\nthemselves, That nothing was in their power but their thoughts, that,\nthat onely was enough to hinder them from having any affection for other\nthings.And they disposed so absolutely of them, that therein they had\nsome reason to esteem themselves more rich and powerfull, more free and\nhappy then any other men; who wanting this _Philosophy_, though they\nwere never so much favoured by Nature and Fortune, could never dispose\nof all things so well as they desired.Lastly, To conclude these Morals, I thought fit to make a review of mens\nseverall imployments in this life, that I might endeavour to make choice\nof the best, and without prejudice to other mens, I thought I could not\ndo better then to continue in the same wherein I was, that is, to imploy\nall my life in cultivating my Reason, and advancing my self, as far as I\ncould in the knowledge of Truth, following the Method I had prescribed\nmyself.I was sensible of such extreme contentment since I began to use\nthis Method, that I thought none could in this life be capable of any\nmore sweet and innocent: and daily discovering by means thereof, some\nTruths which seemed to me of importance, and commonly such as other men\nwere", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "Besides, that the three\npreceding Maximes were grounded only on the designe I had, to continue\nthe instruction of my self.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.For God having given to every one of us a\nlight to discern truth from falsehood, I could not beleeve I ought to\ncontent my self one moment with the opinions of others, unlesse I had\nproposed to my self in due time to imploy my judgment in the examination\nof them.Neither could I have exempted my self from scruple in following\nthem, had I not hoped to lose no occasion of finding out better, if\nthere were any.But to conclude, I could not have bounded my desires, nor have been\ncontent, had I not followed a way, whereby thinking my self assured to\nacquire all the knowledge I could be capable of: I thought I might by\nthe same means attain to all that was truly good, which should ever be\nwithin my power; forasmuch as our Will inclining it self to follow, or\nfly nothing but what our Understanding proposeth good or ill, to judge\nwell is sufficient to do well, and to judge the best we can, to do also\nwhat's best; to wit, to acquire all vertues, and with them all\nacquirable goods: and whosoever is sure of that, he can never fail of\nbeing content.After I had thus confirmed my self with these Maximes, and laid them up\nwith the Articles of Faith, which always had the first place in my\nBelief, I judg'd that I might freely undertake to expell all the rest of\nmy opinions.And forasmuch as I did hope to bring it the better to passe\nby conversing with men, then by staying any longer in my stove, where I\nhad had all these thoughts: before the Winter was fully ended, I\nreturned to my travels; and in all the nine following yeers I did\nnothing but rowl here and there about the world, endeavouring rather to\nbe a spectator, then an actor in all those Comedies which were acted\ntherein: and reflecting particularly on every subject which might render\nit suspected, or afford any occasion mistake.In the mean time I rooted\nout of my minde all those errours which formerly had crept in.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Not that\nI therein imitated the Scepticks, who doubt onely to the end they may\ndoubt, and affect to be always unresolved: For on the contrary, all my\ndesigne tended onely to fix my self, and to avoid quick-mires and sands,\nthat I might finde rock and clay: which (me thought) succeeded well\nenough; forasmuch as, seeking to discover the falshood or uncertainty of\nthose propositions I examined, (not by weak conjectures, but by clear\nand certain ratiocinations) I met with none so doubtfull, but I thence\ndrew some conclusion certain enough, were it but onely this, That it\ncontained nothing that was certain.And as in pulling down an old house,\ncommonly those materials are reserved which may serve to build a new\none; so in destroying all those my opinions which I judg'd ill grounded,\nI made divers observations, and got severall experiences which served me\nsince to establish more certain ones.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.And besides I continued to\nexercise my self in the Method I had prescribed.For I was not only carefull to direct all my thoughts in generall\naccording to its rules, but I from time to time reserv'd some houres,\nwhich I particularly employd to practice it in difficulties belonging to\nthe Mathematicks, loosening from all the principles of other Sciences,\nwhich I found not stable enough, as you may see I have done in divers\nexplain'd in my other following discourses.And thus not living in\nappearance otherwise then those who having no other business then to\nlead a sweet and innocent life, study to separate pleasures from vices,\nand use honest recreations to enjoy their ease without wearinesse; I did\nnot forbear to pursue my design, and advance in the knowledg of truth,\nperhaps more, then if I had done nothing but read books or frequent\nlearned men.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.Yet these nine years were vanished, before I had engaged my self in\nthose difficulties which use to be disputed amongst the learned; or\nbegun to seek the grounds of any more certain Philosophy then the\nVulgar: And the example of divers excellent Men who formerly having had\nthe same designe, seem'd not to me to have succeeded therein, made me\nimagine so much difficulty, that I had not perhaps dar'd so quickly to\nhave undertaken it, had I not perceiv'd that some already had given it\nout that I had already accomplished it.I know not whereupon they\ngrounded this opinion, and if I have contributed any thing thereto by my\ndiscourse, it must have been by confessing more ingeniously what I was\nignorant of, then those are wont to do who have a little studyed, and\nperhaps also by comunicating those reasons, I had to doubt of many\nthings which others esteem'd most eminent, rather then that I bragg'd of\nany learning.But having integrity enough, not to desire to be taken for\nwhat I was not, I thought that I ought to endeavour by all means to\nrender my self worthy of the reputation which was given me.And 'tis now\neight years since this desire made me resolve to estrange my self from\nall places where I might have any acquaintance, and so retire my self\nhither in a Country where the long continuance of the warre hath\nestablished such orders, that the Armies which are intertain'd there,\nseem to serve onely to make the inhabitants enjoy the fruits of peace\nwith so much the more security; and where amongst the croud of a great\npeople more active and solicitous for their own affaires, then curious\nof other mens, not wanting any of those necessaries which are in the\nmost frequented Towns, I could live as solitary and retired as in the\nmost remote deserts.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.I Know not whether I ought to entertain you with the first Meditations\nwhich I had there, for they are so Metaphysicall and so little common,\nthat perhaps they will not be relished by all men: And yet that you may\njudge whether the foundations I have laid are firm enough, I find my\nself in a manner oblig'd to discourse them; I had long since observed\nthat as for manners, it was somtimes necessary to follow those opinions\nwhich we know to be very uncertain, as much as if they were indubitable,\nas is beforesaid: But because that then I desired onely to intend the\nsearch of truth, I thought I ought to doe the contrary, and reject as\nabsolutely false all wherein I could imagine the least doubt, to the end\nI might see if afterwards any thing might remain in my belief, not at\nall subject to doubt.Thus because our senses sometimes deceive us, I\nwould suppose that there was nothing which was such as they represented\nit to us.And because there are men who mistake themselves in reasoning,\neven in the most simple matters of Geometry, and make therein\nParalogismes, judging that I was as subject to fail as any other Man, I\nrejected as false all those reasons, which I had before taken for\nDemonstrations.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.And considering, that the same thoughts which we have\nwaking, may also happen to us sleeping, when as not any one of them is\ntrue.I resolv'd to faign, that all those things which ever entred into\nmy Minde, were no more true, then the illusions of my dreams.But\npresently after I observ'd, that whilst I would think that all was\nfalse, it must necessarily follow, that I who thought it, must be\nsomething.And perceiving that this Truth, _I think_, therefore, _I am_,\nwas so firm and certain, that all the most extravagant suppositions of\nthe Scepticks was not able to shake it, I judg'd that I might receive it\nwithout scruple for the first principle of the Philosophy I sought.Examining carefully afterwards what I was; and seeing that I could\nsuppose that I had no _body_, and that there was no _World_, nor any\n_place_ where I was: but for all this, I could not feign that I _was\nnot_; and that even contrary thereto, thinking to doubt the truth of\nother things, it most evidently and certainly followed, That _I was_:\nwhereas, if I had ceas'd to _think_, although all the rest of what-ever\nI had imagined were true, I had no reason to beleeve that _I had been_.I knew then that I was a substance, whose whole essence or nature is,\nbut to _think_, and who to _be_, hath need of no place, nor depends on\nany materiall thing.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.So that this _Me_, to wit, my Soul, by which I am\nwhat I am, is wholly distinct from the Body, and more easie to be known\nthen _it_; and although _that_ were not, it would not therefore cease to\nbe what it is.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.After this I considered in generall what is requisite in a Proposition\nto make it true and certain: for since I had found out one which I knew\nto be so, I thought I ought also to consider wherein that certainty\nconsisted: and having observed, That there is nothing at all in this, _I\nthink_, therefore _I am_, which assures me that I speak the truth,\nexcept this, that I see most cleerly, That _to think_, one must have a\n_being_; I judg'd that I might take for a generall rule, That those\nthings which we conceive cleerly and distinctly, are all true; and that\nthe onely difficulty is punctually to observe what those are which we\ndistinctly conceive.In pursuance whereof, reflecting on what I doubted, and that\nconsequently my _being_ was not perfect; for I clearly perceived, that\nit was a greater perfection to know, then to doubt, I advised in my\nself to seek from whence I had learnt to think on something which was\nmore perfect then I; and I knew evidently that it must be of some nature\nwhich was indeed more perfect.As for what concerns the thoughts I had\nof divers other things without my self, as of heaven, earth, light,\nheat, and a thousand more, I was not so much troubled to know whence\nthey came, for that I observed nothing in them which seemed to render\nthem superiour to me; I might beleeve, that if they were true, they were\ndependancies from my nature, as far forth as it had any perfection; and\nif they were not, I made no accompt of them; that is to say, That they\nwere in me, because I had something deficient.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.But it could not be the\nsame with the _Idea_ of a being more perfect then mine: For to esteem of\nit as of nothing, was a thing manifestly impossible.And because there\nis no lesse repugnancy that the more perfect should succeed from and\ndepend upon the less perfect, then for something to proceed from\nnothing, I could no more hold it from my self: So as it followed, that\nit must have bin put into me by a Nature which was truly more perfect\nthen _I_, and even which had in it all the perfections whereof I could\nhave an _Idea_; to wit, (to explain my self in one word) God.Whereto I\nadded, that since I knew some perfections which I had not, I was not the\nonely _Being_ which had an existence, (I shall, under favour, use here\nfreely the terms of the Schools) but that of necessity there must be\nsome other more perfect whereon I depended, and from whom I had gotten\nall what I had: For had I been alone, and depending upon no other thing,\nso that I had had of my self all that little which I participated of a\nperfect Being, I might have had by the same reason from my self, all the\nremainder which I knew I wanted, and so have been my self infinite,\neternall, immutable, all-knowing, almighty; and lastly, have had all\nthose perfections which I have observed to be in God.For according to\nthe way of reasoning I have now followed, to know the nature of God, as\nfar as mine own was capable of it, I was onely to consider of those\nthings of which I found an _Idea_ in me, whether the possessing of them\nwere a perfection or no; and I was sure, that any of those which had any\nimperfections were not in him, but that all others were.I saw that\ndoubtfulness, inconstancy, sorrow and the like, could not be in him,\nseeing I could my self have wish'd to have been exempted from them.Besides this, I had the _Ideas_ of divers sensible and corporeall\nthings; for although I supposed that I doted, and that all that I saw or\nimagined was false; yet could I not deny but that these _Ideas_ were\ntruly in my thoughts.But because I had most evidently known in my self,\nThat the understanding Nature is distinct from the corporeall,\nconsidering that all composition witnesseth a dependency, and that\ndependency is manifestly a defect, I thence judged that it could not be\na perfection in God to be composed of those two Natures; and that by\nconsequence he was not so composed.But that if there were any Bodies in\nthe world, or els any intelligences, or other Natures which were not\nwholly perfect, their being must depend from his power in such a manner,\nthat they could not subsist one moment without him.Thence I went in search of other Truths; and having proposed _Geometry_\nfor my object, which I conceived as a continued Body, or a space\nindefinitely spred in length, bredth, height or depth, divisible into\ndivers parts, which might take severall figures and bignesses, and be\nmoved and transposed every way.For the Geometricians suppose all this\nin their object.I past through some of their most simple\ndemonstrations; and having observed that this great certaintie, which\nall the world grants them, is founded only on this, that men evidently\nconceived them, following the rule I already mentioned.I observed also\nthat there was nothing at all in them which ascertain'd me of the\nexistence of their object.As for example, I well perceive, that\nsupposing a Triangle, three angles necessarily must be equall to two\nright ones: but yet nevertheless I saw nothing which assured me that\nthere was a Triangle in the world.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.Whereas returning to examine the\n_Idea_ which I had of a perfect Being, _I_ found its existence comprised\nin it, in the same manner as it was comprised in that of a Triangle,\nwhere the three angles are equall to two right ones; or in that of a\nsphere, where all the parts are equally distant from the center.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Or even\nyet more evidently, and that by consequence, it is at least as certain\nthat God, who is that perfect Being, is, or exists, as any demonstration\nin Geometry can be.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.But that which makes many perswade themselves that there is difficulty\nin knowing it, as also to know what their Soul is, 'tis that they never\nraise their thoughts beyond sensible things, and that they are so\naccustomed to consider nothing but by imagination, which is a particular\nmanner of thinking on materiall things, that whatsoever is not\nimaginable seems to them not intelligible.Which is manifest enough from\nthis, that even the Philosophers hold for a Maxime in the Schools, That\nthere is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the sense;\nwhere notwithstanding its certain, that the _Ideas_ of God and of the\nSoul never were.And (me thinks) those who use their imagination to\ncomprehend them, are just as those, who to hear sounds, or smell odours,\nwould make use of their eys; save that there is yet this difference,\nThat the sense of seeing assures us no lesse of the truth of its\nobjects, then those of smelling or hearing do: whereas neither our\nimagination, nor our senses, can ever assure us of any thing, if our\nunderstanding intervenes not.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.To be short, if there remain any who are not enough perswaded of the\nexistence of God, and of their soul, from the reasons I have produc'd, I\nwould have them know, that all other things, whereof perhaps they think\nthemselves more assured, as to have a body, and that there are Stars,\nand an earth, and the like, are less certain.For although we had such a\nmorall assurance of these things, that without being extravagant we\ncould not doubt of them.However, unless we be unreasonable when a\nmetaphysicall certainty is in question, we cannot deny but we have cause\nenough not to be wholly confirmed in them, when we consider that in the\nsame manner we may imagine being asleep, we have other bodies, and that\nwe see other Stars, and another earth, though there be no such thing.For how doe we know that those thoughts which we have in our dreams,\nare rather false then the others, seeing often they are no less lively\nand significant, and let the ablest men study it as long as they please,\nI beleeve they can give no sufficient reason to remove this doubt,\nunless they presuppose the existence of God.For first of all, that\nwhich I even now took for a rule, to wit, that those things which were\nmost clearly and distinctly conceived, are all true, is certain, only by\nreason, that God is or exists, and that he is a perfect being, and that\nall which we have comes from him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.Whence it follows, that our Idea's or\nnotions, being reall things, and which come from God in all wherein they\nare clear and distinct, cannot therein be but true.So that if we have\nvery often any which contain falshood, they cannot be but of such things\nwhich are somewhat confus'd and obscure, because that therein they\nsignifie nothing to us, that's to say, that they are thus confus'd in us\nonly, because we are not wholly perfect.And it's evident that there is\nno less contrariety that falshood and imperfection should proceed from\nGod, as such, then there is in this, that truth and falshood proceed\nfrom nothing.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.But if we know not that whatsoever was true and reall in\nus comes from a perfect and infinite being, how clear and distinct\nsoever our Idea's were, we should have no reason to assure us, that they\nhad the perfection to be true.Now after that the knowledge of God, and of the Soul hath rendred us\nthus certain of this rule, it's easie to know; that the extravaganceys\nwhich we imagin in our sleep, ought no way to make us doubt of the truth\nof those thoughts which we have being awake: For if it should happen,\nthat even sleeping we should have a very distinct Idea; as for example,\nA Geometritian should invent some new demonstration, his sleeping would\nnot hinder it to be true.And for the most ordinary error of our\ndreames, which consists in that they represent unto us severall objects\nin the same manner as our exterior senses doe, it matters not though it\ngive us occasion to mistrust the truth of those Ideas, because that they\nmay also often enough cozen us when we doe not sleep; As when to those\nwho have the Jaundies, all they see seems yellow; or, as the Stars or\nother bodies at a distance, appear much less then they are.For in fine,\nwhether we sleep or wake, we ought never to suffer our selves to be\nperswaded but by the evidence of our Reason; I say, (which is\nobservable) Of our Reason, and not of our imagination, or of our senses.As although we see the Sun most clearly, we are not therefore to judge\nhim to be of the bigness we see him of; and we may well distinctly\nimagine the head of a Lion, set on the body of a Goat, but therefore we\nought not to conclude that there is a _Chimera_ in the world.For reason\ndoth not dictate to us, that what we see or imagine so, is true: But it\ndictates, that all our Idea's or notions ought to have some grounds of\ntruth; For it were not possible, that God who is all perfect, and all\ntruth, should have put them in us without that: And because that our\nreasonings are never so evident, nor so entire while we sleep, as when\nwe wake, although sometimes our imaginations be then as much or more\nlively and express.It also dictates to us, that our thoughts, seeing\nthey cannot be all true by reason that we are not wholly perfect; what\nthey have of truth, ought infallibly to occur in those which we have\nbeing awake, rather then in our dreams.V.\n\n\nI should be glad to pursue this Discourse, and shew you the whole Series\nof the following Truths, which I have drawn from the former: But because\nfor this purpose, it were now necessary for me to treat of severall\nquestions, which are controverted by the learned, with whom I have no\ndesire to imbroil my self, I beleeve it better for me to abstain from\nit; and so in generall onely to discover what they are, that I may leave\nthe wisest to judge whether it were profitable to inform the publick\nmore particularly of them.I alwayes remained constant to my resolution,\nto suppose no other Principle but that which I now made use of, for the\ndemonstration of the Existence of God, and of the Soul; and to receive\nnothing for true, which did not seem to me more clear and more certain\nthen the demonstrations of Geometry had formerly done.And yet I dare\nsay, that I have not onely found out the means to satisfie my self, in a\nshort time, concerning all the principall difficulties which are usually\ntreated in Philosophy.But that also _I_ have observed certain Laws\nwhich God hath so established in Nature, and of which he hath imprinted\nsuch notions in our Souls, that when we shall have made sufficient\nreflections upon them we cannot doubt but that they are exactly observed\nin whatsoever either is, or is done in the World.Then considering the\nconnexion of these Laws, me thinks, I have discovercd divers Truths,\nmore usefull and important then whatever _I_ learn'd before, or ever\nhop'd to learn.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.But because _I_ have endeavoured to lay open the principall of them in a\nTreatise, which some considerations hinder me from publishing; _I_ can\nno way better make them known, then by relating summarily what it\ncontains.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.I had a designe to comprehend all what I thought _I_ knew, before _I_\nwould write it, touching the nature of material things.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.But even as\nPainters, not being able equally well to represent upon a _flat_ all the\nseverall facies of a solid body, chuse the principall of them, which\nthey place towards the light; and shadowing the others, make them appear\nno more then they do to our sight: So, fearing lest _I_ should not bring\ninto this Discourse all which was in my thoughts, _I_ onely undertook to\nset forth at large my conceptions touching the light; and upon that\noccasion to add somewhat of the Sun, and of the fix'd Stars, by reason\nthat it proceeds almost all from thence; of the Heavens, because they\ntransmit it; of the Planets, of the Comets, and of the Earth, because\nthey cause it to reflect; and in particular, of all Bodies which are on\nthe earth, whether for that they are either coloured, or transparent, or\nluminous; and last of all, of Man, because he is the Spectator thereof.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the apple.As also, in some manner to shadow out all these things, and that _I_\nmight the more freely speak what _I_ judg'd, without being obliged to\nfollow, or to refute the opinions which are received amongst the\nLearned, _I_ resolved to leave all this world here to their disputes,\nand to speak onely of what would happen in a new one, if God now created\nsome where in those imaginary spaces matter enough to compose it, and\nthat he diversly and without order agitated the severall parts of this\nmatter, so as to compose a Chaos of it as confused as the Poets could\nfeign one: and that afterwards he did nothing but lend his ordinary\nconcurrence to Nature, and leave her to work according to the Laws he\nhath established.Thus first of all _I_ described this Matter, and endevoured to\nrepresent it such, that me thinks there is nothing in the world more\nclear, or more intelligible, except what was beforesaid of God, and of\nthe Soul.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.For even _I_ expresly supposed that there was in it none of\nthose forms and qualities which are disputed in the Schools; nor\ngenerally any thing but that the knowledge thereof was so naturall to\nour understandings, that we could not even feigne to be ignorant of it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.Besides, I made known what the Laws of Nature were; and without\ngrounding my reasons on any other principles, but on the infinite\nperfections of God, I did endeavour to demonstrate all those which might\nbe questioned, and to make them appear to be such, that although God had\ncreated divers worlds, there could have been none where they were not\nobserved.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.Afterwards _I_ shewed how the greater part of the Matter of\nthis _Chaos_ ought, according to those Laws, to dispose and order it\nself in a certain manner, which would make it like our Heavens: And how\nsome of these parts were to compose an Earth, and some Planets and\nCommets, some others a Sun and fix'd Starrs.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.And here enlarging my self\non the subject of Light, _I_ at length explain'd what that light was,\nwhich was to be in the Sun and Stars; and thence how it travers'd in an\ninstant the immense spaces of the Heavens, and how it reflected it self\nfrom Planets and Commets towards the Earth._I_ added also divers things\ntouching the substance, situation, the motions, and all the several\nqualities of these heavens and these stars: So that _I_ thought _I_ had\nsaid enough to make known, That there is nothing remarkable in those of\nthis world, which ought not, or at least could not appear altogether\nlike to these of that world which _I_ described.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.Thence _I_ came to speak particularly of the Earth; how, although I had\nexpresly supposed, that God had placed no weight in the Matter whereof\nit was composed; yet all its parts exactly tended towards its center:\nHow that there being water and air upon its superficies, the disposition\nof the Heavens, and of the Starrs, and chiefly of the Moon, ought to\ncause a floud and an ebb, which in all circumstances was like to that\nwhich we observe in our Seas; And besides, a certain course aswel of the\nwater, as of the air, from East to West, as is also observed between the\nTropicks: How the Mountains, the Seas, the Springs and Rivers might\nnaturally be form'd therein, and Metals run in the mines, and Plants\ngrow in the Fields, and generally all bodies be therein engendered which\nare call'd mixt or composed.And amongst other things, because that next the Stars, I know nothing in\nthe world but Fire, which produceth light, I studied to make all clearly\nunderstood which belongs to its nature; how it's made, how it's fed,\nhow sometimes it hath heat onely without light, and sometimes onely\nlight without heat; how it can introduce several colours into several\nbodies, and divers other qualities; how it dissolves some, and hardens\nothers; how it can consume almost all, or convert them into ashes and\nsmoak: and last of all, how of those ashes, by the only violence of its\naction, it forms glass.For this transmutation of ashes into glass,\nseeming to me to be as admirable as any other operation in Nature, I\nparticularly took pleasure to describe it.Yet would I not inferre from all these things, that this World was\ncreated after the manner I had proposed.For it is more probable that\nGod made it such as it was to be, from the beginning.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.But it's certain,\nand 'tis an opinion commonly received amongst the Divines, That the\naction whereby he now preserveth it, is the same with that by which he\ncreated it.So that, although at the beginning he had given it no other\nform but that of a Chaos (provided, that having established the Laws of\nNature, he had afforded his concurrence to it, to work as it used to do)\nwe may beleeve (without doing wrong to the miracle of the Creation) that\nby that alone all things which are purely material might in time have\nrendred themselves such as we now see them: and their nature is far\neasier to conceive, when by little and little we see them brought forth\nso, then when we consider them quite form'd all at once.From the description of inanimate Bodies and Plants, I pass'd to that of\nAnimals, and particularly to that of Men.But because I had not yet\nknowledge enough to speak of them in the same stile as of the others; to\nwit, in demonstrating effects by their causes, and shewing from what\nseeds, and in what manner Nature ought to produce them; I contented my\nself to suppose, That God form'd the body of a Man altogether like one\nof ours; aswel the exteriour figure of its members, as in the interiour\nconformity of its organs; without framing it of other matter then of\nthat which I had described; and without putting in it at the beginning\nany reasonable soul, or any other thing to serve therein for a\nvegetative or sensitive soul; unless he stirr'd up in his heart one of\nthose fires without light which I had already discovered; and that I\nconceiv'd of no other nature but that which heats hay when its housed\nbefore it be dry, or which causes new Wines to boyl when it works upon\nthe grape: For examining the functions which might be consequently in\nthis body, I exactly found all those which may be in us, without our\nthinking of them; and to which our soul (that is to say, that distinct\npart from our bodies, whose nature (as hath been said before) is onely\nto think) consequently doth not contribute, and which are all the same\nwherein we may say unreasonable creatures resemble us.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Yet could I not\nfinde any, of those which depending from the thought, are the onely ones\nwhich belong unto us as Men; whereas I found them all afterwards, having\nsupposed that God created a reasonable soul, and that he joyn'd it to\nthis body, after a certain manner which I describ'd.But that you might see how I treated this matter, I shall here present\nyou with the explication of the motion of the heart, and of the\narteries, which being the first and most general (which is observed in\nanimals) we may thereby easily judge what we ought to think of all the\nrest.And that we may have the less difficulty to understand what I\nshall say thereof, I wish those who are not versed in Anatomy, would\ntake the pains, before they read this, to cause the heart of some great\nanimal which hath lungs, to be dissected; for in all of them its very\nlike that of a Man: and that they may have shewn them the two cels or\nconcavities which are there: First that on the right side, whereto two\nlarge conduits answer, to wit, the _vena cava_, which is the principal\nreceptacle of bloud, and as the body of a tree, whereof all the other\nveins of the body are branches; and the arterious vein, which was so\nmis-call'd, because that in effect its an artery, which taking its\n_origine_ from the heart, divides it self after being come forth, into\ndivers branches, which every way spred themselves through the lungs.Then the other which is on the left side, whereunto in the same manner\ntwo pipes answer, which are as large, or larger then the former; to wit,\nthe veinous artery, which was also il named, forasmuch as its nothing\nelse but a vein which comes from the lungs, where its divided into\nseveral branches interlaid with those of the arterious vein, and those\nof that pipe which is called the Whistle, by which the breath enters.And the great artery, which proceeding from the heart, disperseth its\nbranches thorow all the body.I would also that they would carefully\nobserve the eleven little skins, which, as so many little doors, open\nand shut the four openings which are in these two concavities; to wit,\nthree at the entry of the _vena cava_, where they are so disposed, that\nthey can no wayes hinder the bloud which it contains from running into\nthe right concavity of the heart; and yet altogether hinder it from\ncoming out.Three at the entry of the arterious vein; which being\ndisposed quite contrary, permit only the bloud which is in that\nconcavity to pass to the lungs; but not that which is in the lungs to\nreturn thither.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.And then two others at the entry of the veinous artery,\nwhich permits the bloud to run to the left concavity of the heart, but\nopposeth its return.And three at the entry of the great artery, which\npermit it to go from the heart, but", "question": "Where is the milk?

whereas the other, being\nround, may the better be clos'd with three.Besides, I would have them\nconsider, that the great artery and the arterious vein are of a\ncomposition much stronger then the veinous artery or the _vena cava_.And that these two later grow larger before they enter into the heart,\nand make (as it were) two purses, call'd the ears of the heart, which\nare composed of a flesh like it; and that there is always more heat in\nthe heart then in any other part of the body.And in fine, that if any\ndrop of bloud enter into these concavities, this heat is able to make it\npresently swell and dilate it self, as generally all liquors do, when\ndrop by drop we let them fall into a very hot vessel.For after this I need say no more for to unfold the motion of the\nheart, but that when these concavities are not full of bloud,\nnecessarily there runs some from the _vena cava_ into the right, and\nfrom the veinous artery into the left; for that these two vessels are\nalways full of it, and that their openings which are towards the heart\ncannot then be shut: But that assoon as there is thus but two drops of\nbloud entred, one in either of these concavities, these drops, which\ncannot but be very big, by reason that their openings whereby they enter\nare very large, and the vessels whence they come very full of bloud, are\nrarified and dilated because of the heat which they find therein.By\nmeans whereof, causing all the heart to swel, they drive and shut the\nfive little doors which are at the entry of the two vessels whence they\ncome, hindering thereby any more bloud to fall down into the heart, and\ncontinuing more and more to rarifie themselves, they drive and open the\nsix other little doors which are at the entry of the other two vessels\nwhence they issue, causing by that means all the branches of the\narterious vein, and of the great artery, to swel (as it were) at the\nsame time with the heart: which presently after fals, as those arteries\nalso do, by reason that the bloud which is entred therein grows colder,\nand their six little doors shut up again, and those five of the _vena\ncava_, and of the veinous artery open again, and give way to two other\ndrops of bloud, which again swell the heart and the arteries in the same\nmanner as the preceding did.And because the bloud which thus enters\ninto the heart, passeth thorow those two purses, which are call'd the\nears; thence it comes, that their motion is contrary to the heart's, and\nthat they fall when that swels.Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,\nand are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,\nmay not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise\nthem, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily\nfollows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be\nseen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our\nfingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by\nexperience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and\nfigure of its weight and wheels.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not\nexhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the\narteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart\ndischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what\nhath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must\nbe given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who\ntaught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of\nthe arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,\nenters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self\nback towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a\nperpetuall circulation.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary\nexperience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard\nabove the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to\nissue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound.And the contrary\nwould happen, were it bound underneath, between the hand and the\nincision, or bound very hard above.For its manifest, that the band\nindifferently tyed, being able to hinder the bloud which is already in\nthe arm to return towards the heart by the veins; yet it therefore\nhinders not the new from coming always by the arteries, by reason they\nare placed under the veins, and that their skin being thicker, are less\neasie to be press'd, as also that the bloud which comes from the heart,\nseeks more forcibly to passe by them towards the hand, then it doth to\nreturn from thence towards the heart by the veins.And since this bloud\nwhich issues from the arm by the incision made in one of the veins, must\nnecessarily have some passage under the bond, to wit, towards the\nextremities of the arm, whereby it may come thither by the arteries, he\nalso proves very well what he sayes of the course of the bloud through\ncertain little skins, which are so disposed in divers places along the\nveins, which permit it not to pass from the middle towards the\nextremities, but onely to return from the extremities towards the heart.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.And besides this, experience shews, That all the bloud which is in the\nbody may in a very little time run out by one onely artery's being cut,\nalthough it were even bound very neer the heart, and cut betwixt it and\nthe ligature: So that we could have no reason to imagine that the bloud\nwhich issued thence could come from any other part.But there are divers other things which witness, that the true cause of\nthis motion of the bloud is that which I have related.As first, The\ndifference observed between that which issues out of the veins, and that\nwhich comes out of the arteries, cannot proceed but from its being\nrarified and (as it were) distilled by passing thorow the heart: its\nmore subtil, more lively, and more hot presently after it comes out;\nthat is to say, being in the arteries, then it is a little before it\nenters them, that is to say, in the veins.And if you observe, you will\nfinde, that this difference appears not well but about the heart; and\nnot so much in those places which are farther off.Next, the hardnesse\nof the skin of which the artery vein and the great artery are composed,\nsheweth sufficiently, that the bloud beats against them more forcibly\nthen against the veins.And why should the left concavity of the heart,\nand the great artery be more large and ample then the right concavity,\nand the arterious vein; unless it were that the bloud of the veinous\nartery, having bin but onely in the lungs since its passage thorow the\nheart, is more subtil, and is rarified with more force and ease then the\nbloud which immediately comes from the _vena cava_.And what can the\nPhysicians divine by feeling of the pulse, unlesse they know, that\naccording as the bloud changeth its nature, it may by the heat of the\nheart be rarified to be more or lesse strong, and more or lesse quick\nthen before.And if we examine how this heat is communicated to the\nother members, must we not avow that 'tis by means of the bloud, which\npassing the heart, reheats it self there, and thence disperseth it self\nthorow the whole body: whence it happens, that if you take away the\nbloud from any part, the heat by the same means also is taken a way.And\nalthough the heart were as burning as hot iron, it were not sufficient\nto warm the feet and the hands so often as it doth, did it not continue\nto furnish them with new bloud.Besides, from thence we know also that the true use of respiration is to\nbring fresh air enough to the lungs, to cause that bloud which comes\nfrom the right concavity of the heart, where it was rarified, and (as it\nwere) chang'd into vapours, there to thicken, and convert it self into\nbloud again, before it fall again into the left, without which it would\nnot be fit to serve for the nourishment of the fire which is there.Which is confirm'd, for that its seen, that animals which have no lungs\nhave but one onely concavity in the heart; and that children, who can\nmake no use of them when they are in their mothers bellies, have an\nopening, by which the bloud of the _vena cava_ runs to the left\nconcavity of the heart, and a conduit by which it comes from the\narterious vein into the great artery without passing the lungs.Next, How would the concoction be made in the stomach, unlesse the heart\nsent heat by the arteries, and therewithall some of the most fluid parts\nof the bloud, which help to dissolve the meat receiv'd therein?and is\nnot the act which converts the juice of these meats into bloud easie to\nbe known, if we consider, that it is distill'd by passing and repassing\nthe heart, perhaps more then one or two hundred times a day?And what\nneed we ought else to explain the nutrition and the production of divers\nhumours which are in the body, but to say, that the force wherewith the\nbloud in rarifying it self, passeth from the heart towards the\nextremities or the arteries, causeth some of its parts to stay amongst\nthose of the members where they are, and there take the place of some\nothers, which they drive from thence?And that according to the\nsituation, or the figure, or the smalnesse of the pores which they\nmeet, some arrive sooner in one place then others.In the same manner\nas we may have seen in severall sieves, which being diversly pierc'd,\nserve to sever divers grains one from the other.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.And briefly, that which\nis most remarkable herein, is the generation of the animal spirits,\nwhich are as a most subtil wind, or rather, as a most pure and lively\nflame, which continually rising in great abundance from the heart to the\nbrain, dischargeth it self thence by the nerves into the muscles, and\ngives motion to all the members; without imagining any other reason\nwhich might cause these parts of the bloud, which being most mov'd, and\nthe most penetrating, are the most fit to form these spirits, tend\nrather towards the brain, then to any other part.Save onely that the\narteries which carry them thither, are those which come from the heart\nin the most direct line of all: And that according to the rules of the\nMechanicks, which are the same with those of Nature, when divers things\ntogether strive to move one way, where there is not room enough for all;\nso those parts of bloud which issue from the left concavity of the heart\ntend towards the brain, the weaker and less agitated are expell'd by the\nstronger, who by that means arrive there alone.I had particularly enough expounded all these things in a Treatise which\nI formerly had design'd to publish: In pursuit whereof, I had therein\nshewed what ought to be the fabrick of the nerves and muscles of an\nhumane body, to cause those animall spirits which were in them, to have\nthe power to move those members.As we see that heads a while after they\nare cut off, yet move of themselves, and bite the ground, although they\nare not then animated.What changes ought to be made in the brain to\ncause waking, sleeping, and dreaming: how light, sounds, smels, tasts,\nheat, and all other qualities of exteriour objects, might imprint\nseverall _Ideas_ by means of the senses.How hunger and thirst, and the\nother interiour passions might also send theirs thither.What ought to\nbe taken therein for common sense, where these _Ideas_ are received; for\nmemory which preserves them; and for fancy, which can diversly change\nthem, and form new ones of them; and by the same means, distributing the\nanimal spirits into the muscles, make the members of the body move in so\nmany severall fashions, and as fitly to those objects which present\nthemselves to its senses; and to the interiour passions which are in\nthem, as ours may move themselves without the consent of the Wil.Which\nwil seem nothing strange to those, who knowing how many _Automatas_ or\nmoving Machines the industry of men can make, imploying but very few\npieces, in comparison of the great abundance of bones, muscles, nerves,\narteries, veins, and all the other parts which are in the body of every\nAnimal, will consider this body as a fabrick, which having been made by\nthe hands of God, is incomparably better ordered, and hath more\nadmirable motions in it then any of those which can be invented by men.And herein I particularly insisted, to make it appear, that if there\nwere such Machines which had organs, and the exteriour figure of an Ape,\nor of any other unreasonable creature, we should finde no means of\nknowing them not to be altogether of the same nature as those Animals:\nwhereas, if there were any which resembled our bodies, and imitated our\nactions as much as morally it were possible, we should always have two\nmost certain ways to know, that for all that they were not reall men:\nThe first of which is, that they could never have the use of speech, nor\nof other signes in framing it, as we have, to declare our thoughts to\nothers: for we may well conceive, that a Machine may be so made, that it\nmay utter words, and even some proper to the corporal actions, which\nmay cause some change in its organs; as if we touch it in some part, and\nit should ask what we would say; or so as it might cry out that one\nhurts it, and the like: but not that they can diversifie them to answer\nsensibly to all what shall be spoken in its presence, as the dullest men\nmay do.And the second is, That although they did divers things aswel,\nor perhaps better, then any of us, they must infallibly fail in some\nothers, whereby we might discover that they act not with knowledge, but\nonely by the disposition of their organs: for whereas Reason is an\nuniversal instrument which may serve in all kinde of encounters, these\norgans have need of some particular disposition for every particular\naction: whence it is, that its morally impossible for one Machine to\nhave severall organs enough to make it move in all the occurrences of\nthis life, in the same manner as our Reason makes us move.Now by these\ntwo means we may also know the difference which is between Men and\nBeasts: For 'tis a very remarkable thing, that there are no men so dull\nand so stupid, without excepting those who are out of their wits, but\nare capable to rank severall words together, and of them to compose a\nDiscourse, by which they make known their thoughts: and that on the\ncontrary, there is no other creature, how perfect or happily soever\nbrought forth, which can do the like.The which happens, not because\nthey want organs; for we know, that Pyes and Parrots can utter words\neven as we can, and yet cannot speak like us; that is to say, with\nevidence that they think what they say.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the apple there.Whereas Men, being born deaf and\ndumb, and deprived of those organs which seem to make others speak, as\nmuch or more then beasts, usually invent of themselves to be understood\nby those, who commonly being with them, have the leisure to learn their\nexpressions.And this not onely witnesseth, that Beasts have lesse\nreason than men, but that they have none at all.For we see there needs\nnot much to learn to speak: and forasmuch as we observe inequality\namongst Beasts of the same kind, aswell as amongst men, and that some\nare more easily managed then others; 'tis not to be believed, but that\nan Ape or a Parrot which were the most perfect of its kinde, should\ntherein equall the most stupid child, or at least a child of a\ndistracted brain, if their souls were not of a nature wholly different\nfrom ours.And we ought not to confound words with naturall motions,\nwhich witness passions, and may be imitated by Machines aswell as by\nAnimals; nor think (as some of the Ancients) that beasts speak, although\nwe do not understand their language: for if it were true, since they\nhave divers organs which relate to ours, they could aswell make\nthemselves understood by us, as by their like.Its likewise very\nremarkable that although there are divers creatures which express more\nindustry then we in some one of their actions; yet we may well perceive,\nthat the same shew none at all in many others: So that what they do\nbetter then we, proves not at all that they have reason; for by that\nreckoning they would have more then any of us, and would do better in\nall other things; but rather, that they have none at all, and that its\nNature onely which works in them according to the disposition of their\norgans.As wee see a Clock, which is onely composed of wheels and\nsprings, can reckon the hours, and measure the times more exactly then\nwe can with all our prudence.After this I had described the reasonable Soul, and made it appear, that\nit could no way be drawn from the power of the Matter, as other things\nwhereof I had spoken; but that it ought to have been expresly created:\nAnd how it suffiseth not for it to be lodg'd in our humane body as a\nPilot in his ship, to move its members onely; but also that its\nnecessary it be joyned and united more strongly therewith to have\nthoughts and appetites like ours, and so make a reall man.I have here dilated my self a little on the subject of the Soul, by\nreason 'tis of most importance; for, next the errour of those who deny\nGod, which I think I have already sufficiently confuted, there is none\nwhich sooner estrangeth feeble minds from the right way of vertue, then\nto imagine that the soul of beasts is of the same nature as ours, and\nthat consequently we have nothing to fear nor hope after this life, no\nmore then flies or ants.Whereas, when we know how different they are,\nwe comprehend much better the reasons which prove that ours is of a\nnature wholly independing from the body, and consequently that it is not\nsubject to die with it.And that when we see no other cause which\ndestroys it, we are naturally thence moved to judge that it's immortall.Its now three years since I ended the Treatise which contains all these\nthings, and that I began to review it, to send it afterwards to the\nPresse, when I understood, that persons to whom I submit, and whose\nauthority can no lesse command my actions, then my own Reason doth my\nthoughts, had disapproved an opinion in Physicks, published a little\nbefore by another; of which I will not say that I was, but that indeed I\nhad observed nothing therein, before their censure, which I could have\nimagined prejudiciall either to Religion or the State; or consequently,\nwhich might have hindred me from writing the same, had my Reason\nperswaded mee thereto.And this made me fear, lest in the same manner\nthere might be found some one amongst mine, in which I might have been\nmistaken; notwithstanding the great care I always had to admit no new\nones into my belief, of which I had not most certain demonstrations; and\nnot to write such as might turn to the disadvantage of any body.Which\nwas sufficient to oblige me to change my resolution of publishing them.For although the reasons for which I had first of all taken it, were\nvery strong; yet my inclination, which alwayes made me hate the trade of\nBook-making, presently found me out others enough to excuse my self from\nit.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.And these reasons on the one and other side are such, that I am not\nonly somewhat concern'd to speak them; but happily the Publick also to\nknow them.I never did much esteem those things which proceeded from mine own\nbrain; and so long as I have gathered no other fruits from the Method I\nuse, but onely that I have satisfied my self in some difficulties which\nbelong to speculative Sciences, or at least endeavoured to regulate my\nManners by the reasons it taught me, I thought my self not obliged to\nwrite any thing of them.For, as for what concerns Manners, every one\nabounds so much in his own sense, That we may finde as many Reformers as\nheads, were it permitted to others, besides those whom God hath\nestablished as Soveraigns over his people, or at least, to whom he hath\ndispensed grace and zeal enough to be Prophets, to undertake the change\nof any thing therein.And although my Speculations did very much please\nme, I did beleeve that other men also had some, which perhaps pleas'd\nthem more.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.But as soon as I had acquired some generall notions touching\nnaturall Philosophy, and beginning to prove them in divers particular\ndifficulties, I observed how far they might lead a man, and how far\ndifferent they were from the principles which to this day are in use; I\njudg'd, that I could not keep them hid without highly sinning against\nthe Law, which obligeth us to procure, as much as in us lies, the\ngeneral good of all men.For they made it appear to me, that it was\npossible to attain to points of knowledge, which may be very profitable\nfor this life: and that in stead of this speculative Philosophy which is\ntaught in the Schools, we might finde out a practicall one, by which\nknowing the force and workings of Fire, Water, Air, of the Starrs, of\nthe Heavens, and of all other Bodies which environ us, distinctly, as we\nknow the several trades of our Handicrafts, we might in the same manner\nemploy them to all uses to which they are fit, and so become masters and\npossessours of Nature.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.Which is not onely to be desired for the\ninvention of very many expedients of Arts, which without trouble might\nmake us enjoy the fruits of the earth, and all the conveniences which\nare to be found therein: But chiefly also for the preservation of\nhealth, which (without doubt) is the first good, and the foundation of\nall other good things in this life.For even the minde depends so much\non the temper and disposition of the organs of the body, that if it be\npossible to finde any way of making men in the generall wiser, and more\nable then formerly they were, I beleeve it ought to be sought in\nPhysick.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk.True it is, that which is now in use contains but few things,\nwhose benefit is very remarkable: But (without any designe of slighting\nof it) I assure my self, there is none, even of their own profession,\nbut will consent, that whatsoever is known therein, is almost nothing in\ncompanion of what remains to be known.And that we might be freed from\nvery many diseases, aswell of the body as of the mind, and even also\nperhaps from the weaknesses of old age, had we but knowledge enough of\ntheir Causes, and of all the Remedies wherewith Nature hath furnished\nus.Now having a designe to employ all my life in the enquiry of so\nnecessary a Science; and having found a way, the following of which me\nthinks might infallibly lead us to it, unless we be hindred by the\nshortness of life, or by defect of experiments.I judg'd that there was\nno better Remedie against those two impediments, but faithfully to\ncommunicate to the publique, all that little I should discover, and to\ninvite all good Wits to endevour to advance farther in contributing\nevery one, according to his inclination and power, to those Experiments\nwhich are to be made, and communicating also to the publique all the\nthings they should learn; so that the last, beginning where the\nprecedent ended, and so joyning the lives and labors of many in one, we\nmight all together advance further then any particular Man could do.I also observ'd touching Experiments, that they are still so much the\nmore necessary, as we are more advanc'd in knowledg.For in the\nbeginning it's better to use those only which of themselves are\npresented to our senses, and which we cannot be ignorant of, if we do\nbut make the least reflections upon them, then to seek out the rarest\nand most studied ones.The reason whereof is, that those which are\nrarest, doe often deceive, when we seldome know the same of the most\ncommon ones, and that the circumstances on which they depend, are, as it\nwere, always so particular, and so small, that it's very uneasie to\nfinde them out.First, I\nendevoured to finde in generall the Principles or first Causes of\nwhatsoever is or may be in the world, without considering any thing for\nthis end, but God alone who created it, or drawing them elsewhere, then\nfrom certain seeds of Truth which naturally are in our souls.After\nthis, I examined what were the first and most ordinary Effects which\nmight be deduced from these Causes: And me thinks that thereby I found\nout Heavens, Starrs, an Earth; and even on the Earth, Water, Air and\nFire, Minerals, and some other such like things, which are the most\ncommon, and the most simple of all, and consequently the most easie to\nbe understood.Afterwards, when I would descend to those which were more\nparticular, there were so many severall ones presented themselves to me,\nthat I did beleeve it impossible for a humane understanding to\ndistinguish the forms and species of Bodies which are on the earth, from\nan infinite number of others which might be there, had it been the will\nof God so to place them: Nor by consequence to apply them to our use,\nunless we set the Effects before the Causes, and make use of divers\nparticular experiments; In relation to which, revolving in my minde all\nthose objects which ever were presented to my senses, I dare boldly say,\nI observed nothing which I could not fitly enough explain by the\nprinciples I had found.But I must also confesse that the power of\nNature is so ample and vast, and these principles are so simple and\ngenerall, that I can observe almost no particular Effect, but that I\npresently know it might be deduced from thence in many severall ways:\nand that commonly my greatest difficulty is to finde in which of these\nways it depends thereon; for I know no other expedient for that, but\nagain to seek some experiments, which may be such, that their event may\nnot be the same, if it be in one of those ways which is to be exprest,\nas if it were in another.In fine, I am gotten so far, That (me thinks)\nI see well enough what course we ought to hold to make the most part of\nthose experiments which may tend to this effect.But I also see they\nare such, and of so great a number, that neither my hands nor my estate\n(though I had a thousand times more then I have) could ever suffice for\nall.So that according as I shall hereafter have conveniency to make\nmore or fewer of them, I shall also advance more or lesse in the\nknowledge of Nature, which I hop'd I should make known by the Treatise\nwhich I had written; and therein so clearly shew the benefit which the\nPublick may receive thereby, that I should oblige all those in general\nwho desire the good of Mankinde; that is to say, all those who are\nindeed vertuous, (and not so seemingly, or by opinion only) aswell to\ncommunicate such experiments as they have already made, as to help me in\nthe enquiry of those which are to be made.But since that time, other reasons have made me alter my opinion, and\nthink that I truly ought to continue to write of all those things which\nI judg'd of any importance, according as I should discover the truth of\nthem, and take the same care, as if I were to print them; as well that I\nmight have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as\nwithout doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the\npublick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and\noftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first\nconceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing\nthem to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the\nPublick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,\nthose to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what\nuse of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published\nduring my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto\nperhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it\nwere, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of\nmispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for\nalthough it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in\nhim lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is\nproperly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought\nto reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those\nthings which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are\nalive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more\nadvantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that\nthe little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of\nwhat I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For\nit's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the\ntruth in Learning; as with those who beginning to grow rich, are less\ntroubled to make great purchases, then they were before when they were\npoorer, to make little ones.Or else one may compare them to Generals of\nArmies, whose Forces usually encrease porportionably to their Victories;\nand who have need of more conduct to maintain themselves after the loss\nof a battail, then after the gaining one, to take Towns and Provinces.For to endeavour to overcome all the difficulties and errours which\nhinder us to come to the knowledg of the Truth, is truly to fight\nbattails.And to receive any false opinion touching a generall or\nweighty matter, is as much as to lose one; there is far more dexterity\nrequired to recover our former condition, then to make great progresses\nwhere our Principles are already certain.For my part, if I formerly\nhave discovered some Truths in Learning, as I hope my Discourse will\nmake it appear I have, I may say, they are but the products and\ndependances of five or six principall difficulties which I have\novercome, and which I reckon for so many won Battails on my side.Neither will I forbear to say; That I think, It's only necessary for me\nto win two or three more such, wholly to perfect my design.And that I\nam not so old, but according to the ordinary course of Nature, I may\nhave time enough to effect it.But I beleeve I am so much the more\nobliged to husband the rest of my time, as I have more hopes to employ\nit well; without doubt, I should have divers occasions of impeding it,\nshould I publish the grounds of my Physicks.For although they are\nalmost all so evident, that to beleeve them, it's needfull onely to\nunderstand them; and that there is none whereof I think my self unable\nto give demonstration.Yet because it's impossible that they should\nagree with all the severall opinions of other men, I foresee I should\noften be diverted by the opposition they would occasion.It may be objected, These oppositions might be profitable, as well to\nmake me know my faults, as if any thing of mine were good to make others\nby that means come to a better understanding thereof; and as many may\nsee more then one man, beginning from this time to make use of my\ngrounds, they might also help me with their invention.But although I\nknow my self extremely subject to fail, and do never almost trust my\nfirst thoughts; yet the experience I have of the objections which may be\nmade unto me, hinder me from hoping for any profit from them; For I have\noften tried the judgments as well of those whom I esteem'd my friends,\nas of others whom I thought indifferent, and even also of some, whose\nmalignity and envie did sufficiently discover what the affection of my\nfriends might hide.But it seldom happened that any thing was objected\nagainst me, which I had not altogether foreseen, unless it were very\nremote from my Subject: So that I never almost met with any Censurer of\nmy opinions, that seemed unto me either less rigorous, or less equitable\nthen my self.Neither did I ever observe, that by the disputations\npracticed in the Schools any Truth which was formerly unknown, was ever\ndiscovered.For whilest every one seeks to overcome, men strive more to\nmaintain probabilities, then to weigh the reasons on both sides; and\nthose who for a long time have been good Advocates, are not therefore\nthe better Judges afterwards.As", "question": "Where is the milk?

yet when they repeated them, I observ'd,\nthat they chang'd them almost always in such a manner, that I could no\nlonger own them for mine.Upon which occasion, I shall gladly here\ndesire those who come after me, never to beleeve those things which may\nbe delivered to them for mine, when I have not published them my self.And I do not at all wonder at the extravagancies which are attributed to\nall those ancient Philosophers, whose Writings we have not;

so that there is no means left to convince them.I do not, however, think this is meant, since there is\nnot a single piece of land in Jaffnapatam for which no taxes are paid,\nand it is for the purpose of finding this out that the new Thombo is\nbeing compiled.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.H.--The account between the Moorish elephant purchasers and the\nCompany through the Brahmin Timmerza as its agent, about which so\nmuch has been written, was settled on August 31 last, and so also\nwas the account of the said Timmerza himself and the Company.A\ndifficulty arises now as to how the business with these people is\nto be transacted; because three of the principal merchants from\nGalconda arrived here the other day with three cheques to the amount\nof 7,145 Pagodas in the name of the said Timmerza.According to the\norders by His Excellency Thomas van Rhee the latter is no longer to\nbe employed as the Company's agent, so there is some irregularity\nin the issue of these cheques and this order, in which it is stated\nthat the cheques must bear the names of the purchasers themselves,\nwhile on the other hand the purchasers made a special request that\nthe amount due to them might be paid to their attorneys in cash or\nelephants through the said Timmerza.However this may be, I do not\nwish to enter into details, as these matters, like many others, had\nbeen arranged by His Excellency the Governor and the Council without\nmy knowledge or advice.Your Honours must await an answer from His\nExcellency the Governor Gerrit de Heere and the Council of Colombo,\nand follow the instructions they will send with regard to the said\ncheques; and the same course may be followed as regards the cheques\nof two other merchants who may arrive here just about the time of my\ndeparture.I cannot specify the amount here, as I did not see these\npeople for want of time.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.The merchants of Golconda have also requested\nthat, as they have no broker to deal with, they may be allowed an\nadvance by the Company in case they run short of cash, which request\nhas been communicated in our letter to Colombo of the 4th instant.I.--As we had only provision of rice for this Commandement for\nabout nine months, application has been made to Negapatam for 20,000\nparas of rice, but a vessel has since arrived at Kayts from Bengal,\nbelonging to the Nabob of Kateck, by name Kaimgaarehen, and loaded as\nI am informed with very good rice.If this be so, the grain might be\npurchased on behalf of the Company, and in that case the order for\nnely from Negapatam could be countermanded.It must be remembered,\nhowever, that the rice from Bengal cannot be stored away, but must\nbe consumed as soon as possible, which is not the case with that of\nNegapatam.The people from Bengal must be well treated and assisted\nwherever possible without prejudice to the Company; so that they\nmay be encouraged to come here more often and thus help us to make\nprovision for the need of grain, which is always a matter of great\nconcern here.I have already treated of the Moorish trade and also\nof the trade in grain between Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and will\nonly add here that since the arrival of the said vessel the price\nhas been reduced from 6 to 5 and 4 fannums the para.K.--On my return from Colombo last year the bargemen of the Company's\npontons submitted a petition in which they complained that they had\nbeen obliged to make good the value of all the rice that had been lost\nabove 1 per cent.from the cargoes that had been transported from\nKayts to the Company's stores.They complained that the measuring\nhad not been done fairly, and that a great deal had been blown away\nby the strong south-west winds; also that there had been much dust in\nthe nely, and that besides this it was impossible for them to prevent\nthe native crew who had been assigned to them from stealing the grain\nboth by day and night, especially since rice had become so expensive\non account of the scarcity.I appointed a Committee to investigate\nthis matter, but as it has been postponed through my illness, Your\nHonours must now take the matter in hand and have it decided by\nthe Council.In future such matters must always be brought before\nthe Council, as no one has the right to condemn others on his own\nauthority.The excuse of the said bargemen does not seem to carry\nmuch weight, but they are people who have served the Company for 30\nor 40 years and have never been known to commit fraud.It must also\nbe made a practice in future that these people are held responsible\nfor their cargo only till they reach the harbour where it is unloaded,\nas they can only guard it on board of their vessels.L.--I have spoken before of the suspicion I had with regard to the\nchanging of golden Pagodas, and with a view to have more security in\nfuture I have ordered the cashier Bout to accept no Pagodas except\ndirectly from the Accountant at Negapatam, who is responsible for the\nvalue of the Pagodas.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.He must send them to the cashier in packets of\n100 at a time, which must be sealed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.M.--The administration of the entire Commandement having been left by\nme to the Opperkoopman and Dessave Mr.Ryklof de Bitter and the other\nmembers of the Council, this does not agree with the orders from the\nSupreme Government of India contained in their letter of October 19\nlast year, but since the Dessave de Bitter has since been appointed as\nthe chief of the Committee for the pearl fishery and has left already,\nit will be for His Excellency the Governor and the Council to decide\nwhether the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz is to be entrusted with the\nadministration, as was done last year.Wishing Your Honours for the second time God's blessing,\n\n\nI remain,\nYours faithfully,\n(Signed) H.

Instructions of Commandeur\n    Hendrick Zwaardecroon, for the guidance of the Opperkoopman\n    Mr.Ryklof de Bitter, Second in authority and Dessave of the\n    Commandement, and the other members of the Political Council of\n    Jaffnapatam.Where the notes contradict the Instructions the orders\n    conveyed by the former are to be followed.In other respects the\n    Instructions must be observed, as approved by Their Excellencies\n    the Governor-General and the Council of India.The form of Government, as approved at the time mentioned here, must\nbe also observed with regard to the Dessave and Secunde, Mr.Ryklof\nde Bitter, as has been confirmed by the Honourable the Government of\nBatavia in their special letter of October 19 last.What is stated here is reasonable and in compliance with the\nInstructions, but with regard to the recommendation to send to\nMr.Zwaardecroon by Manaar and Tutucorin advices and communications\nof all that transpires in this Commandement, I think it would be\nsufficient, as Your Honours have also to give an account to us, and\nthis would involve too much writing, to communicate occasionally\nand in general terms what is going on, and to send him a copy of\nthe Compendium which is yearly compiled for His Excellency the\nGovernor.de Bitter and the other members of\nCouncil to do.The Wanni, the largest territory here, has been divided by the\nCompany into several Provinces, which have been given in usufruct to\nsome Majoraals, who bear the title of Wannias, on the condition that\nthey should yearly deliver to the Company 42 1/2

up their tribute; but on the contrary,\nas has been shown in the annexed Memoir, they allow them to go on\nincreasing.This is the reason I would not suffer the indignity of\nrequesting payment from them, but told them seriously that this would\nbe superfluous in the case of men of their eminence; which they,\nhowever, entirely ignored.I then exhorted them in the most serious\nterms to pay up their dues, saying that I would personally come within\na year to see whether they had done so.As this was also disregarded,\nI dismissed them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,\nwho owed 57 1/2 alias, made the excuse that these arrears were caused\nby the bad terms on which they were with each other, and asked that\nI would dissociate them, so that each could pay his own tribute.I\nagreed that they should arrange with the Dessave about the different\nlands, writing down on ola the arrangements made, and submitting them\nto me for approval; but as I have heard no more about the matter up\nto the present day, I fear that they only raised these difficulties\nto make believe that they were unable to pay, and to try to get the\nCompany again to discharge them from the delivery of their tribute\nof 21 elephants for next year.It would perhaps be better to do this\nthan to be continually fooled by these people.But you have all\nseen how tremblingly they appeared before me (no doubt owing to a\nbad conscience), and how they followed the palanquin of the Dessave\nlike boys, all in order to obtain more favourable conditions; but I\nsee no reason why they should not pay, and think they must be urged\nto do so.They have promised however to pay up their arrears as soon\nas possible, so that we will have to wait and see; while Don Diogo\nPoevenelle Mapane also has to deliver his 23 alias.In compliance with\nthe orders from Colombo of May 11, 1696, Don Philip Nellamapane will be\nallowed to sell one elephant yearly to the Moors, on the understanding\nthat he had delivered his tribute, and not otherwise; while the sale\nmust be in agreement with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia,\ncontained in their letter of November 13, 1683.The other Provinces,\nCarnamelpattoe, Tinnemerwaddoe, and Moeliawalle are doing fairly well,\nand the tribute for these has been paid; although it is rather small\nand consists only of 9 1/2 alias (elephants), which the Wannias there,\nhowever, deliver regularly, or at least do not take very long in\ndoing so.Perhaps they could furnish more elephants in lieu of the\ntithes of the harvest, and it would not matter if the whole of it\nwere paid in this way, because this amount could be made up for by\nsupplies from the lands of Colombo, Galle, and Matara, or a larger\nquantity could be ordered overland.That the Master of the Hunt, Don Gasper Nitchenchen Aderayen, should,\nas if he were a sovereign, have put to death a Lascoreen and a hunter\nunder the old Don Gaspar on his own responsibility, is a matter which\nwill result in very bad consequences; but I have heard rumours to\nthe effect that it was not his work, but his father's (Don Philip\nNellamapane).With regard to these people Your Honours must observe\nthe Instructions of Mr.Zwaardecroon, and their further actions must be\nwatched; because of their conspiracies with the Veddas, in one of which\nthe brother of Cottapulle Odiaar is said to have been killed.Time\ndoes not permit it, otherwise I would myself hold an inquiry.Mantotte, Moesely, and Pirringaly, which Provinces are ruled by\nofficers paid by the Company, seem to be doing well; because the\nCompany received from there a large number of elephants, besides the\ntithes of the harvest, which are otherwise drawn by the Wannias.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.The\ntwo Wannias, Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar, complain that\nthey do not receive the tribute of two elephants due to them from the\ninhabitants of Pirringaly, but I do not find in the decree published\nby Commandeur Blom on June 11, 1693, in favour of the inhabitants,\nany statement that they owe such tribute for liberation from the rule\nof the Wannias, but only that they (these Wannias) will be allowed\nto capture elephants.These Wannias, however, sent me a dirty little\ndocument, bearing date May 12, 1694, in which it is stated that the\nhunters of Pirringaly had delivered at Manaar for Pannengamo in the\nyear 1693 two alias, each 4-3/8 cubits high.If more evidence could be\nfound, it might be proved that such payment of 2 alias yearly really\nhad to be made, and it would be well for Your Honours to investigate\nthis matter, because it is very necessary to protect and assist the\nhunters as much as possible, as a reward for their diligence in the\ncapture of elephants.Payment must be made to them in compliance with\nthe orders of His Excellency van Mydregt.Ponneryn, the third Province from which elephants should\nbe obtained, and which, like Illepoecarwe, Polweraincattoe, and\nMantotte, was ruled formerly by an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave,\nwas doing fairly well; because the Company received yearly on an\naverage no less than 25 alias, besides the tithes of the harvest,\nuntil in 1690 the mode of government was changed, and the revenue of\nPonneryn was granted by public decree to the young Don Gaspar by the\nLord Commissioner van Mydregt, while those of the other two Provinces\nwere granted to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that the young Don\nGaspar would capture and deliver to the Company all elephants which\ncould be obtained in the said Provinces, while the inhabitants of\nPonneryn would be obliged to obey the Master of the Hunt as far as\ntheir services should be required by the Company and as they had been\naccustomed to render.This new arrangement did not prove a success;\nbecause, during seven years, he only delivered 44 elephants, although\nin the annexed Memoir it is stated that he delivered 74.Of these 44\nanimals, 7 were tuskers and 37 alias, viz.For 1690                4\n                    1691-92             6\n                    1692-93             5\n                    1693-94            16\n                    1694-95            13\n                                      ====\n                             Total     44\n\n\nDuring the last two years he did not deliver a single animal,\nso that the Company lost on account of this Master of the Hunt,\n131 elephants.He only appropriated the tithes of the harvest, and\ndid not care in the least about the hunt, so that the Company is even\nprevented from obtaining what it would have received by the old method;\nand, I must say, I do not understand how these privileges have been\ngranted so long where they are so clearly against the interest of the\nCompany, besides being the source of unlawful usurpation practised\nover the inhabitants, which is directly against the said deeds of\ngift.The elephant hunters have repeatedly applied to be relieved of\ntheir authority and to be allowed to serve again under the Company.For\nthese reasons, as Your Honour is aware, I have considered it necessary\nfor the service of the Company to provisionally appoint the sergeant\nAlbert Hendriksz, who, through his long residence in these Provinces,\nhas gained a great deal of experience, Adigar over Ponneryn; which\nwas done at the request of the elephant hunters.He will continue the\ncapture of elephants with the hunters without regard to the Master of\nthe Hunt, and Your Honour must give him all the assistance required,\nbecause the hunt has been greatly neglected.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.Your Honour may allow\nboth the Don Gaspars to draw the tithes of the harvest until our\nauthorities at Batavia will have disposed of this matter.The trade in elephants is undoubtedly the most important, as\nthe rest does not amount to much more than Rds.7,000 to 9,000 a\nyear.During the year 1695-1696 the whole of the sale amounted to\nFl.33,261.5, including a profit of Fl.We find it stated\nin the annexed Memoir that the merchants spoilt their own market by\nbidding against each other at the public auctions, but whether this\nwas really the case we will not discuss here.I positively disapprove\nof the complicated and impractical way in which this trade has been\ncarried on for some years, and which was opposed to the interests\nof the Company.I therefore considered it necessary to institute\nthe public auctions, by which, compared with the former method, the\nCompany has already gained a considerable amount; which is, however,\nno more than what it was entitled to, without it being of the least\nprejudice to the trade.I will not enlarge on this subject further,\nas all particulars relating to it and everything connected with it may\nbe found in our considerations and speculations and in the decisions\narrived at in accordance therewith, which are contained in the daily\nresolutions from July 24 to August 20 inclusive, a copy of which was\nleft with Your Honours, and to which I refer you.As to the changed\nmethods adopted this year, these are not to be altered by any one\nbut Their Excellencies at Batavia, whose orders I will be obliged\nand pleased to receive.As a number of elephants was sold last year\nfor the sum of Rds.53,357, it was a pity that they could not all\nbe transported at once, without a number of 126 being left behind on\naccount of the northern winds.We have therefore started the sale a\nlittle earlier this year, and kept the vessels in readiness, so that\nall the animals may be easily transported during August next.On the\n20th of this month all purchasers were, to their great satisfaction,\nready to depart, and requested and obtained leave to do so.This year\nthe Company sold at four different auctions the number of 86 elephants\nfor the sum of Rds.36,950, 16 animals being left unsold for want of\ncash among the purchasers, who are ready to depart with about 200\nanimals which they are at present engaged in putting on board.The\npractice of the early preparation of vessels and the holding of\npublic auctions must be always observed, because it is a great loss\nto the merchants to have to stay over for a whole year, while the\nCompany also suffers thereby, because in the meantime the animals\ndo not change masters.It is due to this reason and to the want of\nready cash that this year 16 animals were left unsold.In future it\nmust be a regular practice in Ceylon to have all the elephants that\nare to be sold brought to these Provinces before July 1, so that all\npreparations may be made to hold the auctions about the middle of July,\nor, if the merchants do not arrive so soon, on August 1.Meanwhile\nall the required vessels must be got ready, so that no animals need be\nleft behind on account of contrary winds.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.As we have now cut a road,\nby which the elephants may be led from Colombo, Galle, and Matura,\nas was done successfully one or two months ago, when in two trips\nfrom Matura, Galle, Colombo, Negombo, and Putulang were brought here\nwith great convenience the large number of 63 elephants, the former\nplan of transporting the animals in native vessels from Galle and\nColombo can be dropped now, a few experiments having been made and\nproving apparently unsuccessful.It must be seen that at least 12 or\n15 elephants are trained for the hunt, as a considerable number is\nalways required, especially if the animals from Putulang have to be\nfetched by land.For this reason I have ordered that two out of the 16\nanimals that were left from the sale and who have some slight defects,\nbut which do not unfit them for this work, should be trained, viz.,\nNo 22, 5 3/8 cubits high, and No.72, 5 1/2 cubits high, which may\nbe employed to drive the other animals.Meanwhile the Dessave must\nsee that the two animals which, as he is aware, were lent to Don\nDiogo, are returned to the Company.These animals were not counted\namong those belonging to the Company, which was very careless.As is\nknown to Your Honours, we have abolished the practice of branding the\nanimals twice with the mark circled V, as was done formerly, once when\nthey were sent to these Provinces and again when they were sold, and\nconsider it better to mark them only once with a number, beginning\nwith No.1, 2, 3, &c., up to No.Ten iron brand numbers have\nbeen made for this purpose.If there are more than 100 animals, they\nmust begin again with number 1, and as a mark of distinction a cross\nmust be put after each number, which rule must be observed in future,\nespecially as the merchants were pleased with it and as it is the best\nway of identifying the animals.We trust that with the opening of the\nKing's harbours the plan of obtaining the areca-nut from the King's\nterritory by water will be unnecessary, but the plan of obtaining\nthese nuts by way of the Wanni will be dealt with in the Appendix.The trade with the Moors from Bengal must be protected, and these\npeople fairly and reasonably dealt with, so that we may secure the\nnecessary supply of grain and victuals.We do not see any reason\nwhy these and other merchants should not be admitted to the sale of\nelephants, as was done this year, when every one was free to purchase\nas he pleased.The people of Dalpatterau only spent half of their\ncash, because they wished to wait till next year for animals which\nshould be more to their liking.His Excellency the High Commissioner\ninformed me that he had invited not only the people from Golconda,\nbut also those of Tanhouwer, [70] &c., to take part in that trade,\nand this may be done, especially now that the prospects seem to all\nappearances favourable; while from the districts of Colombo, Galle,\nand Matura a sufficient number of elephants may be procured to make\nup for the deficiency in Jaffnapatam, if we only know a year before\nwhat number would be required, which must be always inquired into.As the Manaar chanks are not in demand in Bengal, we have kept here a\nquantity of 36 1/2 Couren of different kinds, intending to sell in the\nusual commercial way to the Bengal merchants here present; but they\ndid not care to take it, and said plainly that the chanks were not of\nthe required size or colour; they must therefore be sent to Colombo by\nthe first opportunity, to be sent on to Bengal next year to be sold at\nany price, as this will be better than having them lying here useless.The subject of the inhabitants has been treated of in such a way\nthat it is unnecessary for me to add anything.With regard to the tithes, I agree with Mr.Zwaardecroon that\nthe taxes need not be reduced, especially as I never heard that the\ninhabitants asked for this to be done.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.It will be the duty of the\nDessave to see that the tenth of the harvest of the waste lands,\nwhich were granted with exemption of taxes for a certain period, is\nbrought into the Company's stores after the stated period has expired.Poll tax.--It is necessary that a beginning should be made with\nthe work of revising the Head Thombo, and that the names of the old\nand infirm people and of those that have died should be taken off the\nlist, while the names of the youths who have reached the required age\nare entered.This renovation should take place once in three years,\nand the Dessave as Land Regent should sometimes assist in this work.Officie Gelden.--It will be very well if this be divided according\nto the number of people in each caste, so that each individual pays\nhis share, instead of the amount being demanded from each caste as\na whole, because it is apparent that the Majoraals have profited by\nthe old method.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.No remarks are at present necessary with regard to the Adigary.The Oely service, imposed upon those castes which are bound to\nserve, must be

fanam, [71] is not bad, but I found this to be the practise\nalready for many years, as may be seen from the annexed account of two\nparties of men who had been absent, which most likely was overlooked\nby mistake.This is yet stronger evidence that the circumstances\nof the inhabitants have improved, and I therefore think it would be\nwell to raise the chicos from 4 stivers to 6 stivers or 1 1/2 fanam,\nwith a view to finding out whether the men will then be more diligent\nin the performance of their duty; because the work must be carried on\nby every possible means.Your Honours are again seriously recommended\nto see that the sicos or fines specified in the annexed Memoir are\ncollected without delay, and also the amount still due for 1693,\nbecause such delay cannot but be prejudicial to the Company.The old\nand infirm people whose names are not entered in the new Thombo must\nstill deliver mats, and kernels for coals for the smith's shop.No\nobjections will be raised to this if they see that we do not slacken\nin our supervision.Tax Collectors and Majoraals.--The payment of the taxes does not\nseem satisfactory, because only Rds.180 have been paid yet out of\nthe Rds.2,975.1 due as sicos for the year 1695.It would be well\nif these officers could be transferred according to the Instructions\nof 1673 and 1675.It used to be the practice to transfer them every\nthree years; but I think it will be trouble in vain now, because when\nan attempt was made to have these offices filled by people of various\ncastes, it caused such commotion and uproar that it was not considered\nadvisable to persist in this course except where the interest of the\nCompany made it strictly necessary.Perhaps a gradual change could\nbe brought about by filling the places of some of the Bellales when\nthey die by persons of other castes, which I think could be easily\ndone.Zwaardecroon seems to think it desirable that\nthe appointment of new officials for vacancies and the issuing of\nthe actens should be deferred till his return from Mallabaar or\nuntil another Commandeur should come over, we trust that he does\nnot mean that these appointments could not be made by the Governor\nof the Island or by the person authorized by him to do so.If the\nCommandeur were present, such appointment should not be made without\nhis knowledge, especially after the example of the commotion caused\nby the transfer of these officers in this Commandement, but in order\nthat Your Honours may not be at a loss what to do, it will be better\nfor you not to wait for the return of Mr.Zwaardecroon from Mallabaar,\nnor for the arrival of any other Commandeur, but to refer these and\nall other matters concerning this Commandement, which is subordinate\nto us, to Colombo to the Governor and Council, so that proper advice\nin debita forma may be given.The Lascoreens certainly make better messengers than soldiers.The\nDessave must therefore maintain discipline among them, and take\ncare that no men bound to perform other duties are entered as\nLascoreens.This they often try to bring about in order to be\nexcused from labour, and the Company is thus deprived of labourers\nand is put to great inconvenience.I noticed this to be the case in\nColombo during the short time I was in Ceylon, when the labour had to\nbe supplied by the Company's slaves.There seems to be no danger of\nanother famine for some time, as the crop in Coromandel has turned out\nvery well.We cannot therefore agree to an increase of pay, although\nit is true that the present wages of the men are very low.It must\nbe remembered, however, that they are also very simple people, who\nhave but few wants, and are not always employed in the service of\nthe Company; so that they may easily earn something besides if they\nare not too lazy.We will therefore keep their wages for the present\nat the rate they have been at for so many years; especially because\nit is our endeavour to reduce the heavy expenditure of the Company\nby every practicable means.We trust that there was good reason why\nthe concession made by His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor\nof India, Mr.Laurens Pyl, in favour of the Lascoreens has not been\nexecuted, and we consider that on account of the long interval that\nhas elapsed it is no longer of application.The proposal to transfer\nthe Lascoreens in this Commandement twice, or at least once a year,\nwill be a good expedient for the reasons stated.The importation of slaves from the opposite coast seems to be most\nprofitable to the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam, as no less a number\nthan 3,584 were brought across in two years' time, for which they\npaid 9,856 guilders as duty.It would be better if they imported a\nlarger quantity of rice or nely, because there is so often a scarcity\nof food supplies here.It is also true that the importation of so many\nslaves increases the number of people to be fed, and that the Wannias\ncould make themselves more formidable with the help of these men, so\nthat there is some reason for the question whether the Company does\nnot run the risk of being put to inconvenience with regard to this\nCommandement.Considering also that the inhabitants have suffered\nfrom chicken-pox", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "As to the larger importation on account of the famine on the\nopposite coast, where these creatures were to be had for a handful of\nrice, this will most likely cease now, after the better harvest.The\ndanger with regard to the Wannias I do not consider so very great, as\nthe rule of the Company is such that the inhabitants prefer it to the\nextreme hardships they had to undergo under the Wannia chiefs, and they\nwould kill them if not for fear of the power of the Company.Therefore\nI think it unnecessary to have any apprehension on this score.Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting,\nnot only in Jaffnapatam, but throughout Ceylon all over the Company's\nterritory, and therefore the officers of the Government must constantly\nguard against a monopoly being made of this grain.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.This opportunity\nis taken to recommend the matter to Your Honours as regards this\nCommandement.I do not consider any remarks necessary with regard to the\nnative trade.I agree, however, with the method practised by\nMr.Zwaardecroon in order to prevent the monopoly of grain, viz.,\nthat all vessels returning with grain, which the owners take to Point\nPedro, Tellemanaar, and Wallewitteture, often under false pretexts,\nin order to hide it there, should be ordered to sail to Kayts.This\nmatter is recommended to Your Honours' attention.With regard to the coconut trees, we find that more difficulties\nare raised about the order from Colombo of October 13 last, for the\ndelivery of 24 casks of coconut oil, than is necessary, considering\nthe large number of trees found in this country.It seems to me that\nthis could be easily done; because, according to what is published from\ntime to time, and from what is stated in the Pass Book, it appears that\nduring the period of five years 1692 to 1696 inclusive, a number of\n5,397,800 of these nuts were exported, besides the quantity smuggled\nand the number consumed within this Commandement.Calculating that\none cask, or 400 cans of 10 quarterns, of oil can be easily drawn from\n5,700 coconuts (that is to say, in Colombo: in this Commandement 6,670\nnuts would be required for the same quantity, and thus, for the whole\nsupply of 24 casks, 160,080 nuts would be necessary), I must say I do\nnot understand why this order should be considered so unreasonable,\nand why the Company's subjects could not supply this quantity for\ngood payment.Instead of issuing licenses for the export of the nuts\nit will be necessary to prohibit it, because none of either of the\nkinds of oil demanded has been delivered.I do not wish to express\nmy opinion here, but will only state that shortly after my arrival,\nI found that the inhabitants on their own account gladly delivered the\noil at the Company's stores at the rate of 3 fanams or Rd.1/4 per\nmarcal of 36 quarterns, even up to 14 casks, and since then, again,\n10 casks have been delivered, and they still continue to do so.They\nalso delivered 3 amen of margosa oil, while the Political Council\nwere bold enough to assert in their letter of April 4 last that it\nwas absolutely impossible to send either of the two kinds of oil,\nthe excuse being that they had not even sufficient for their own\nrequirements.How far this statement can be relied upon I will not\ndiscuss here; but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful\nand energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary\ncorrespondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave\nis present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel\ntools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended\nhere must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and\nPalecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the\nSupreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should\nbe purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large\ndemand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking\nthat the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of\nthan that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no\nmore than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was\nby no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable\nwood had to be used.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.We also had to obtain laths from private persons\nat Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore\nspecially request that during the next northern monsoon the following\nare sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary\nbuilding operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in\ntwo kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,\nthree out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that\nthis timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the\nsupervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to\nany inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such\na person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,\nand the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under\nthe heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound\nto deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as\na substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were\nsent last January as promised to Your Honour.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience\nthan of importance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting\nthis duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the\nother hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well\nif it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers\nwould not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,\nas that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of\ncost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000\nparas from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in\npayment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that\nany amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed\nby Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.But as\nanother order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel\nfor 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way\nthat I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would\nadd some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my\ndoing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of\nforeign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,\nmust be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth\n(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20\nper cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term\nat the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated\nin the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are\nprospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in\nfuture, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been\ngiven here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further\ncomments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders\nat the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.Zwaardecroon\nreduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed\nto the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders\nfrom the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution\nof 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;\nbecause, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to\n14,118.11.8 guilders.The account at present is as follows:--\n\n\n                                                     Guilders.[74]\n    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8\n    The Province of Patchelepalle                    579.10.0\n    Tandua Moeti and Nagachitty (weavers)          2,448.13.0\n    Manuel of Anecotta                             8,539.6.0\n    The Tannecares caste

     ===========\n                                      Total       14,118.11.8\n\n\nHerein is not included the Fl.167.15 which again has been paid to\nthe weavers Tandua Moeti and Naga Chitty on account of the Company for\nthe delivery of Salampoeris, while materials have been issued to them\nlater on.It is not with my approval that these poor people continue\nto be employed in the weaving of cloth, because the Salampoeris which I\nhave seen is so inferior a quality and uneven that I doubt whether the\nCompany will make any profit on it; especially if the people should\nget into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash\nissued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from\nBatavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,\nthat Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of\nby Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,\nbut I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,\nand inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.Meantime,\nYour Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not\nact prejudicially to the Company.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.At present their debt is 2,448.13\nguilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,\nand no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be\nemployed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.I do not think they\nneed be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their\nbeing discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the\nnatives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which\nwould be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so\nmany other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his\nlarge number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also\nopenly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid\nthe vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of\nChristianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference\nwhether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of\nJaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,\nfor whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously\nenlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their\ninstruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6\nguilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the\ninstructions.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11\nelephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced\nto him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.150 from\nthe Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but\nthat the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,\nbut with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of\nthe Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the\nThombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already\nemployed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is\nbest to make as few changes as possible.The instructions with regard\nto the passports must be followed pending further orders.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the\nCourt of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins\nof Government, and that was only recently.I have besides no sufficient\nknowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse\nthe documents referred to.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,\nbut in case Mr.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time\n(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation\nof the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the\nsurveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,\nbut every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In\ncase of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas\nIsaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties\nthere, Lieut.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the\nPolitical Council, could be appointed for the time; because the time\nof the Dessave will be taken up with the supervision of the usual work\nat the Castle.I think that there are several law books in stock in\nColombo, of which some will be sent for the use of the Court of Justice\nby the first opportunity; as it appears that different decisions have\nbeen made in similar cases among the natives.Great precaution must\nbe observed, and the documents occasionally submitted to us.I think\nthat the number of five Lascoreens and six Caffirs will be sufficient\nfor the assistance of the Fiscaal.I will not make any remarks here on the subject of religion, but\nwill refer to my annotations under the heading of Outstanding Debts.I agree with all that has been stated here with regard to the\nSeminary and need not add anything further, except that I think this\nlarge school and church require a bell, which may be rung on Sundays\nfor the services and every day to call the children to school and\nto meals.As there are bells in store, the Dessave must be asked to\nsee that one is put up, either at the entrance of the church on some\nsteps, or a little more removed from the door, or wherever it may be\nconsidered to be most convenient and useful.All that is said here with regard to the Consistory I can only\nconfirm.I approve of the advice given to the Dessave to see to the\nimprovement of the churches and the houses belonging thereto; but I\nhave heard that the neglect has extended over a long period and the\ndecay is very serious.It should have been the duty of the Commandeur\nto prevent their falling into ruin.The Civil or Landraad ought to hold its sittings as stated in the\nMemoir.I am very much surprised to find that this Court is hardly\nworthy of the name of Court any more, as not a single sitting has been\nheld or any case heard since March 21, 1696.It appears that these\nsittings were not only neglected during the absence of the Commandeur\nin Colombo, but even after his return and since his departure for\nMallabaar, and it seems that they were not even thought of until my\narrival here.This shows fine government indeed, considering also\nthat the election of the double number of members for this College had\ntwice taken place, the members nominated and the list sent to Colombo\nwithout a single meeting being held.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.It seems to me incomprehensible,\nand as it is necessary that this Court should meet again once every\nweek without fail, the Dessave, as chief in this Commandement when the\nCommandeur is absent, is entrusted with the duty of seeing that this\norder is strictly observed.As Your Honours are aware, I set apart a\nmeeting place both for this Court as well as the Court of Justice,\nnamely, the corner house next to the house of the Administrateur\nBiermans, consisting of one large and one small room, while a roof has\nbeen built over the steps.This, though not of much pretension, will\nquite do, and I consider it unnecessary to build so large a building as\nproposed either for this Court or for the Scholarchen.The scholarchial\nmeetings can be held in the same place as those of the Consistory,\nas is done in Colombo and elsewhere, and a large Consistory has been\nbuilt already for the new church.As it is not necessary now to put up\na special building for those assemblies, I need not point out here the\nerrors in the plan proposed, nor need I state how I think such a place\nshould be arranged.I have also been averse to such a building being\nerected so far outside the Castle and in a corner where no one comes\nor passes, and I consider it much better if this is done within the\nCastle.There is a large square adjoining the church, where a whole\nrow of buildings might be put up.It is true that no one may erect\nnew buildings on behalf of the Company without authority and special\norders from Batavia.I have to recommend that this order be strictly\nobserved.Whether or not the said foul pool should be filled up I\ncannot say at present, as it would involve no little labour to do so.I approve of the advice given in the annexed Memoir with regard\nto the Orphan Chamber.I agree with this passage concerning the Commissioners of Marriage\nCauses, except that some one else must be appointed in the place of\nLieutenant Claas Isaacsz if necessary.Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and Wardens of the Town.As stated here, the deacons have a deficit of Rds.1,145.3.7 over\nthe last five and half years, caused by the building of an Orphanage\nand the maintenance of the children.At present there are 18 orphans,\n10 boys and 8 girls, and for such a small number certainly a large\nbuilding and great expenditure is unnecessary.As the deficit has been\nchiefly caused by the building of the Orphanage, which is paid for\nnow, and as the Deaconate has invested a large capital, amounting to\nFl.40,800, on interest in the Company, I do not see the necessity of\nfinding it some other source of income, as it would have to be levied\nfrom the inhabitants or paid by the Company in some way or other.No more sums on interest are to be received in deposit on behalf\nof the Company, in compliance with the instructions referred to.What is stated here with regard to the money drafts must be\nobserved.Golden Pagodas.--I find a notice, bearing date November 18,\n1695, giving warning against the introduction of Pagodas into this\ncountry.It does not seem to have had much effect, as there seems\nto be a regular conspiracy and monopoly among the chetties and other\nrogues.This ought to be stopped, and I have therefore ordered that\nnone but the Negapatam and Palliacatte Pagodas will be current at 24\nfannums or Rds.2, while it will be strictly prohibited to give in\npayment or exchange any other Pagodas, whether at the boutiques or\nanywhere else, directly or indirectly, on penalty of the punishment\nlaid down in the statutes.Your Honours must see that this rule\nis observed, and care must be taken that no payment is made to the\nCompany's servants in coin on which they would have to lose.The applications from outstations.--The rules laid down in the\nannexed Memoir must be observed.With regard to the Company's sloops and other vessels, directions\nare given here as to how they are employed, which directions must be\nstill observed.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.Further information or instructions may be obtained\nfrom Colombo.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.The Fortifications.--I think it would be preferable to leave the\nfortifications of the Castle of Jaffnapatam as they are, instead\nof raising any points or curtains.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk.But improvements may be made,\nsuch as the alteration of the embrazures, which are at present on the\noutside surrounded by coral stone and chunam, and are not effective,\nas I noticed that at the firing of the salute on my arrival, wherever\nthe canons were fired the coral stone had been loosened and in some\nplaces even thrown down.The sentry boxes also on the outer points\nof the flank and face had been damaged.These embrazures would be\nvery dangerous for the sentry in case of an attack, as they would\nnot stand much firing.I think also that the stone flooring for the\nartillery ought to be raised a little, or, in an emergency, boards\ncould be placed underneath the canon, which would also prevent the\nstones being crushed by the wheels.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.I noticed further that each canon\nstands on a separate platform, which is on a level with the floor of\nthe curtain, so that if the carriage should break when the canon are\nfired, the latter would be thrown down, and it would be with great\ndifficulty only that they could be replaced on their platform.It\nwould be much safer if the spaces between these platforms were filled\nup.The ramparts are all right, but the curtain <DW72>s too much;\nthis was done most likely with a view of permitting the shooting with\nmuskets at even a closer range than half-way across the moat.This\ndeficiency might be rectified by raising the earthen wall about\nhalf a foot.These are the chief deficiencies I noticed, which could\nbe easily rectified.With regard to the embrazures, I do not know at\npresent whether it would be safer to follow the plan of the Commandeur\nor that of the Constable-Major Toorse.For the present I have ordered\nthe removal of the stones and their replacement by grass sods, which\ncan be fixed on the earthen covering of the ramparts.Some of the\nsoldiers well experienced in this work are employed in doing this,\nand I think that it will be far more satisfactory than the former plan,\nwhich was only for show.The sentry boxes had better be built inside,\nand the present passage to them from the earthen wall closed up, and\nthey must be built so that they would not be damaged by the firing of\nthe canon.The Dessave has been instructed to see that the different\nplatforms for the artillery are made on one continuous floor, which\ncan be easily done, as the spaces between them are but very small\nand the materials are at hand.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.I wish the deficiencies outside the fort could be remedied as well\nas those within it.The principal defect is that the moat serves as\nyet very little as a safeguard, and it seems as if there is no hope\nof its being possible to dig it sufficiently deep, considering that\nexperiments have been made with large numbers of labourers and yet the\nwork has advanced but little.When His Excellency the Honourable the\nCommissioner van Mydregt was in Jaffnapatam in 1690, he had this work\ncontinued for four or five weeks by a large number of people, but he\nhad to give it up, and left no instructions as far as is known.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.The\nchief difficulty is the very hard and large rocks enclosed in the\ncoral stone, which cannot be broken by any instrument and have to\nbe blasted.This could be successfully done in the upper part, but\nlower down beneath the water level the gunpowder cannot be made to\ntake fire.As this is such an important work, I think orders should\nbe obtained from Batavia to carry on this work during the dry season\nwhen the water is lowest; because at that time also the people are\nnot engaged in the cultivation of fields, so that a large number\nof labourers could be obtained.The blasting of the rocks was not\nundertaken at first for fear of damage to the fortifications, but\nas the moat has been dug at a distance of 10 roods from the wall,\nit may be 6 or 7 roods wide and a space would yet remain of 3 or\n4 roods.This, in my opinion, would be the only effectual way of\ncompleting the work, provision being made against the rushing in of the\nwater, while a sufficient number of tools, such as shovels, spades,\n&c., must be kept at hand for the breaking of the coral stones.It\nwould be well for the maintenance of the proper depth to cover both\nthe outer and inner walls with coral stone, as otherwise this work\nwould be perfectly useless.With regard to the high grounds northward and southward of the town,\nthis is not very considerable, and thus not a source of much danger.I\nadmit, however, that it would be better if they were somewhat lower,\nbut the surface is so large that I fear it would involve a great\ndeal of labour and expenditure.In case this were necessary, it would\nbe just as important that the whole row of buildings right opposite\nthe fort in the town should be broken down.I do not see the great\nnecessity for either, while moreover, the soil consists of sand and\nstone, which is not easily dug.With regard to the horse stables and\nthe carpenters' yard just outside the gate of the Castle, enclosed\nby a wall, the river, and the moat of the Castle, which is deepest\nin that place (although I did not see much water in it), I think it\nwould have been better if they had been placed elsewhere; but yet I\ndo not think they are very dangerous to the fort, especially as that\ncorner can be protected from the points Hollandia and Gelria; while,\nmoreover, the roof of the stable and the walls towards the fort could\nbe broken down on the approach of an enemy; for, surely no one could\ncome near without being observed.As these buildings have been only\nnewly erected, they will have to be used, in compliance with the\norders from Batavia.Thus far as to my advice with regard to this fort; but I do not mean to\noppose the proposals of the Commandeur.I will only state here that I\nfound the moat of unequal breadth, and in some places only half as wide\nas it ought to be, of which no mention is made here.In some places\nalso it is not sufficiently deep to turn the water by banks or keep it\nfour or five feet high by water-mills.Even if this were so, I do not\nthink the water could be retained on account of the sandy and stony\nsoil, especially as there are several low levels near by.Supposing\neven that it were possible, the first thing an enemy would do would be\nto direct a few shots of the canon towards the sluices, and thus make\nthem useless.I would therefore recommend that, if possible, the moat\nbe deepened so far during the south-west monsoon that it would be on a\nlevel with the river, by which four or six feet of water would always\nstand in it.With regard to the sowing of thorns, I fear that during\nthe dry season they would be quite parched and easily take fire.This\nproposal shows how little the work at the moat has really advanced,\nin fact, when I saw it it was dry and overgrown with grass.So long\nas the fort is not surrounded by a moat, I cannot see the necessity\nfor a drawbridge, but the Honourable the Government of India will\ndispose of this matter.Meantime I have had many improvements made,\nwhich I hope will gain the approval of Their Excellencies.The fortress Hammenhiel is very well situated for the protection\nof the harbour and the river of Kaits.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.The sand bank and the wall\ndamaged by the storm have been repaired.The height of the reservoir\nis undoubtedly a mistake, which must be altered.The gate and the part\nof the rampart are still covered with the old and decayed beams, and\nit would be well if the project of Mr.This is a\nvery necessary work, which must be hurried on as much as circumstances\npermit, and it is recommended to Your Honours' attention, because\nthe old roof threatens to break down.As I have not seen any of these places, I cannot say whether the\nwater tanks are required or not.As the work has to wait for Dutch\nbricks, it will be some time before it can be commenced, because\nthere are none in store here.Manaar is a fortress with four entire bastions.I found that the\nfull garrison, including Europeans and Mixties, [75] consists of 44\nmen, twelve or fifteen of whom are moreover usually employed in the\nadvanced guard or elsewhere.I do not therefore see the use of this\nfortress, and do not understand why instead of this fortress a redoubt\nwas not built.Having been built the matter cannot now be altered.It\nhas been stated that Manaar is an island which protects Jaffnapatam\non the south, but I cannot see how this is so.The deepening of\nthe moat cannot be carried out so soon, but the elevations may be\nremoved.Lime I consider can be burnt there in sufficient quantities,\nand my verbal orders to the Resident have been to that effect.The\npavement for the canons I found quite completed, but the floors of\nthe galleries of the dwelling houses not yet.The water reservoir\nof brick, which is on a level with the rampart, I have ordered to be\nsurrounded with a low wall, about 3 or 3 1/2 feet high, with a view\nto prevent accidents to the sentinels at night, which are otherwise\nlikely to occur.The Dessave must see whether this has been done,\nas it is not likely that I would go there again, because I intend\nreturning to Colombo by another route.Great attention should be paid to the provisions and\nammunition.The order of His Excellency van Mydregt was given as a\nwise precaution, but has proved impracticable after many years of\nexperience, as His Excellency himself was also aware, especially\nwith regard to grain and rice, on account of the variable crops to\nwhich we are subject here.However, the plan must be carried out as\nfar as possible in this Commandement, with the understanding that\nno extraordinary prices are paid for the purchase of rice; while, on\nthe other hand, care must be taken that the grain does not spoil by\nbeing kept too long; because we do not know of any kind of rice except\nthat from Coromandel which can be kept even for one year.At present\nrice and nely are easily obtained, and therefore I do not consider it\nnecessary that the people of Jaffnapatam should be obliged to deliver\ntheir rice at half per cent.The ten kegs of meat\nand ten kegs of bacon must be sent to Colombo by the first opportunity,\nto be disposed of there, if it is not spoilt (which is very much to\nbe feared).In case it is unfit for use the loss will be charged to\nthe account of this Commandement, although it has to be borne by the\nCompany all the same.Greater discrimination should be exercised in\nfuture to prevent such occurrences, and I think it would be well in\nemergencies to follow the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen, viz., to\ncapture 1,000 or 1,200 cattle around the fort and drive them inside it,\nwhile dry burs, &c., may also be collected to feed them.The arrack\nmust never be accepted until it has been proved to be good.In Batavia\nit is tested by burning it in a silver bowl, and the same ought to be\ndone here, it being tested by two Commissioners and the dispenser.In\nfuture bad arrack will be charged to the account of the person who\naccepted it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.The acceptance of inferior goods proves great negligence,\nto say the least, and Your Honours are recommended to see that these\norders are observed.It is a satisfaction to know that there is a\nsufficient stock of ammunition.An attempt must be made to repair\nthe old muskets, and those which are unfit for use must be sent to\nColombo.The storing away of fuel is a\npraiseworthy precaution; but on my arrival I found only very little\nkept here, and the space for the greater part empty.The military and the garrison are proportionately as strong here as\nin other places, the want of men being a general complaint.However,\nin order to meet this defect in some way, 34 of the military men who\ncame here with me are to remain, and also the three men whom I left\nat Manaar and appointed to that station.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.I therefore do not think it\nnecessary to employ any more oepasses, [76] especially as we intend to\nreduce the number of these people in Colombo to a great extent, so that\nif they are really required, which I cannot see yet, some of them might\nbe sent here.At present we have nothing to fear from the Sinhalese.We\nare on good terms with them, and it would be inexcusable to employ\nany new men whose maintenance would be a heavy expenditure.Strict\ndiscipline and continual military drill are very important points,\nspecially recommended to the attention of the Dessave.Public Works.--Care must be taken that no more native artisans\nare employed than is necessary, as this means a considerable daily\nexpenditure.The various recommendations on this subject must be\nobserved.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.The four old and decayed Portuguese houses, which I found\nto be in a bad condition, must be rebuilt when circumstances permit,\nand may then serve as dwellings for the clergy and other qualified\nofficers, [77] but orders from Batavia must be awaited.Meantime\nI authorize Your Honours to have the armoury rebuilt, as this is", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "I agree with the recommendations with regard to the horse stables,\nand also think that they could very well be supervised by the Chief,\nand that it is undesirable for private overseers to be employed\nfor this purpose.The stable outside the fort has been brought into\nreadiness, and it may now be considered for what purpose the stable\nin the Castle could be utilized.It is well that the floor of the hospital has been raised,\nbut the floor of the back gallery is also too low, so that it is\nalways wet whenever it rains, the water both rising from the ground\nand coming down from the roof, which has been built too flat.It is\nalso necessary that a door be made in the ante-room and the entrance\nof the gallery, in order to shut out the cold north winds, which are\nvery strong here and cause great discomfort to the patients.I also\nthink that the half walls between the rooms should be raised by a half\nstone wall up to the roof, because it is too cold as it is at present\nfor such people.These and other improvements are also recommended\nto the attention of the Dessave.It is always the case with the Company's slaves, to ask for\nhigher pay as soon as they learn a trade.I cannot countenance this\non my part, because I consider that they already receive the highest\npay allowed for a slave.They deserve no more than others who have\nto do the heaviest and dirtiest work.These also if put to the test\nwould do higher work, as experience has proved.It is true that the\nnumber here is small, but I think the rules should be the same in\nall places.As there are, however, some slaves in Colombo also who\nreceive higher pay, the wages of the man who draws 6 fanams might be\nraised to 8, 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 fanams, on the understanding that no\nincrease will be given hereafter.The emancipation of slaves and the\nintermarrying with free people has also been practised and tolerated\nin Ceylon, but whatever may be the pretext, I think it is always\nto the prejudice of the Company in the case of male slaves.In the\ncase of women without children the matter is not quite so important,\nand I would consent to it in the present case of the woman whom a\nnative proposes to marry, provided she has no children and is willing\nto place a strong and healthy substitute.Until further orders no\nmore slaves are to be emancipated or allowed to intermarry with\nfree people.Those who are no longer able to work must be excused,\nbut those who have been receiving higher pay because they know some\ntrade will, in that case, receive no more than ordinary slaves.It\nis not wise to emancipate slaves because they are old, as it might\nhave undesirable consequences, while also they might in that case\nvery soon have to be maintained by the Deaconate.It is in compliance with our orders that close regard should\nbe paid to all that passes at Manaar.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.This has been confirmed again\nby our letter of June 1, especially with a view to collect the duty\nfrom the vessels carrying cloth, areca-nut, &c., as was always done\nby the Portuguese, and formerly also by the Company during the time\nof the free trade.Further orders with regard to this matter must be\nawaited from Batavia.Meantime our provisional orders must be observed,\nand in case these are approved, it will have to be considered whether\nit would not be better to lease the Customs duty.Personally I think\nthat this would be decidedly more profitable to the Company.With regard to the ill-fated elephants, I have to seriously\nrecommend better supervision.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.It is unaccountable how so many of\nthese animals should die in the stables.Out of three or four animals\nsent to Jaffnapatam in 1685, and once even out of ten animals sent,\nonly one reached the Castle alive.If such be the case, what use is\nit to the Company for efforts to be made for the delivery of a large\nnumber of elephants?Moreover, experience proves that this need not\nbe looked upon as inevitable, because out of more than 100 elephants\nkept in the lands of Matura hardly two or three died in a whole year,\nwhile two parties of 63 animals each had been transported for more than\n120 miles by land and reached their destination quite fresh and well,\nalthough there were among these six old and decrepit and thirteen baby\nelephants, some only 3 cubits high and rather delicate.It is true, as\nhas been said, that the former animals had been captured with nooses,\nwhich would tire and harm them more than if they were caught in kraals,\nbut even then they make every effort to regain their liberty, and,\nmoreover, the kraals were in use here also formerly, and even then\na large number of the animals died.These are only vain excuses,\nfor I have been assured by the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and others\nwho have often assisted in the capture of elephants, both with nooses\nand in kraals, that these animals (which are very delicate and must\nbe carefully tended, as they cannot be without food for 24 hours)\nwere absolutely neglected both in the stables at Manaar and on the\nway.An animal of 5 or 6 cubits high is fed and attended there by only\none cooly, while each animal requires at least three coolies.They\nare only fed on grass, if it is to be had, and at most 10, 12, or\n15 olas or coconut leaves, whereas they require at least 50 or 60,\nand it is very likely that those that are being transported get still\nless, while the journey itself also does them a great deal of harm.How\nlittle regard is paid to these matters I have seen myself in the lands\nof Mantotte and elsewhere, and the Chief of Manaar, Willem de Ridder,\nwhen questioned about it, had to admit that none of the keepers or\nthose who transported the animals, who are usually intemperate and\ninexperienced toepas soldiers or Lascoreens, had ever been questioned\nor even suspected in this matter.This is neglect of the Company's\ninterests, and in future only trustworthy persons should be employed,\nand fines or corporal punishment ordered in case of failure, as the\ndeath of such a large number of elephants causes considerable loss\nto the Company.I think it would be best if the Chief of Manaar were\nheld mostly responsible for the supervision and after him the Adigar of\nMantotte.They must see that the animals are fed properly when kept in\nthe stalls during the rainy season; and these animals must always have\nmore than they eat, as they tread upon and waste part of it.During\nthe dry season the animals must be distributed over the different\nvillages in the Island, some also being sent to Carsel.Care must be\ntaken that besides the cornak [78] there are employed three parrias\n[79] for each animal to provide its food, instead of one only as at\npresent, and besides the Chief and the Adigar a trustworthy man should\nbe appointed, either a Dutch sergeant or corporal or a reliable native,\nto supervise the stalls.His duty will be to improve the stables,\nand see that they are kept clean, and that the animals are properly\nfed.The tank of Manaar, which is shallow and often polluted by\nbuffaloes, must be cleaned, deepened, and surrounded with a fence,\nand in future only used for the elephants.The Adigar must supervise\nthe transport of the elephants from Mantotte and Manaar to the Castle,\nand he must be given for his assistance all such men as he applies\nfor.At the boundary of the district of Mantotte he must give over his\ncharge to the Adigar of Pringaly, and the latter transporting them to\nthe boundary of Ponneryn must give them over to the Adigar of Ponneryn,\nand he again at the Passes to the Ensign there, who will transport them\nto the Castle.Experience will prove that in this way nearly all the\nanimals will arrive in good condition.The Dessave de Bitter is to see\nthat these orders are carried out, and he may suggest any improvements\nhe could think of, which will receive our consideration.This is\nall I have to say on the subject.It seems that the Castle, &c.,\nare mostly kept up on account of the elephants, and therefore the\nsale of these animals must counterbalance the expenditure.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.The cultivation of dye-roots is dealt with under the heading of\nthe Moorish Trade.I approve the orders from Colombo of May 17, 1695, with regard\nto the proposal by Perie Tamby, for I think that he would have looked\nfor pearl oysters more than for chanks.With regard to the pearl fishery, some changes will have to be\nmade.The orders will be sent in time from Colombo before the next\nfishery.In my Memoir, left at Colombo, I have ordered with regard\nto the proposal of the Committee that four buoys should be made as\nbeacons for the vessels, each having a chain of 12 fathoms long, with\nthe necessary adaptations in the links for turning.With regard to the\nquestion as to the prohibition of the export of coconuts on account\nof the large number of people that will collect there, I cannot see\nthat it would be necessary.When the time arrives, and it is sure\nthat a fishery will be held, Your Honours may consider the question\nonce more, and if you think it to be so, the issue of passports may\nbe discontinued for the time.Most likely a fishery will be held\nin the beginning of next year, upon which we hope God will give His\nblessing, the Company having made a profit of Fl.77,435.12 1/2 last\ntime, when only three-fourths of the work could be done on account\nof the early south-west monsoon.All particulars having been stated here with regard to the\ninhabited islets, I do not consider it necessary to make any remarks\nabout them.Horse breeding surely promises good results as stated in the\nannexed Memoir.I visited the islands De Twee Gebroeders, and saw\nabout 200 foals of one, two, and three years old.I had some caught\nwith nooses, and they proved to be of good build and of fairly\ngood race.On the island of Delft there are no less than 400 or 500\nfoals.Many of those on the islands De Twee Gebroeders will soon be\nlarge enough to be captured and trained, when 15 animals, or three\nteams, must be sent to Colombo to serve for the carriages with four\nhorses in which it is customary to receive the Kandyan ambassadors\nand courtiers.They must be good animals, and as much as possible\nalike in colour.At present we have only ten of these horses, many\nof which are too old and others very unruly, so that they are almost\nuseless.Besides these, 15 riding horses are required for the service\nof the Company in Colombo and Galle, as not a single good saddle\nhorse is to be found in either of these Commandements.Besides these,\n25 or 30 horses must be sent for sale to private persons by public\nauction, which I trust will fetch a good deal more than Rds.25 or 35,\nas they do in Coromandel.The latter prices are the very lowest at\nwhich the animals are to be sold, and none must be sold in private,\nbut always by public auction.This, I am sure, will be decidedly in the\ninterest of the Company and the fairest way of dealing.I would further\nrecommend that, as soon as possible, a stable should be built on the\nislands De Twee Gebroeders like that in Delft, or a little smaller,\nwhere the animals could be kept when captured until they are a little\ntamed, as they remain very wild for about two months.Next to this\nstable a room or small house should be built for the Netherlander to\nwhom the supervision is entrusted.At present this person, who is\nmoreover married, lives in a kind of Hottentot's lodging, which is\nvery unseemly.The Dessave must see that the inhabitants of the island\nDelft are forbidden to cultivate cotton, and that the cotton trees now\nfound there are destroyed; because the number of horses is increasing\nrapidly.The Dessave noticed only lately that large tracts of land of\ntwo, three, and more miles are thus cultivated, in direct opposition\nto the Company's orders.It seems they are not satisfied to be allowed\nto increase the number of their cattle by thousands, all of which have\nto derive their food from the island as well as the Company's horses,\nbut they must also now cultivate cotton, which cannot be tolerated\nand must be strictly prohibited.Once the horses perished for want of\nwater; on one occasion they were shot on account of crooked legs; and\nit would be gross carelessness if now they had to perish by starvation.The Passes of Colomboture, Catsjay, Ponneryn, Pyl, Elephant, and\nBeschutter; Point Pedro; the Water fortress, Kayts or Hammenhiel;\nAripo; Elipoecareve; and Palwerain-cattoe.No particular remarks\nare necessary with regard to these Passes and stations, except that\nI would recommend the Dessave, when he has an opportunity to visit\nthe redoubts Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter with an expert, to see in\nwhat way they could be best connected.I think that out of all the\ndifferent proposals that of a strong and high wall would deserve\npreference, if it be possible to collect the required materials,\nas it would have to be two miles long.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at\nhome!Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me

walls, now through the\ndim ways of an outlying hamlet.A prolonged shriek of growing fright and\nanguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the\ngreat carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a\nchamber of horrors.In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most\nfamiliar things became grotesque.A woman's voice telling stories behind\nshadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her\nlighted screen, had the effect of incantation.Before the booth of a\ndentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow,\nrattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals.And from a squat\nden--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the\nwords \"Foreign Earth,\" and the guttering door-lantern hinted \"As You\nLike It\"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more\npoisonous than mere opium.\"Let's go faster,\" said the girl.\"Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy\nto-night.\"Skirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw\nagainst a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with\norange squares.Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered\nhere and there by twos and threes, and dispersed.Cackling argument came\nfrom the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of\nthe wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet.Both\npillars of the gate were plastered with them.Lighting match\nfrom match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows

straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging\nand crowding to a halt under the walls.Yellow faces gleamed faintly,\nbare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting.Among the\nvanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue.\"_Burra suar!_\" it\nraged; then hailed imperiously, \"_Ko hai?_\"\n\nWhere the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white\nwaved a helmet, crying,--\n\n\"On deck!\"I'm up here,\" called that young man.For reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his\nwhite legs like a dancing marionette.Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he\nsent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall.The squabbling\nretinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns\ndisappeared under the covered way.laughed Heywood, in amazement.All stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and\noutspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port.The\ntwo young men hurried to the stairs.Chinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and\nstill came straggling in at the gate.By the noise and clatter, it might\nhave been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder.Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles,\nboxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects.Among them, still brawling\nin bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders.At sight of\nHeywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant\ngrimaces.By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he\nseemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever.he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's\nhands and whirled him about.\"I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy!Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was\nbeyond question sober.Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an\nanxious glance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.but this is Hackh's

spend it all on\n_you_!\"Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a\nferocious kick.The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong!Look\nhere\"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: \"Chow de\nBruxelles, what?Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye?Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French.\"Something had happened,--evidently at\nCalcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he\ndropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the\neffect of heat or loneliness.But now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy,\nstaving open boxes right and left.A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a\nhissing froth of champagne.\"Plenty more,\" he cried, rejoicing.\"That shows ye how much _I_ care!Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood,\nbegan mysteriously to exult over him.'That cock won't fight,' says you.'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho!The eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief.\"No,\" he cried, with a start: \"you haven't?\"The captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a\nRoman stateliness.We'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet!First time in _my_ life: announce!\"Heywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject\nsilence.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the milk.\"Awfully glad, old chap,\" he at last contrived to say, and again\nchoked.The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular,\nbenign, and fatherly smile.\"I've known this boy a\nlong time,\" he explained to Rudolph.\"This matter's--We'll let you in,\npresently.Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my\nbanquet.With a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants'\nquarters.A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the\n\"learn-pidgin\" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the\ncourt; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud\nconfusion of orders and miscomprehension.Throughout the long, white\nroom, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft\nand tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown\nsisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such\nprofusion of viands, or of talk and laughter.The Saigon stores--after\ndaily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury.And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of\nthe table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin.His quick blue eyes\ndanced with the light of some ineffable joke.He seemed a conjurer,\ncreating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness.Stick a knife\ninto the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\"Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy.Chantel, at\nthe foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and\nthen caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion.It was\nbeside Rudolph that Mrs.Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all\neyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a\nsidelong shaft at her neighbor.Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now\nagain he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and\nentrancing.Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph\nof seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat.Never before had\nChantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her\npresence vibrated so near.Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face\nglowing red above the candles.Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of\nbounties, and looked expectantly toward their source.The captain\ncleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once,\nhung his head.\"Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all,\" he grumbled; and\nwheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been\ndefrauded: \"Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk,\nand now it's all gone!\"It was Miss Drake who came to his\nrescue.\"How do you manage all these nice\nthings?\"The captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the\nbright table, then returned to her, gratefully:--\n\n\"This ain't anything.Only a little--bloomin'--\"\n\n\"Impromptu,\" suggested Heywood.Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor.I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw,\npicking up these impromptus.But I came here all the way to break the\nnews proper, by word o' mouth.\"He faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,--\n\n\"I'm rich,\" he declared.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Pausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory.Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save\nmoney.But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the\nmoney's

sleep!And\nme without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live\nluxurious ever after!\"cried Nesbit, \"lucky beggar!\"And a volley of compliments went round the board.The captain\nplainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good\nwill, stood now at ease, chuckling.\"Most men,\" he began, when there came a lull, \"most men makes a will\nafter they're dead.That's a shore way o' doing things!Now _I_ want to\nsee the effects, living.So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper.To\nMiss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees.\"In the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed.she whispered, wavering between amusement and\ndistress.\"I can't accept it--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance.\"Don't spoil the\nhappiest evening of an old man's life.\"\"You're right,\" she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she\nthanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him\nduck and grin,--a proud little benefactor.\"That ain't all,\" he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger,\nlike a pistol, at her neighbor.\"Who poked fun at me, first and last?Who always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was?What did I come so many hundred miles\nfor?To say what I always said: half-shares.\"The light-blue eyes, keen\nwith sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an\nindescribable change.There's two rich men\nhere to-night.It was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb.\"Oh, I say,\" he stammered at last, \"it's not fair--\"\n\n\"Don't spoil the happiest evening--\" whispered the girl beside him.He eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the\nhead of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word\nto say.\"Can do, can do,\" said Captain Kneebone, curtly.\"I was afraid ye might\nnot want to come.\"Then followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache\nbristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening\nsentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white,\nwith such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the\nmelancholy \"boy\" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver\ncasket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul.As the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs.And presently, like a prisoner going to\nhis judge, Chantel slipped out of the room.He was not missed; for\nalready the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor\nwas it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full\nglass aloft.\"Here,\" he cried in triumph, \"here's to every nail in the hoof--\"\n\nThe glass crashed into splinters and froth.A flying stone struck the\nboom of the punkah, and thumped on the table.Through the open windows,\nfrom the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many\nvoices in the distance.As they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and\nclattered against the wall.Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an\nunaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a\nformidable silence.While the banqueters listened in the smoky room,\nthere came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and\nvery slack bass-drum.\"_Kau fai!_\" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as\nthough hurrying off toward the sound,--\"_kau fai!_\"\n\n\"The Black Dog,\" said Heywood, quietly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.Earlier than we\nfigured, Gilly.Gentlemen, we all know our\nposts.Rudie, go call\nChantel.If they ask about that noise, tell\n'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning.Anything.--We can easily\nhold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship.\"The captain wheeled, with an injured air.\"Told ye, plain, I was retired.Came\nthe last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now.Outside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse\ncalling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through\nthe darkness.CHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTHE GUNWALE\n\nRudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward\nrecalled as incredibly peaceful.Two of the women, at least, showed no\nfear.Earle, her chin cramped on her high\nbosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the\nRhine.Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him,\nsaying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs.Forrester had gone down to\nthe garden.In the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern.The compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that\nthe pair were not in the garden.He pointed", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "\"Makee finish, makee die now,\" he added calmly;\n\"too muchee, no can.\"Rudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the\nscalp.They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept\naway in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood\ntransfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of\nhelplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight,\ndarted down the covered way.The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in\na saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a\ngnome in the gallery of a mine.Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the\nheavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.Not all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the\nshapes which rushed behind him in his flight.Wheeling once, he saw two\nbroad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from\nHeywood's house, one from the club.He caught also a whirling impression\nof many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing\ndisorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout,\na single word, like \"_Sha, sha_!\"The flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious\ncriss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like\nfiery tadpoles through a net.He turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose\non hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin,\nrough cloth, warm and sopping.In a nausea of relief, he felt that this\nwas a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard.Rudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he\nand she had traversed at noon.Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped\nshort violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him,\nwrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic.He\nkicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free,\nwith a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible.Stranger\nstill, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he\nmissed the sharp music of her cicadas.Here stood her house; she had the\nbriefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way;\nby all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right\npath: why, then, had he not overtaken her?If she met that band which he\nhad just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning\nwildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her\nwindow.He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf,\nstumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and\nwent falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in\nhis life,--\"Bertha!Empty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered.At last, however,\nreaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door,\ntwo figures struggling.Just before he entered, she tore herself free\nand went unsteadily across the room.Chantel, white and abject, turned\nas in panic.Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his\nown.Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but\nhis staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution.\"Help\nme with her,\" he begged.The woman's out of\nher wits.\"He caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close\nfriends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction.She\nransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the\ncontents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese\nsilver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild\nheap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre\nearnings had been squandered.A Cingalese box dropped and burst open,\nscattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast.She trampled\nthem in her blind and furious search.\"Come,\" said Chantel, and snatched at her.Every minute--\"\n\nShe pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped\nagain among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for\nthe sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank,\ndilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd.\"Rudolph,\" she whimpered, \"help me.Without waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her\npitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands.Rudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better.\"We must humor her,\" whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler\namong the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and\nbrown, painted with men and buffaloes.On this he began to heap things\npell-mell.The woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph,\nhiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of\nher strength.\"Come, he'll bring them,\" she sobbed.\"Take me--leave\nhim, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and\nwe ran--\"\n\n\"What boat?\"\"I have one ready and stocked,\" he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at\nthe knot in the sarong corners.We'll drop down the\nriver, and try it along the coast.He rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle\nover his shoulder.Against the gay pattern, his\nhandsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight.\"Damn you,\nI've waited long enough for your whims.The woman's arms began to drag loosely,\nas if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she\nturned and bolted.Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till\nshe had caught Chantel at the gate.All three, silent, sped across\nfields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange\nglow from distant flames.The rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud.Behind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them,\nstill more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe.Through\nthe mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern\ngleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the\nthin, slant line that was his pole.called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as\nthe boatman answered.Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and\nleapt on board.Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman,\nwho lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion.He\nfelt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange,\nbreathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which\ntempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river.He lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung\nto his hands.snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the\nlantern.Obeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale.The slippery edge,\npolished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality\nin this dream, except the warmth of her hands.he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination.\"No, back to them,\" he answered stupidly.Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the\nboatman--\"Shove off, if they won't come!\"He seized the woman roughly\nand pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's\nhand again.\"Come, hurry,\" she whispered, tugging at him.She was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her.He must come\nwith her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames.She\nand life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an\nimpossible duty, and death.His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky\nlantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong.It meant\nnothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had\nconcentrated in a single vision, it meant everything.The \ncloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held\nall her treasure and her heart, the things of this world.She was beautiful--in all her fear and\ndisorder, still more beautiful.She went with life, departing into a\ndream.This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the\nsole reality, a shining line between life and death.\"Then I must die,\" he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that\nperilous boundary.He vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern\nand slash down at him with the lowdah's pole.The bamboo struck him,\nheavy but glancing, on the head.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.He staggered, lost his footing, and\nfell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken\nhim, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off\ninto the darkness.From somewhere in another direction came a sharp,\ncontinual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints\nin a fire.The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt\ngunpowder.But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were\ndry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears,\nand that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no\nlonger watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of\nflowing water.Without turning, he heard\na man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause\nand stoop close.When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes,\nhe saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie.Quite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in\nGerman.It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that\nfinally fretted him into listening.Rudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion.\"You cannot sit here all night,\" he said.Rudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could\nrebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid.He choked, swallowed,\nand presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river.said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of\nwomen.The rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found\nhimself afoot and awake.This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a\ncoolie and yet a brother from the fatherland.He and his nauseous alien\nbrandy had restored the future.The forsaken lover was first man up the bank.he\ncried, pointing to a new flare in the distance.The whole region was now\naglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a\ncontinuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a\nlean and exhausted laborer.\"I was with the men you fought, when you\nran.I followed to the house, and then here, to the river.I was glad\nyou did not jump on board.\"He glanced back, timidly, for approbation.\"I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay\nand help.\"He steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging\nin a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind\ntrees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker,\ncrept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames.When the\nquaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings\ndangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of\nsmoke.Once Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks.\"The nunnery is burning,\" he said hopelessly.His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened.\"No, they are still shooting,\" he answered, and limped onward, skirting\nthe uproar.At last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks,\nRudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came\nstumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles.Like a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered.\"Hide here, and wait,\" commanded Wutzler.And he\nflitted off through the smoke.Smuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting.Shapes of men ran\npast, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang\noverhead like a vibrating wire.Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling\nthrough the huddled pottery.The smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without\ncoughing, and could rest their smarting eyes.In the midst of tumult and\ncombustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool.Along its rim bristled a\nscrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud.After a time, something still blacker parted the weeds.In silhouette, a\nman's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained\nthere as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the\nact of spying.CHAPTER XVII\n\n\nLAMP OF HEAVEN\n\nThe white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty\nThieves.They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black\nhead lodged there without stirring.The watcher, whether he had seen\nthem or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he\nheld a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as\nthough he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing\nor waking, as the humor prompted.Wutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling\nheat.The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress.His\nlegs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to\nbreak, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs.He\nfelt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy\nbegin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss.This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly\nin his wits, gave him both impulse and plan.\"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\"And wriggling backward, inch\nby inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained\nthe further darkness.So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no\nmore than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge,\nagainst the rosy cloud.From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees,\nand silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit.Once, through\na rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind\nsome ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause\nor care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a\nglance behind.Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans\nor scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids.Passing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow.In spite of smoke,\nhe had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the\nman's legs.Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the\n<DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket\nbeside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.He\nseemed ready to spring up and fire.No time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with\na painful, giddy exactness.He would have counted to himself before\nleaping, but his throat was too dry.He flinched a little, then shot\nthrough the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the\nfellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat.Almost in the same\nmovement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his\nhead, as high as he could withdraw them.The body among the weeds lay\ncold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same\ntense attitude, which had nothing to do with life.Rudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal\ndiscourtesy.Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully\nup the bank.\"No, no,\" cried Rudolph, earnestly.By the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket,\nthe man at their feet was one of the musketeers.He had left the\nfiring-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in.Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his\njacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead\nman, began to untwist the scarlet turban.In the dim light his lean arms\nand frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape\nrobbing a sleeper.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the\nblood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod,\npowder-horn, and bag of bullets.--\"Now I am all safe,\" he chuckled.\"Now\nI can go anywhere, to-night.\"He shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were\nended.We try again; come.--Not too close behind me;\nand if I speak, run back.\"In this order they began once more to scout through the smoke.No one\nmet them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to\neach other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of\nsmoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the\nwrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of\ngongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that\nsputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red\ngold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters.Where and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as\nthey ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the\nheart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a\nstone's throw from his own gate.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.It was amazing to feel that safety lay\nso close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging\nin the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no\ndisturbance that evening.Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he\nwondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and\nwhy, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely\nto dig clay.He had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred\nhieroglyphic on his guide's jacket.Suddenly it vanished, and next\ninstant the muzzle of the gun jolted against his ribs.\"Run, quick,\" panted Wutzler, pushing him aside.\"To the left, into the\ngo-down.And with the words, he bounded\noff to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase.Rudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had\ndoubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered\nclose by him in the smoke.Before him gaped a black square, through\nwhich he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk.As he\nrose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had\nfallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his\nown, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery.With\nhigh hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness.Once, among the\nbales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away.With no\ntime to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps,\ngroping toward the other door.He had nearly reached it, when torchlight\nflared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and\nguttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse.He had barely time, in the\nreeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin\ncurtain of reeds to a new refuge.Into this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips,\numbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds.Lying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the\ngauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men\nwho shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the\nbales, to probe the darkness.Before\nit, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room,\nbrushing the splint partition like a snake.This, as Rudolph guessed,\nmight be the man whose hand he had stepped on.The stitches in the curtain became beads of light.A shadowy arm heaved\nup, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash.A sword had cut\nthe reeds from top to bottom.Through the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after\nboth, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat.Rudolph, half wrapped\nin his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their\nnarrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell\nresounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the\nflambeau, and the sword were snatched away.He lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril.They had caught\nthe crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights.Through the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an\nempty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling,\nand prodding him with their pikes.Some jeered, some snarled, others\ncalled him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or\nat least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down\nquestion after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an\ninquisition.At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his\nknees and faced them boldly.A haggard Christian, he was being fairly\ngiven his last chance to recant.they cried, in rage or entreaty.The kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct\nand simple.The same sword\nthat had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest.Rudolph,\nclenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all\nthese men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the\npast, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy.His round, honest,\noily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring\nlight.He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound\nhis queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers\nmoved surely and deftly.snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the\nfierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience.bawled the swordsman, beside himself.To the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder.And several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down.Rudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores\nto the nunnery.But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a\nsack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum.The\nsword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a\nfat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded\nflour and oil into a grimy batch of dough.\"Will you speak out and live,\" cried the swordsman, \"or will you die?\"Then, as though the option were\nnot in his power,--\n\n\"Die,\" he answered.The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless\ngray turban of dough.Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of\nlighting it.The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single\ncry, clear above all the others.He was calling--as even Rudolph\nknew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the\nWest, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant.Rudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and\nfall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the\ngeneral din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots.Splinters flew\nfrom the attap walls.A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun\nhalf round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken\nwrestlers.The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and\ndiving over bales.On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed\nthat its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of\nhumility.Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the\ncomplete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or\ndomestic, new or old.With a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found\nthe side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane.He\nknew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed,\nand step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when\nsomething from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the\nground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended.His own\nfriends: they might miss him once, but not twice.Instead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever\nknown,--a keen, high voice, scolding.It was Heywood, somewhere on the\nroof of the pony-shed.He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and\ncheerful.You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take\nyour gun away.Nesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection.\"Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down's afire.\"The other voice moved away, with\na parting rebuke.\"No more of that, sniping and squandering.Rudolph lifted his head from the dust.answered his captain on the wall, blithely.\"Steady on, we'll\nget you.\"Of all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable.Then a bight of\nrope fell across Rudolph's back.He seized it, hauled taut, and planting\nhis feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row\nof sand-bags.His invisible friend clapped him on the\nshoulder.Compradore has a gun for you, in the court.Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner.Danger point there:\nwe need a good man, so hurry.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.Rudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound\nwith his head in a whirl.Yet through all the scudding darkness and\nconfusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star.On this night of\nalarms, he had turned the great corner in his life.Like the pale\nstranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course.He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught\nfrom any earthly cup.Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the\nnortheast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile\nadmiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger.CHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nSIEGE\n\nHe never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a\nminute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar.Bullets spattered sharply\nalong the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an\nindescribable whistling and jingling.The angle was like the prow of a\nship cutting forward into a gale.Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the\nshort bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such\nhaste, so long ago, that afternoon.As he stood up, in the full glow\nfrom the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw\nhim head first on the sand-bags.\"Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below,\nye gallivanting--Oh!A\nstubby finger pointed in the obscurity.and don't ye fire till\nI say so!\"Thus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran\nthe muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come\nout of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.Nothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling\ncloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder.It\nwas strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to\nmoment.No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub.He himself lay\nthere unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the\nplatform.At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal\nfor the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack\nbass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off.Yet\neven then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,\nbut only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling.\"Copper cash,\" declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull.By the sound,\nhe was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level\nof the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself\ninordinately.Firing money at us--like you, Captain.Some unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters.The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.Here, in the thick of the fight, was a\nlight-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news\nfrom chaos.\"Look out for arrows,\" continued the speaker, as he crawled to a\nloophole between Rudolph's and the captain's.Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.They can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though.\"And again he\nadded, cheerfully, \"So far, at least.\"The little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,\nlistening through the noise.The Black Dog barked again, and sent a\nshower of money clinking along the wall.\"It is terrible,\" answered Rudolph, honestly.Wait till their\nammunition comes; then you'll see fun.\"I say, Kneebone, what's your idea?Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?\"The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and\nappeared to sniff the smoke judicially.\"They get a chance at us, more like!\"\"My opinion, the\nblighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin'\ndelusion o' grandeur, that's what.Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night,\nonce--maybe twice.We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down\nto starve us, right and proper.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\"Wish a man\ncould smoke up here.\"Heywood laughed, and turned his head:--\n\n\"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?\"Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of\nthing.However,\" he went on cheerfully, \"we shall before long\"--He broke\noff with a start.\"Gone,\" said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late\nadventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare\nto suggest the magnitude of his decision.\"They went,\" he began, \"in\na boat--\"\n\nHe was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice\nof keen satisfaction, \"Here they come!Through a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept\na ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet\nnightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling.One of\nthe foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his\nown length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between\nthe sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled\nsidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking\narms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster.Among and\nabove them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of\nscaling-ladders and notched bamboos.Two naked men, swinging between\nthem a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on\ninto the dark below the wall.\"Look out for the pung-dong!\"His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below.Rudolph,\nfumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump\nhis forehead, saw turban and media", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,\nbut the man vanished like a shade.\"Very neat,\" growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great\nshove, managed to fling down the ladder.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.While he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped\nthe platform.The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal\nsputtering at one end, a burning fuse.Heywood snatched at it and\nmissed.Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his\nfeet, swung it aloft.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football.Firelight showed the bristling moustache of\nKempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with\nrings of leather or metal.He threw it out with his utmost force,\nstaggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his\ntall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no\nsooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for\nanother of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and\nthe night.By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.Before, the angle was alive with swarming heads.As he fell, it was\nempty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a\nsound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot\nchemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron\nfaces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire\nand powder-horns bursting at their sides.Dim figures scampered off, up\nthe rising ground.\"Thundering good lesson,--Here, count\nnoses.Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain?but\nlook sharp, while I go inspect.\"\"Come down,\nwon't you, and help me with--you know.\"At the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in\nwhat might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,\n\"Where is she?It was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on\nthe ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had\nchosen.The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of\nthem.It was like telling the news of\nan absent ghost to another present.\"This town was never a place,\" said Gilly, with all his former\nsteadiness,--\"never a place to bring a woman.All three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the\nshouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll.All three, as it\nseemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile.\"That's all I wanted to know,\" said the older man, slowly.You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here?For some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood\nspoke:--\n\n\"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?\"\"Oh, yes,\" replied Forrester, rousing slightly.Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle.Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return\nthem.--Anything else?\"\"No,\" answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into\nthe darkness.\"Except if we come to a pinch,\nand need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.I could do better, now, than--than you younger men.Oh, and Hackh;\nyour efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel\nimmensely grateful.\"He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about\nsuch gratitude.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.\"Now, then,\" called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their\nfeet.Trust old Gilly to take it\nlike a man.And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome\ntheorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would\noffend no more by speaking.When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in\nturn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,\nlike an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow.To ears long\ndeafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never\nheard before.Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from\ntop to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by\nsome unholy constraint.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from\nsmouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale\ndisk of the moon dissolved in light.The convex field stood bare, except\nfor a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a\njagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog\nthrust his round muzzle.In a truce of empty silence, the defenders\nslept by turns among the sand-bags.The day came, and dragged by without incident.The sun blazed in the\ncompound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon.At\nthe water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn\nChristians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building\na rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that\nnow lay scattered along the path.One of these a workman suddenly caught\nat, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran\na thin roll of Chinese paper.Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,\nfreed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters.His keen\nold eyes ran down the columns.His face, always cloudy now, grew darker\nwith perplexity.He sat\ndown on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee.\"But the\ncharacters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail.\"He beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and\nmeaningless symbols.The last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose \"O.For all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking\nat top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb.\"They are all\nalike, and yet\"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and\ntugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.he said doubtfully; and at last, \"Yes.\"For some time he read to\nhimself, nodding.\"Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?\"\"Take,\" the padre ordered, \"this one; left half?\"\"The right half--might be\n'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense.\"Subtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made\nthe crooked straight.Here's the\nsense of his message, I take it.\"And he read off, slowly:--\n\n\"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted\nat her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come\nquickly, day or night.--O.W.\"\"That won't help,\" he said curtly.With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured\nout on the highest slab of the landing-steps.Across the river, to be\nsure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the\nnorth--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny\nbasket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a\ngreen rag.Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,\nyet seeming to watch.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to\nwhere, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the\nmarsh.On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up\nlike a thin black toadstool.He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,\nsummoning help from further inland.Other hats presently came bobbing\ntoward him, low down among the marsh.Puffs of white spurted out from\nthe mud.And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle\nanswered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the\nmuskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the\nriver-stairs.\"Covered, you see,\" said Heywood, replacing the bar.Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood\nready here.\"The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a\nsignal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the\nnoise of last night broke out afresh.The sun lowered through a brown,\nburnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with\nsudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the\ntorrid earth and the insensate turmoil.So, without change but from\npause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in\nthe siege.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt\narrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.The\npaper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and\nheel-prints: \"Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely.\"And still\nnothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate\nwith four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close\nunder the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned\nsafely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,\nand a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the\ndefenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under\nwhat in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was\nKempner's grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and\nmade him stoop.\"I was coming,\" he said, \"to find you.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.The first night, I saw coolies\nworking in the clay-pit.\"They're keeping such a racket outside,\" he muttered; and then, half to\nhimself: \"It certainly is.Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner\nwere--waking up.\"The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.CHAPTER XIX\n\n\nBROTHER MOLES\n\nThis new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph\ninto a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought\nindignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any\nmoment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his\nfriend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary.\"Now we know what\nthe beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a\nBuddha.\"That's why they've all been lying doggo,\" he continued.\"And then their\nbad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,\nwhether they pot us or not.They'd rather make one clean sweep, and\n'blow us at the moon.'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,\nthey're not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last\ngiving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this\ndiluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark\nhospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials.\"If it weren't for that,\" he said quietly, \"I shouldn't much care.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.Except for the women, this would really be great larks.\"Then, as a\nshadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: \"Ah\nPat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!\"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other\nshadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust.\"Those noises have stopped, down there,\" he said to Rudolph; and rising,\ngave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the\nsappers' tunnel, and report at once: \"Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's\ntake a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast\nfaint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with\nwater from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood\nstooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely\ninto a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content.\"Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the\ncompradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken\nshadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the\nstars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his\nleathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still\ndrenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,\nbroken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a\nbullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers.\"Queer,\" mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch.\"The beggar puts\none shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's\nthinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they're all\"--He put back his cigar, mumbling.\"Handful of\npoor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all\nthe rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same\nold way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams\nthey had in Marco Polo's day.\"The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he\nmight have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This\nbrief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there\nand wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.Some quiet\ninfluence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had\nfelt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in\nclearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any\nlater harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were\nbrightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,\na single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving\nquietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady\nfingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent\nMedea, intent on some white magic.\"Aren't you coming,\" called Heywood, \"to sit with us awhile?\"\"Can't, thanks,\" she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled\nback at him as from a crypt, and said:--\n\n\"Have _you_ been hurt?\"\"I've no time,\" she laughed, \"for lazy able-bodied persons.\"And she was\ngone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another\nfigure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost\nin their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with\ndownward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the\ncourtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying\nexhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all\nthe width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to\nwhich Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith.\"Earle,\" said the young man, gently, \"there ought to be no\nneed.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and\nhalting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised\nmound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner's grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:\nthey had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were\ngone out to eat their chow.\"We'll see, anyway,\" said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed\nover the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long\nmoment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as\nRudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint\nmomentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and\nshoulders burrowed up again.\"Big enough hole down there,\" he reported, swinging clear, and sitting\nwith his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed\nalready, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.I struck a match,\nand nearly blew myself to Casabianca.\"\"It\ngives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather\nfoolhardy?<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give\nold Gilly Forrester his chance.\"said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!\"Give me half a\nmoment start, so that you won't jump on my head.\"And he went wriggling\ndown into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,\nenveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,\ncrawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,\nfor two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,\nthrough earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth\nfloor by many hands and bare knees.In\nthe small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he\nbumped Heywood's elbow.\"Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say.\"The speaker\npatted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel\nabout.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it\nwas.Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it\nto where a powder-bag lay.\"Now, then, carry on,\" he commanded;

and this time the\nleader talked without lowering his voice.\"That chap,\" he declared, \"was fairly chattering with fright.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.Coolie, it\nseems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside\neating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at\nfirst easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously\nup a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came\nhard in the stifled burrow.\"Far enough,\" said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new\nspirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the\nearth, to emulate his friend.\"But let us reconnoitre,\" he objected.\"It will bring us to the clay-pit\nwhere I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look.\"By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old\nGilly down here, you know.\"They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait\nlittle gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Resolve now to note down here\n    whatever transpires of importance to me.Am again at McGrawville\n    after about one year\u2019s absence.To-day\n    have entered the junior year in New York Central College.This day\n    may be one of the most important in my life.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.11th, 1854._ To-day have commenced my Senior year, at\n    New York Central College.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.My studies are: Calculus;

and I long to see it again, for its foundation rests on\n    the basis of Eternal Truth\u2014and my heart strings are twined around\n    its every pillar.To suit her actions to her words, she became a woman suffragist and\nadopted the \u201cbloomer\u201d costume.It was worth something in those early\ndays to receive, as she did, letters from Susan B. Anthony and Horace\nGreeley.Of that hard-hitting Unitarian minister and noble poet, John\nPierpont, she wrote, at the time of her graduation:\n\n    The Rev.He preached in the chapel Sunday\n    forenoon.He is\n    over seventy years old, but is as straight as can be, and his face\n    is as fresh as a young man\u2019s.Little did she dream that this ardent patriot would one day march into\nWashington at the head of a New Hampshire regiment, and break bread at\nher table.Nor could she foresee that her college friends Oscar Fox and\nA. J. Warner would win laurels on the battlefields of Bull Run and\nAntietam, vindicating their faith with their blood.Both giants in\nstature, Captain Fox carried a minie-ball in his breast for forty years,\nand Colonel Warner, shot through the hip, was saved by a miracle of\nsurgery.Of her classmates\u2014there were only four, all men, who graduated\nwith her\u2014she wrote:\n\n    I think I have three as noble classmates as you will find in any\n    College, they are Living Men.It is amusing to turn from college friends to college studies\u2014such a\ncontrast between the living men and their academic labors.For example,\nAngeline Stickney took the degree of A.B.in July, 1855, having entered\ncollege, with a modest preparation, in April, 1852, and having been\nabsent about a year, from November, 1852 to September, 1853, when she\nentered the Junior Class.It is recorded that she studied Virgil the\nsummer of 1852; the fall of 1853, German, Greek, and mathematical\nastronomy; the next term, Greek and German; and the next term, ending\nJuly 12, 1854, Greek, natural philosophy, German and surveying.She\nbegan her senior year with calculus, philosophy, natural and mental, and\nAnthon\u2019s Homer, and during that year studied also Wayland\u2019s Political\nEconomy and Butler\u2019s Analogy.She is also credited with work done in\ndeclamation and composition, and \u201ctwo orations performed.\u201d Her marks, as\nfar as my incomplete records show, were all perfect, save that for one\nterm she was marked 98 per cent in Greek.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.Upon the credit slip for the\nlast term her \u201cstanding\u201d is marked \u201c1\u201d; and her \u201cconduct\u201d whenever\nmarked is always 100.However, be it observed that Angeline Stickney not only completed the\ncollege curriculum at McGrawville, but also taught classes in\nmathematics.In fact, her future husband was one of her pupils, and has\nborne witness that she was a \u201cgood, careful teacher.\u201d\n\nIf McGrawville was not distinguished for high thinking, it could at\nleast lay claim to plain living.Let us inquire into the ways and means\nof the Stickney sisters.I have already stated that board and lodging\ncost the two together only one dollar a week.They wrote home to their\nmother, soon after their arrival:\n\n    We are situated in the best place possible for studying domestic\n    economy.We bought a quart of milk, a pound of crackers, and a sack\n    of flour this morning.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Tuition for a term of three months was only five dollars; and poor\nstudents were encouraged to come and earn their way through college.Ruth returned home after one term, and Angeline worked for her board at\na Professor Kingley\u2019s, getting victuals, washing dishes, and sweeping.Even so, after two terms her slender means were exhausted, and she went\nhome to teach for a year.Returning to college in September, 1853, she\ncompleted the course in two years, breaking down at last for lack of\nrecreation and nourishment.Ruth returned to McGrawville in 1854, and\nwrote home: \u201cfound Angie well and in good spirits.We are going to board\nourselves at Mr.Smith\u2019s.\u201d And Angeline herself wrote: \u201cMy health has\nbeen quite good ever since I came here.It agrees with me to study....\nWe have a very pleasant boarding place, just far enough from the college\nfor a pleasant walk.\u201d\n\nAngeline was not selfishly ambitious, but desired her sister\u2019s education\nas well as her own.Before the bar of her Puritanical conscience she may\nhave justified her own ambition by being ambitious for her sister.In\nthe fall of 1853 she wrote to Ruth:\n\n    I hope you will make up your mind to come out here to school next\n    spring.You can go through college as well as I. As soon as I get\n    through I will help you.You can go through the scientific course, I\n    should think, in two years after next spring term if you should come\n    that term.Then we would be here a year together, and you would get\n    a pretty good start.There seems to be a way opening for me to get\n    into good business as soon as I get through college.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.And again, in January, 1854:\n\n    Ruth, I believe I am more anxious to have you come to school than I\n    ever was before.I see how much it will increase your influence, and\n    suffering humanity calls for noble spirits to come to its aid.And I\n    would like to have you fitted for an efficient laborer.I know you\n    have intellect, and I would have it disciplined and polished.Come\n    and join the little band of reformers here, will you not?Sometimes I get very lonely here, and I never should,\n    if you were only here.Tell me in your next letter that you will\n    come.I will help you all I can in every thing.But Ruth lacked her sister\u2019s indomitable will.She loved her, and wished\nto be with her, whether at home or at college.Indeed, in a letter to\nAngeline she said she would tease very hard to have her come home, did\nshe not realize how her heart was set upon getting an education.Ruth\ndid return to McGrawville in 1854, but remained only two months, on\naccount of poor health.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.The student fare did not agree with the vigorous\nRuth, apparently; and she now gave up further thought of college, and\ngenerously sought to help her sister what she could financially.Though a dime at McGrawville was equivalent to a dollar elsewhere,\nAngeline was much cramped for money, and to complete her course was\nobliged finally to borrow fifty dollars from her cousin Joseph Downs,\ngiving her note payable in one year.When her breakdown came, six weeks\nbefore graduation, Ruth, like a good angel, came and took her home.It\nwas a case of sheer exhaustion, aggravated by a tremendous dose of\nmedicine administered by a well-meaning friend.Though she returned to\nMcGrawville and graduated with her class, even producing a sorry sort of\npoem for the commencement exercises, it was two or three years before\nshe regained her health.Such was a common experience among ambitious\nAmerican students fifty years ago, before the advent of athletics and\ngymnasiums.In closing this chapter, I will quote a character sketch written by one\nof Angeline\u2019s classmates:\n\n    _Slate Pencil Sketches\u2014No.L. A. C\u2014and C. A. Stickney._ Miss C\u2014\n    is Professor of Rhetoric, and Miss Stickney is a member of the\n    Senior Class, in N.Y.A description of their\n    personal appearance may not be allowable; besides it could not be\n    attracting, since the element of Beauty would not enter largely into\n    the sketch.Both are fortunately removed to a safe distance from\n    Beauty of the Venus type; though the truth may not be quite\n    apparent, because the adornments of mind by the force of association\n    have thrown around them the Quakerish veil of _good looks_ (to use\n    moderate terms), which answers every desirable end of the most\n    charming attractions, besides effectually saving both from the folly\n    of Pride.Nevertheless, the writer of this sketch can have no\n    earthly object in concealing his appreciation of the high brow, and\n    Nymphean make of the one, and the lustrous eye of the other.And these personal characteristics are happily suggestive of the\n    marked mental traits of each.The intellect of the one is subtle,\n    apprehensive, flexible, docile; with an imagination gay and\n    discursive, loving the sentimental for the beauty of it.The\n    intellect of the other is strong and comprehensive, with an\n    imagination ardent and glowing, inclined perhaps to the sentimental,\n    but ashamed to own it.However, let these features pass for the moment until we have\n    brought under review some other more obvious traits of character.Miss C\u2014, or if you will allow me to throw aside the _Miss_ and the\n    Surname, and say Lydia and Angeline, who will complain?Lydia, then,\n    is possessed of a good share of self-reliance\u2014self-reliance arising\n    from a rational self-esteem.Whether Angeline possesses the power of\n    a proper self-appreciation or not, she is certainly wanting in", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "She may manifest much confidence on occasions, but it\n    is all acquired confidence; while with Lydia, it is all natural.Lydia goes forward in\n    public exercises as though the public were her normal sphere.On the\n    other hand Angeline frequently appears embarrassed, though her\n    unusual powers of _will_ never suffer her to make a failure.Lydia\n    is ambitious; though she pursues the object of her ambition in a\n    quiet, complacent way, and appropriates it when secured _all as a\n    matter of course_.It is possible with Angeline to be ambitious, but\n    _not at once_\u2014and _never_ so naturally.Her ambition is born of\n    many-yeared wishes\u2014wishes grounded mainly in the moral nature,\n    cherished by friendly encouragements, ripening at last into a\n    settled purpose.Thus springs up her ambition, unconfessed\u2014its\n    triumph doubted even in the hour of fruition.When I speak of the ambition of these two, I hope to be understood\n    as meaning ambition with its true feminine modifications.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.And this\n    is the contrast:\u2014The ambition of the one is a necessity of her\n    nature, the ripening of every hour\u2019s aspiration; while the ambition\n    of the other is but the fortunate afterthought of an unsophisticated\n    wish.Both the subjects of this sketch excel in prose and poetic\n    composition.Each may rightfully lay claim to the name of poetess.But Lydia is much the better known in this respect.Perhaps the\n    constitution of her mind inclines her more strongly to employ the\n    ornaments of verse, in expressing her thoughts; and perhaps the mind\n    of Angeline has been too much engrossed in scientific studies to\n    allow of extensive English reading, or of patient efforts at\n    elaboration.Hence her productions reveal the _poet_ only; while\n    those of her friend show both the _poet_ and the _artist_.In truth,\n    Lydia is by nature far more artificial than Angeline\u2014perhaps I\n    should have said _artistic_.Every line of her composition reveals\n    an effort at ornament.The productions of Angeline impress you with\n    the idea that the author must have had no foreknowledge of what kind\n    of style would come of her efforts.Her style is\n    manifestly Calvinistic; in all its features it bears the most\n    palpable marks of election and predestination.Its every trait has\n    been subjected to the ordeal of choice, either direct or indirect.You know it to be a something _developed_ by constant retouches and\n    successive admixtures.Not that it is an _imitation_ of admired\n    authors; yet it is plainly the result of an imitative nature\u2014a\n    something, not borrowed, but _caught_ from a world of beauties, just\n    as sometimes a well-defined thought is the sequence of a thousand\n    flitting conceptions.Her style is the offspring, the issue of the\n    love she has cherished for the beautiful in other minds yet bearing\n    the image of her own.Not so with Angeline, for there is no imitativeness in her nature.Her style can arise from no such commerce of mind, but the Spirit of\n    the Beautiful overshadowing her, it springs up in its singleness,\n    and its genealogy cannot be traced.But this contrast of style is not the only contrast resulting from\n    this difference in imitation and in love of ornament.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.It runs\n    through all the phases of their character.Especially is it seen in\n    manner, dress and speech; but in speech more particularly.When\n    Lydia is in a passage of unimpassioned eloquence, her speech reminds\n    you that the tongue is Woman\u2019s plaything; while Angeline plies the\n    same organ with as utilitarian an air as a housewife\u2019s churn-dasher.But pardon this exaggeration: something may be pardoned to the\n    spirit of liberty; and the writer is aware that he is using great\n    liberties.To return: Lydia has a fine sense of the ludicrous.Her name is\n    charmingly appropriate, signifying in the original playful or\n    sportive.Her laughter wells up from within, and gurgles out from\n    the corners of her mouth.Angeline is but moderately mirthful, and\n    her laughter seems to come from somewhere else, and shines on the\n    outside of her face like pale moonlight.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.In Lydia\u2019s mirthfulness\n    there is a strong tincture of the sarcastic and the droll.Angeline\n    at the most is only humorous.When a funny thing happens, Lydia\n    laughs _at_ it\u2014Angeline laughs _about_ it.Lydia might be giggling\n    all day alone, just at her own thoughts.Angeline I do not believe\n    ever laughs except some one is by to talk the fun.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.And in sleep,\n    while Lydia was dreaming of jokes and quips, Angeline might be\n    fighting the old Nightmare.After all, do not understand me as saying that the Professor C\u2014\u2013 is\n    always giggling like a school-girl; or that the Senior Stickney is\n    apt to be melancholy and down in the mouth.I have tried to describe\n    their feelings relatively.Lydia has a strong, active imagination, marked by a vivid\n    playfulness of fancy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.Her thoughts flow on, earnest, yet sparkling\n    and flashing like a raven-black eye.Angeline has an imagination\n    that glows rather than sparkles.It never scintillates, but\n    gradually its brightness comes on with increasing radiance.If the\n    thoughts of Lydia flit like fire flies, the thoughts of Angeline\n    unfold like the blowing rose.If the fancy of one glides like a\n    sylph or tiptoes like a school-girl, the imagination of the other\n    bears on with more stateliness, though with less grace.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.Lydia\u2019s\n    imagination takes its flight up among the stars, it turns, dives,\n    wheels, peers, scrutinizes, wonders and grows serious and then\n    fearful.But the imagination of the other takes its stand like a\n    maiden by the side of a clear pool, and gazes down into the depths\n    of Beauty.Their different gifts befit their different natures.While one\n    revels in delight, the other is lost in rapture; while one is\n    trembling with awe, the other is quietly gazing into the mysterious.While one is worshipping the beautiful, the other lays hold on the\n    sublime.Beauty is the ideal of the one; sublimity is the normal\n    sphere of the other.Both seek unto the spiritual, but through\n    different paths.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.When the qualities of each are displayed, the one\n    is a chaste star shining aloft in the bright skies; the other is a\n    sunset glow, rich as gold, but garish all around with gray clouds.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                          COLLEGE PRODUCTIONS.It is next in order to examine some of the literary\nproductions of Angeline Stickney while at college.Like the literary\nremains of Oliver Cromwell, they are of a strange and uncertain\ncharacter.It would be easy to make fun of them; and yet sincerity is\nperhaps their chief characteristic.They are Puritanism brought down to\nthe nineteenth century\u2014solemn, absurd, almost maudlin in their religious\nsentimentality, and yet deeply earnest and at times noble.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.The\nmanuscripts upon which these literary productions are recorded are worn,\ncreased, stained, torn and covered with writing\u2014bearing witness to the\nrigid economy practiced by the writer.The penmanship is careful, every\nletter clearly formed, for Angeline Stickney was not one of those vain\npersons who imagine that slovenly handwriting is a mark of genius.First, I will quote a passage illustrating the intense loyalty of our\nyoung Puritan to her Alma Mater:\n\n    About a year since, I bade adieu to my fellow students here, and\n    took the farewell look of the loved Alma Mater, Central College.It\n    was a \u201clonging, lingering look\u201d for I thought it had never seemed so\n    beautiful as on that morning.The rising sun cast a flood of golden\n    light upon it making it glow as if it were itself a sun; and so I\n    thought indeed it was, a sun of truth just risen, a sun that would\n    send forth such floods of light that Error would flee before it and\n    never dare to come again with its dark wing to brood over our\n    land.\u2014And every time I have thought of Central College during my\n    absence, it has come up before me with that halo of golden light\n    upon it, and then I have had such longings to come and enjoy that\n    light; and now I have come, and I am glad that I am here.Yes, I am\n    glad, though I have left my home with all its clear scenes and\n    loving hearts; I am glad though I know the world will frown upon me,\n    because I am a student of this unpopular institution, and I expect\n    to get the name that I have heard applied to all who come here,\n    \u201cfanatic.\u201d I am glad that I am here because I love this institution.I love the spirit that welcomes all to its halls, those of every\n    tongue, and of every hue, which admits of \u201cno rights exclusive,\u201d\n    which holds out the cup of knowledge in it\u2019s crystal brightness for\n    all to quaff; and if this is fanaticism, I will glory in the name\n    \u201cfanatic.\u201d Let me live, let me die a fanatic.I will not seal up in\n    my heart the fountain of love that gushes forth for all the human\n    race.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.And I am glad I am here because there are none here to say,\n    \u201cthus far thou mayst ascend the hill of Science and no farther,\u201d\n    when I have just learned how sweet are the fruits of knowledge, and\n    when I can see them hanging in such rich clusters, far up the\n    heights, looking so bright and golden, as if they were inviting me\n    to partake.And all the while I can see my brother gathering those\n    golden fruits, and I mark how his eye brightens, as he speeds up the\n    shining track, laden with thousands of sparkling gems and crowned\n    with bright garlands of laurel, gathered from beside his path.No,\n    there are none here to whisper, \u201c_that_ is beyond _thy_ sphere, thou\n    couldst never scale those dizzy heights\u201d; but, on the contrary, here\n    are kind voices cheering me onward.I have long yearned for such\n    words of cheer, and now to hear them makes my way bright and my\n    heart strong.Next, behold what a fire-eater this modest young woman could be:\n\n    Yes, let the union be dissolved rather than bow in submission to\n    such a detestable, abominable, infamous law, a law in derogation of\n    the genius of our free institutions, an exhibition of tyranny and\n    injustice which might well put to the blush a nation of barbarians.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.Then is a union of robbers, of\n    pirates, a glorious union; for to rob a man of liberty is the worst\n    of robberies, the foulest of piracies.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Let us just glance at one of\n    the terrible features of this law, at the provision which allows to\n    the commissioner who is appointed to decide upon the future freedom\n    or slavery of the fugitive the sum of ten dollars if he decides in\n    favor of his slavery and but five if in favor of freedom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Legislative bribery striking of hands with the basest iniquity!...What are the evils that can accrue to the nation from a dissolution\n    of the union?It would\n    be but a separation from a parasite that is sapping from us our very\n    life.Let them stand alone and be\n    abhorred of all nations, that they may the sooner learn the lesson\n    of repentance!Such a dissolution would\n    strike the death blow to slavery.23, 15 & 16:\n    \u201cThou shalt not deliver over unto his master the servant which is\n    escaped from his master unto thee.He shall dwell with thee, even\n    among you, in that place which he shall choose.\u201d\u2014The law of God\n    against the fugitive slave law.The passages quoted are more fraught with feeling than any of the rest\nof the prose selections before me; and I will pass over most of them,\nbarely mentioning the subjects.There is a silly and sentimental piece\nentitled \u201cMrs.Emily Judson,\u201d in which the demise of the third wife of\nthe famous missionary is noticed.There is a short piece of\nargumentation in behalf of a regulation requiring attendance on public\nworship.There is a sophomoric bit of prose entitled \u201cThe Spirit Of\nSong,\u201d wherein we have a glimpse of the Garden of Eden and its happy\nlovers.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.There is a piece, without title, in honor of earth\u2019s angels, the\nnoble souls who give their lives to perishing and oppressed humanity.The following, in regard to modern poetry, is both true and well\nexpressed:\n\n    The superficial unchristian doctrine of our day is that poetry\n    flourishes most in an uncultivated soil, that the imagination shapes\n    her choicest images from the mists of a superstitious age.The\n    materials of poetry must ever remain the same and inexhaustible.Poetry has its origin in the nature of man, in the deep and\n    mysterious recesses of the human soul.It is not the external only,\n    but the inner life, the mysterious workmanship of man\u2019s heart and\n    the slumbering elements of passion which furnish the materials of\n    poetry.Finally, because of the subject, I quote the following:\n\n    The study of Astronomy gives us the most exalted views of the\n    Creator, and it exalts ourselves also, and binds our souls more\n    closely to the soul of the Infinite.It\n    teaches that the earth, though it seem so immovable, not only turns\n    on its axis, but goes sweeping round a great circle whose miles are\n    counted by millions; and though it seem so huge, with its wide\n    continents and vast oceans, it is but a speck when compared with the\n    manifold works of God.It teaches the form, weight, and motion of\n    the earth, and then it bids us go up and weigh and measure the sun\n    and planets and solve the mighty problems of their motion.It bids us press upward beyond the boundary of our\n    little system of worlds up to where the star-gems lie glowing in the\n    great deep of heaven.And then we find that these glittering specks\n    are vast suns, pressing on in their shining courses, sun around sun,\n    and system around system, in harmony, in beauty, in grandeur; and as\n    we view them spread out in their splendour and infinity, we pause to\n    think of Him who has formed them, and we feel his greatness and\n    excellence and majesty, and in contemplating Him, the most sublime\n    object in the universe, our own souls are expanded, and filled with\n    awe and reverence and love.And they long to break through their\n    earthly prison-house that they may go forth on their great mission\n    of knowledge, and rising higher and higher into the heavens they may\n    at last bow in adoration and worship before the throne of the\n    Eternal.To complete this study of Angeline Stickney\u2019s college writings, it is\nnecessary, though somewhat painful, to quote specimens of her poetry.For example:\n\n           There was worship in Heaven.An angel choir,\n           On many and many a golden lyre\n           Was hymning its praise.To the strain sublime\n           With the beat of their wings that choir kept time.One is tempted to ask maliciously, \u201cMoulting time?\u201d\n\nHere is another specimen, of which no manuscript copy is in existence,\nits preservation being due to the loving admiration of Ruth Stickney,\nwho memorized it:\n\n            Clouds, ye are beautiful!I love to gaze\n            Upon your gorgeous hues and varying forms,\n            When lighted with the sun of noon-day\u2019s blaze,\n            Or when ye are darkened with the blackest storms.Next, consider this rather morbidly religious effusion in blank verse:\n\n       I see thee reaching forth thy hand to take\n       The laurel wreath that Fame has twined and now\n       Offers to thee, if thou wilt but bow down\n       And worship at her feet and bring to her\n       The goodly offerings of thy soul.I see\n       Thee grasp the iron pen to write thy name\n       In everlasting characters upon\n       The gate of Fame\u2019s fair dome.Ah, take not yet the wreath of Fame, lest thou\n       Be satisfied with its false glittering\n       And fail to win a brighter, fairer crown,\u2014\n       Such crown as Fame\u2019s skilled fingers ne\u2019er have learned\n       To fashion, e\u2019en a crown of Life.And bring\n       Thy offerings, the first, the best, and place\n       Them on God\u2019s altar, and for incense sweet\n       Give Him the freshness of thy youth.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.And thus\n       Thou mayest gain a never fading crown.And wait not now to trace thy name upon\n       The catalogue of Fame\u2019s immortal ones, but haste thee first\n       To have it writ in Heaven in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life.Pardon this seeming betrayal of a rustic poetess.For it seems like\nbetrayal to quote such lines, when she produced much better ones.For\nexample, the following verses are, to my mind, true and rather good\npoetry:\n\n                   I have not known thee long friend,\n                   Yet I remember thee;\n                   Aye deep within my heart of hearts\n                   Shall live thy memory.And I would ask of thee friend\n                   That thou wouldst think of me.There are ten thousand cords\n          Which bind my soul to life, ten thousand sweets\n          Mixed with the bitter of existence\u2019 cup\n          Which make me love to quaff its mingled wine.There are sweet looks and tones through all the earth\n          That win my heart.Love-looks are in the lily\u2019s bell\n          And violet\u2019s eye, and love-tones on the winds\n          And waters.There are forms of grace which all\n          The while are gliding by, enrapturing\n          My vision.O, I can not guess how one\n          Can weary of the earth, when ev\u2019ry year\n          To me it seems more and more beautiful;\n          When each succeeding spring the flowers wear\n          A fairer hue, and ev\u2019ry autumn on\n          The forest top are richer tints.When each\n          Succeeding day the sunlight brighter seems,\n          And ev\u2019ry night a fairer beauty shines\n          From all the stars....\n\nLikewise, this rather melancholy effusion, entitled \u201cWaiting\u201d:\n\n                Love, sweet Love, I\u2019m waiting for thee,\n                And my heart is wildly beating\n                At the joyous thought of meeting\n                With its kindred heart so dear.Love, _now_ I am waiting for thee.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden._Soon_ I shall not wait thee more,\n                Neither by the open casement,\n                Nor beside the open door\n                Shall I sit and wait thee more.Love, I shall not wait long for thee,\n                Not upon Time\u2019s barren shore,\n                For I see my cheek is paling,\n                And I feel my strength is failing.Love, I shall not wait here for thee.When I ope the golden door\n                I will ask to wait there for thee,\n                Close beside Heaven\u2019s open door.There I\u2019ll stand and watch and listen\n                Till I see thy white plumes glisten,\n                Hear thy angel-pinions sweeping\n                Upward through the ether clear;\n                Then, beloved, at Heaven\u2019s gate meeting,\n                This shall be my joyous greeting,\n                \u201cLove, I\u2019m waiting for thee here.\u201d\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                         ASAPH HALL, CARPENTER.Like many other impecunious Americans (Angeline Stickney included),\nAsaph Hall, carpenter, and afterwards astronomer, came of excellent\nfamily.He was descended from John Hall, of Wallingford, Conn., who\nserved in the Pequot War.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.The same John Hall was the progenitor of Lyman\nHall, signer of the Declaration of Independence and Governor of Georgia.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.The carpenter\u2019s great-grandfather, David Hall, an original proprietor of\nGoshen, Conn., was killed in battle near Lake George on that fatal 8th\nof September, 1755.[1] His grandfather, Asaph Hall 1st, saw service in\nthe Revolution as captain of Connecticut militia.This Asaph and his\nsister Alice went from Wallingford about 1755, to become Hall pioneers\nin Goshen, Conn., where they lived in a log house.Alice married; Asaph\nprospered, and in 1767 built himself a large house.He was a friend of\nEthan Allen, was with him at the capture of Ticonderoga, and was one of\nthe chief patriots of Goshen.He saw active service as a soldier, served\ntwenty-four times in the State legislature, and was a member of the\nState convention called to ratify the Federal Constitution.Hall Meadow,\na fertile valley in the town of Goshen, still commemorates his name.He\naccumulated considerable property, so that his only child, the second\nAsaph Hall, born in 1800 a few months after his death, was brought up a\nyoung gentleman, and fitted to enter Yale College.But the mother\nrefused to be separated from her son, and before he became of age she\nset him up in business.His inheritance rapidly slipped away; and in\n1842 he died in Georgia, where he was selling clocks, manufactured in\nhis Goshen factory.Footnote 1:\n\n  _See Wallingford Land Records, vol.541._\n\nAsaph Hall 3rd, born October 15, 1829, was the eldest of six children.His early boyhood was spent in easy circumstances, and he early acquired\na taste for good literature.But at thirteen he was called upon to help\nhis mother rescue the wreckage of his father\u2019s property.Fortunately,\nthe Widow, Hannah (Palmer) Hall, was a woman of sterling character, a\ndaughter of Robert Palmer, first of Stonington, then of Goshen, Conn.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.To\nher Asaph Hall 3rd owed in large measure his splendid physique; and who\ncan say whether his mental powers were inherited from father or mother?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.For three years the widow and her children struggled to redeem a\nmortgaged farm.During one of these years they made and sold ten\nthousand pounds of cheese, at six cents a pound.It was a losing fight,\nso the widow retired to a farm free from mortgage, and young Asaph, now\nsixteen, was apprenticed to Herrick and Dunbar, carpenters.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.He served an\napprenticeship of three years, receiving his board and five dollars a\nmonth.During his first year as a journeyman he earned twenty-two\ndollars a month and board; and as he was still under age he gave one\nhundred dollars of his savings to his mother.Her house was always home\nto him; and when cold weather put a stop to carpentry, he returned\nthither to help tend cattle or to hunt gray squirrels.For the young\ncarpenter was fond of hunting.One winter he studied geometry and algebra with a Mr.Rice, principal of\nthe Norfolk Academy.But he found he was a better mathematician than his\nteacher.Indeed, he had hardly begun his studies at McGrawville when he\ndistinguished himself by solving a problem which up to that time had\nbaffled students and teachers alike.Massachusetts educators would have us believe that a young man of\ntwenty-five should have spent nine years in primary and grammar schools,\nfour years more in a high school, four years more at college, and three\nyears more in some professional school.Supposing the victim to have\nbegun his career in a kindergarten at the age of three, and to have\npursued a two-years\u2019 course there, at twenty-five his education would be\ncompleted.He would have finished his education, provided his education\nhad not finished him.Now at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five Asaph Hall 3rd only began\nserious study.He brought to his tasks the vigor of an unspoiled youth,\nspent in the open air.He worked as only a man of mature strength can\nwork, and he comprehended as only a man of keen, undulled intellect can\ncomprehend.His ability as a scholar called forth the admiration of\nfellow-students and the encouragement of teachers.The astronomer\nBr\u00fcnnow, buried in the wilds of Michigan, far from his beloved Germany,\nrecognized in this American youth a worthy disciple, and Dr.Benjamin\nApthorp Gould, father of American astronomy, promptly adopted Asaph Hall\ninto his scientific family.If our young American\u2019s experience puts conventional theories of\neducation to the blush, much more does his manhood reflect upon the\ntheory that unites intellectuality with personal impurity.The historian\nLecky throws a glamor over the loathesomeness of what is politely known\nas the social evil, and calls the prostitute a modern priestess.And it\nis well known that German university students of these degenerate days\nconsider continence an absurdity.Asaph Hall was as pure as Sir\nGallahad, who sang:\n\n                My good blade carves the casques of men,\n                My tough lance thrusteth sure,\n                My strength is as the strength of ten,\n                Because my heart is pure.Let it be conceded that this untutored American youth had had an\nexcellent course in manual training\u2014anticipating the modern fad in\neducation by half a century.However, he had never belonged to an Arts\nand Crafts Movement, and had never made dinky little what-nots or other\nuseless and fancy articles.He had spent eight years at carpenter work;\nthree years as an apprentice and five years as a journeyman, and he was\na skilful and conscientious workman.He handled his tools as only\ncarpenters of his day and generation were used to handle them, making\ndoors, blinds, and window-sashes, as well as hewing timbers for the\nframes of houses.Monuments of his handiwork, in the shape of well-built\nhouses, are to be seen in Connecticut and Massachusetts to this day.Like other young men of ability, he was becomingly modest, and his boss,\nold Peter Bogart, used to say with a twinkle in his eye, that of all the\nmen in his employ, Asaph Hall was the only one who didn\u2019t know more than\nPeter Bogart.And yet it was Asaph Hall who showed his fellow carpenters how to\nconstruct the roof of a house scientifically.\u201cCut and try\u201d was their\nrule; and if the end of a joist was spoilt by too frequent application\nof the rule, they took another joist.But the young carpenter knew the\nthing could be done right the first time; and so, without the aid of\ntext-book or instructor, he worked the problem out, by the principles of\nprojection.The timbers sawed according to his directions fitted\nperfectly, and his companions marveled.To himself the incident meant much, for he had proved himself more than\na carpenter.His ambition was aroused, and he resolved to become an\narchitect.But a kindly Providence led him on to a still nobler calling.In 1854 he set out for McGrawville thinking that by the system of manual\nlabor there advertised he could earn his way as he studied.When the\nstage rolled into town, whom should he see but Angeline Stickney,\ndressed in her \u201cbloomer\u201d costume!\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                        COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.President Eliot of Harvard University is quoted as saying that marriage\nought to unite two persons of the same religious faith: otherwise it is\nlikely to prove unhappy.President Eliot has said many wise things, but\nthis is not one of them\u2014unless he is shrewdly seeking to produce\nbachelors and spinsters to upbuild his university.One of Angeline\nStickney\u2019s girl friends had a suitor of the Universalist denomination,\nand a very fine man he was; but the girl and her mother belonged to the\nBaptist denomination, which was the denomination of another suitor, whom\nshe married for denominational reasons.Abbreviating the word, her\nexperience proves the following principle: If a young woman belonging to\nthe Baptist demnition rejects an eligible suitor because he belongs to\nthe Universalist demnition, she is likely to go to the demnition\nbow-wows.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.For religious tolerance even in matrimony there is the best of reasons:\nWe are Protestants before we are Baptists or Universalists, Christians\nbefore we are Catholics or Protestants, moralists before we are Jews or\nChristians, theists before we are Mohammedans or Jews, and human before\nevery thing else.Angeline Stickney, like her girl friend, was a sincere Baptist.Had\njoined the church at the age of sixteen.One of her classmates, a person\nof deeply religious feeling like herself, was a suitor for her hand.But\nshe married Asaph Hall, who was outside the pale of any religious sect,\ndisbelieved in woman-suffrage, wasted little sympathy on <DW64>s, and\nplayed cards!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.And her marriage was infinitely more fortunate than her\nfriend\u2019s.To be sure she labored to convert her splendid Pagan, and\npartially succeeded; but in the end he converted her, till the Unitarian\nchurch itself was too narrow for her.Cupid\u2019s ways are strange, and sometimes whimsical.There was once a\nyoung man who made fun of a red-haired woman and used to say to his\ncompanions, \u201cGet ready, get ready,\u201d till Reddy got him!No doubt the\nlittle god scored a point when Asaph Hall saw Angeline Stickney solemnly\nparading in the \u201cbloomer\u201d costume.Good humor was one of the young man\u2019s\ncharacteristics, and no doubt he had a hearty laugh at the young lady\u2019s\nexpense.But Dan Cupid contrived to have him pursue a course in geometry\ntaught by Miss Stickney; and, to make it all the merrier, entangled him\nin a plot to down the teacher by asking hard questions.The teacher did\nnot down, admiration took the place of mischief, and Cupid smiled upon a\npair of happy lovers.The love-scenes, the tender greetings and affectionate farewells, the\nardent avowals and gracious answers\u2014all these things, so essential to\nthe modern novel, are known only in heaven.The lovers have lived their\nlives and passed away.Some words of endearment are preserved in their\nold letters\u2014but these, gentle reader, are none of your business.However, I may state with propriety a few facts in regard to Angeline\nStickney\u2019s courtship and marriage.It was characteristic of her that\nbefore she became engaged to marry she told Asaph Hall all about her\nfather.He, wise lover, could distinguish between sins of the stomach\nand sins of the heart, and risked the hereditary taint pertaining to the\nformer\u2014and this although she emphasized the danger by breaking down and\nbecoming a pitiable invalid.Just before her graduation she wrote:\n\n    I believe God sent you to love me just at this time, that I might\n    not get discouraged.How very good and beautiful you seemed to me that Saturday night\n    that I was sick at Mr.Porter\u2019s, and you still seem just the same.I\n    hope I may sometime repay you for all your kindness and love to me.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.If I have already brightened your hopes and added to your joy I am\n    thankful.I hope we may always be a blessing to each other and to\n    all around us; and that the great object of our lives may be the\n    good that we can do.There are a great many things I wish to say to\n    you, but I will not try to write them now.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.I hope I shall see you\n    again soon, and then I can tell you all with my own lips.Do not\n    study too hard, Love, and give yourself rest and sleep as much as\n    you need.Yours truly,\n\n                A. HALL.C. A. S.\n\nAfter her graduation, Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.Hall accompanied her to Rodman, where he\nvisited her people a week or ten days\u2014a procedure always attended with\ndanger to Dan Cupid\u2019s plans.In this case, it is said the young\ncarpenter was charmed with the buxom sister Ruth, who was, in fact, a\nmuch more marriageable woman than Angeline.But he went about to get the\nengagement ring, which, in spite of a Puritanical protest against such\nadornment, was faithfully worn for twenty years.At last the busy\nhousewife burned her fingers badly washing lamp-chimneys with carbolic\nacid, and her astronomer husband filed asunder the slender band of gold.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.That the Puritan maiden disdained the feminine display by which less\nmanly lovers are ensnared is illustrated by the following extract from a\nletter to Mr.Hall:\n\n    Last week Wednesday I went to Saratoga.Staid there till the\n    afternoon of the next day.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.Antoinette L. Brown, Lucy Stone Blackwell,\n    Ernestine Rose, Samuel J. May, and T. W. Higginson.The streets of Saratoga were thronged with fashionables.I never saw\n    before such a display of dress.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.Poor gilded butterflies, no object\n    in life but to make a display of their fine colors.I could not help\n    contrasting those ladies of fashion with the earnest, noble, working\n    women who stood up there in that Convention, and with words of\n    eloquence urged upon their sisters the importance of awaking to\n    usefulness.This letter was written in August, 1855, when Angeline Stickney was\nvisiting friends and relatives in quest of health.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.In the same letter\nshe sent directions for Mr.Hall to meet her in Albany on his way to\nMcGrawville; but for some reason", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "This was a grievous\ndisappointment, of which she used to speak in after years.But in a few days they were together at McGrawville, where she remained\nten weeks\u2014visiting friends, of course.November 13 she set out for\nWisconsin, hoping to find employment as a teacher near her sister\nCharlotte Ingalls.At depots and\nhotels, during the journey westward, she thought of the absent lover,\nand sent him long messages.In one letter she said:\n\n    One night I dreamed you had gone away somewhere, without letting any\n    one know where, and I tried to find where you had gone but could\n    not.When I awoke it still\n    seemed a reality.... You must be a good boy and not go away where I\n    shall not know where you are.... It makes my heart ache to think\n    what a long weary way it is from Wisconsin to McGrawville.In the same letter she speaks about lengthening a poem, so that the time\noccupied in reading it was about twenty minutes.Hall rather discouraged his wife\u2019s inclination to write verses.Is it\npossible that he flattered her before marriage?If so, it was no more\nthan her other admirers did.Again, in the same letter, she pleads for the cultivation of religion:\n\n    Did you go to the prayer-meeting last evening?It seemed to me that\n    you were there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.If you do not wish to go alone I am sure Mr.You must take some time, Love, to think of the\n    life beyond the grave.You must not be so much engaged in your\n    studies that you cannot have time to think about it and prepare for\n    it.About the middle of December she had reached Elkhorn, Wisconsin, where\nshe remained a fortnight with Elder Bright, her old pastor.Then she\nwent to her sister Charlotte\u2019s, at Milford.In one of her letters from\nthis place she speaks of going surveying.It seems the surveyor of the\nneighborhood was surprised to find a woman who understood his business.In the latter part of December, Asaph Hall returned to Goshen, Conn.Hence the following letter:\n\n                                                GOSHEN, Jan.DEAREST ANGIE:... I think of you a great deal, Angie, and sometimes\n    when I feel how much better and holier you are than I am, I think\n    that I ought to go through with much trial and affliction before I\n    shall be fitted for your companion.In this way I presume that my\n    letters have been shaded by my occasional sad thoughts.But Angie\n    you _must not_ let them affect you any more, or cherish gloomy\n    thoughts about me.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.I would not drive the color from your cheek or\n    give you one bad thought concerning me for the world.I want, very\n    much, to see you look healthy and strong when I meet you.... Every\n    time I go away from home, among strangers, I feel my need of you.My\n    friends here, even my sisters, seem cold and distant when compared\n    with you.O there is no one like the dear one who nestles in our\n    hearts, and loves us always.My mother loves me, and is very dear to\n    me, and my sisters too, but then they have so many other things to\n    think about that their sympathies are drawn towards other objects.I\n    must have you, Angie, to love me, and we will find a good happy home\n    somewhere, never fear.And now you must be cheerful and hopeful, try\n    to get rid of your headaches, and healthy as fast as you can.... You\n    must remember that I love you very much, and that with you life\n    looks bright and hopeful, while if I should lose you I fear that I\n    should become sour and disheartened, a hater of my kind.Yours Truly,\n\n                A. HALL.Hall was in Milford, Wisconsin, whence he wrote to\nAngeline\u2019s mother as follows:\n\n                                          MILFORD, WISCONSIN, Feb.WOODWARD:... I find Angeline with her health much\n    improved.... We expect to be married some time this spring.I fear\n    that I shall fail to fulfil the old rule, which says that a man\n    should build his house before he gets his wife, and shall commence a\n    new life rather poor in worldly goods.But then we know how, and are\n    not ashamed to work, and feel trustful of the future.At least, I am\n    sure that we shall feel stronger, and better fitted to act an\n    honorable part in life, when we are living together, and encouraging\n    each other, than we could otherwise.I know that this will be the\n    case with myself, and shall try to make it so with Angeline.Yours Sincerely,\n\n                ASAPH HALL.This hardly sounds like the epistle of a reluctant lover; and yet\ntradition says the young carpenter hesitated to marry; and for a brief\nseason Angeline Stickney remembered tearfully that other McGrawville\nsuitor who loved her well, but whose bashful love was too tardy to\nforestall the straightforward Mr.\u201cThe course of true love never\ndid run smooth.\u201d In this case, the trouble seems to have been the lady\u2019s\nfeeble health.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.When they were married she was very weak, and it looked\nas if she could not live more than two or three years.But her mental\npowers were exceptionally strong, and she remembered tenaciously for\nmany a year the seeming wrong.However, under date of April 2, 1856, Angeline wrote to her sister Mary,\nfrom Ann Arbor, Michigan:\n\n    Mr.Hall and I went to Elder Bright\u2019s and staid over Sunday.We were\n    married Monday morning, and started for this place in the afternoon.Hall came here for the purpose of pursuing his studies.Shall remain here during the summer term,\n    and perhaps three or four years.And so Asaph Hall studied astronomy under the famous Br\u00fcnnow, and French\nunder Fasquelle.And he used to carry his frail wife on his back across\nthe fields to hunt wild flowers.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                      ANN ARBOR AND SHALERSVILLE.Christopher, the strong man who\nserved his masters well, but was dissatisfied in their service until he\nheard of the Lord and Master Jesus Christ?\u2014how he then served gladly at\na ford, carrying pilgrims across on his back\u2014how one day a little child\nasked to be carried across, and perching on his broad shoulders grew\nheavier and heavier till the strong man nearly sank beneath the weight?But he struggled manfully over the treacherous stones, and with a\nsupreme effort bore his charge safely through the waters.And behold,\nthe little child was Christ himself!I think of that legend when I think of the poor ambitious scholar,\nliterally saddled by his invalid wife.For three years he hardly kept\nhis head above water.At one time he thought he could go no further, and\nproposed that she stay with his mother while he gained a better footing.But she pleaded hard, and he struggled through, to receive the reward of\nduty nobly done.But in that time Asaph\nHall had made so favorable an impression that Professor Br\u00fcnnow urged\nhim to continue his studies, and arranged matters so that he might\nattend college at Ann Arbor as long as he chose without paying tuition\nfees.Angeline made plans for her sister Ruth and husband to move to\nMichigan, where Asaph could build them a house.They went southward into Ohio,\nwhere they spent a month with Angeline\u2019s Aunt Achsah Taylor, her\nmother\u2019s sister.You may be sure they earned their board, Angeline in\nthe house and Asaph in the hayfield.Uncle Taylor was a queer old\nfellow, shedding tears when his hay got wet, and going off to the hotel\nfor dinner when his wife happened to give him the wrong end of a fish.August 6, 1856, they arrived at Shalersville, Ohio, where they had\nengaged to teach at the Shalersville Institute.Here they remained till\nabout May 1 of the next year, when Angeline returned to Rodman with\nfunds enough to pay with interest the money borrowed from her cousin\nJoseph Downs; and Asaph proceeded to Cambridge, Mass., where the\ndirector of the Harvard Observatory was in need of an assistant.Let it not be inferred that teaching at Shalersville was financially\nprofitable.Asaph Hall concluded that he preferred carpentry.And yet,\nin the best sense they were most successful\u2014things went smoothly\u2014their\npupils, some of them school teachers, were apt\u2014and they were well liked\nby the people of Shalersville.Indeed, to induce them to keep school the\nlast term the townspeople presented them with a purse of sixty dollars\nto eke out their income.Asaph Hall turned his mechanical skill to use\nby making a prism, a three-sided receptacle of glass filled with water.Saturdays he held a sort of smoke-talk for the boys\u2014the smoke feature\nabsent\u2014and at least one country boy was inspired to step up higher.The little wife was proud of her manly husband, as the following passage\nfrom a letter to her sister Ruth shows:\n\n    He is real good, and we are very happy.He is a real noble, true man\n    besides being an extra scholar, so you must never be concerned about\n    my not being happy with him.He will take just the best care of me\n    that he possibly can.It appears also that she was converting her husband to the profession of\nreligion.Before he left Ohio he actually united with the Campbellites,\nand was baptized.In the letter just quoted Angeline says:\n\n    We have been reading some of the strongest arguments against the\n    Christian religion, also several authors who support religion, and\n    he has come to the conclusion that all the argument is on the side\n    of Christianity.When he was threatened with\na severe fever, she wrapped him up in hot, wet blankets, and succeeded\nin throwing the poison off through the pores of the skin.So they\ncherished each other in sickness and in health.Angeline\u2019s cousin Mary Gilman, once a student at McGrawville, came to\nShalersville seeking to enlarge the curriculum of the institute with a\ncourse in fine arts.She hindered more than she helped, and in January\nwent away\u2014but not till she had taught Angeline to paint in oil.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.News came of the death of Joseph\nDowns, and Angeline wrote to her aunt, his mother:\n\n    He always seemed like a brother to me.I remember all our long walks\n    and rides to school.How kind it was in him to carry me all that\n    cold winter.Then our rides to church, and all the times we have\n    been together.... I can send you the money I owed him any time.... I\n    never can be enough obliged to him for his kindness in lending me\n    that money, and I wished to see him very much, that I might tell him\n    how thankful I felt when he sent it to me.Her sister Ruth wrote:\n\n    Sweet sister, I am so _very lonely_.It would do me so much good to\n    tell you all I wish.I have never found... one so _willing to share\n    all my grief and joy_.But when Angeline did at length return to Rodman, Ruth\u2019s comfort must\nhave been mixed with pain.A letter to Asaph tells the story:\n\n    It is almost dark, but I wish to write a few words to you before I\n    go to bed.I have had one of those bad spells of paralysis this\n    afternoon, so that I could not speak for a minute or two.... I do\n    not know what is to become of me.If I had some quiet little room\n    with you perhaps I might get strength slowly and be good for\n    something after awhile.... I do not mourn much for the blasting of\n    my own hopes of usefulness; but I can not bear to be the canker worm\n    destroying all your beautiful buds of promise.She remained in poor health a long time\u2014so thin and pale that old\nacquaintances hardly knew her.She wrote:\n\n    I feel something as a stranger feels in a strange land I guess.This\n    makes me turn to you with all the more love.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                            STRENUOUS TIMES.They had left Shalersville resolved that Asaph should continue his\nstudies, but undecided where to go.Professor Br\u00fcnnow invited him to Ann\nArbor; and Mr.Bond, director of the Harvard College Observatory,\nencouraged him to go there.Besides, the famous mathematician Benjamin\nPeirce taught at Harvard.Not till they reached Cleveland was the\ndecision made.The way West was barred by a storm on Lake Erie, and\nAngeline said, \u201cLet\u2019s go East.\u201d\n\nSo she returned to Rodman for a visit, while her husband set out for\nHarvard University.Fifty years and more have passed since then.Their\nfour sons have long since graduated at Harvard, and growing\ngrandchildren are turning their eyes thither.Hall talked with\nProfessors Peirce and Bond, and with the dean of the faculty, Professor\nHosford.All gave him encouragement, and he proceeded to Plymouth\nHollow, Conn., now called Thomaston, to earn money enough at carpentry\nto give him a start.He earned the highest wages given to carpenters at\nthat time, a dollar and a half a day; but his wife\u2019s poor health almost\ndiscouraged him.On May 19, 1857, he wrote her as follows:\n\n    I get along very well with my work, and try to study a little in the\n    evenings, but find it rather hard business after a day\u2019s labor.... I\n    don\u2019t fairly know what we had better do, whether I had better keep\n    on with my studies or not.It would be much pleasanter for you, I\n    suppose, were I to give up the pursuit of my studies, and try to get\n    us a home.But then, as I have no tact for money-making by\n    speculation, and it would take so long to earn enough with my hands\n    to buy a home, we should be old before it would be accomplished, and\n    in this case, my studies would have to be given up forever.I do not\n    like to do this, for it seems to me that with two years\u2019 more study\n    I can attain a position in which I can command a decent salary.Perhaps in less time, I can pay my way at Cambridge, either by\n    teaching or by assisting in the Observatory.But how and where we\n    shall live during the two years is the difficulty.I shall try to\n    make about sixty dollars before the first of August.With this money\n    I think that I could stay at Cambridge one year and might possibly\n    find a situation so that we might make our home there.But I think that it is not best that we should both go to Cambridge\n    with so little money, and run the risk of my finding employment.You\n    must come here and stay with our folks until I get something\n    arranged at Cambridge, and then, I hope that we can have a permanent\n    home.... Make up your mind to be a stout-hearted little woman for a\n    couple of years.But Angeline begged to go to Cambridge with him, although she wrote:\n\n    These attacks are so sudden, I might be struck down instantly, or\n    become helpless or senseless.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.About the first of July she went to Goshen, Conn., to stay with his\nmother, in whom she found a friend.Though very delicate, she was\nindustrious.Her husband\u2019s strong twin sisters wondered how he would\nsucceed with such a poor, weak little wife.But Asaph\u2019s mother assured\nher son that their doubts were absurd, as Angeline accomplished as much\nas both the twins together.So it came to pass that in the latter part of August, 1857, Asaph Hall\narrived in Cambridge with fifty dollars in his pocket and an invalid\nwife on his arm.George Bond, son of the director of the\nobservatory, told him bluntly that if he followed astronomy he would\nstarve.He had no money, no social position, no friends.What right had\nhe and his delicate wife to dream of a scientific career?The best the\nHarvard Observatory could do for him the first six months of his stay\nwas to pay three dollars a week for his services.Then his pay was\nadvanced to four dollars.Early in 1858 he got some extra work\u2014observing\nmoon-culminations in connection with Col.Joseph E. Johnston\u2019s army\nengineers.For each observation he received a dollar; and fortune so far\nfavored the young astronomer that in the month of March he made\ntwenty-three such observations.His faithful wife, as regular as an\nalarm clock, would waken him out of a sound sleep and send him off to\nthe observatory.In 1858, also, he began to eke out his income by\ncomputing almanacs, earning the first year about one hundred and thirty\ndollars; but competition soon made such work unprofitable.In less than\na year he had won the respect of Mr.George Bond by solving problems\nwhich that astronomer was unable to solve; and at length, in the early\npart of 1859, upon the death of the elder Bond, his pay was raised to\nfour hundred dollars a year.After his experience such a salary seemed quite munificent.The twin\nsisters visited Cambridge and were much dissatisfied with Asaph\u2019s\npoverty.They tried to persuade Angeline to make him go into some more\nprofitable business.Sibley, college librarian, observing his shabby\novercoat and thin face, exclaimed, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t live on bread and\nmilk!\u201d The young man was living on astronomy, and his delicate wife was\naiding and abetting him.In less than a year after his arrival at\nCambridge, he had become a good observer.He\nwas pursuing his studies with great ardor.He read _Br\u00fcnnow\u2019s Astronomy_\nin German, which language his wife taught him mornings as he kindled the\nfire.In 1858 he was reading _Gauss\u2019s Theoria Motus_.Angeline was determined her husband should make good use of the talents\nGod had given him.She was courageous as only a Puritan can be.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.In\ndomestic economy she was unsurpassed.Husband and wife lived on much\nless than the average college student requires.She mended their old\nclothes again and again, turning the cloth; and economized with\ndesperate energy.At first they rented rooms and had the use of the kitchen in a house on\nConcord Avenue, near the observatory.But their landlady proving to be a\nwoman of bad character, after eight or nine months they moved to a\ntenement house near North Avenue, where they lived a year.Here they\nsub-let one of their rooms to a German pack-peddler, a thrifty man,\nfree-thinker and socialist, who was attracted to Mrs.He used to argue with her, and to read to her from\nhis books, until finally she refused to listen to his doctrines,\nwhereupon he got very angry, paid his rent, and left.One American feels himself as good as another\u2014if not better\u2014especially\nwhen brought up in a new community.But Cambridge was settled long ago,\nand social distinctions are observed there.It was rather exasperating\nto Asaph Hall and his wife to be snubbed and ignored and meanly treated\nbecause they were poor and without friends.Even their grocer seemed to\nsnub them, sending them bad eggs.You may be sure they quit him\npromptly, finding an honest grocer in Cambridgeport, a Deacon Holmes.Relieved of petty social cares\nand distractions a man can work.Hall, writing to her sister Mary,\nFebruary 4, 1859, declared her husband was \u201cgetting to be a _grand_\nscholar\u201d:\n\n   .... A little more study and Mr.Hall will be excelled by few in\n    this country in his department of science.Indeed that is the case\n    now, though he is not very widely known yet.In another letter, dated December 15, 1858, she wrote:\n\n    People are beginning to know something of Mr.May 4, 1858 she wrote:\n\n    Mr.Hall has just finished computing the elements of the orbit of\n    one [a comet] which have been published neatly in the _Astronomical\n    Journal_.B. A. Gould, editor of the Journal, became acquainted with\nthe young astronomer who was afterward his firm friend and his associate\nin the National Academy of Sciences.Merit wins recognition\u2014recognition of the kind which is worth while.It\nwas not many months before the Halls found friends among quiet,\nunassuming people, and formed friendships that lasted for life.It was\nworth much to become acquainted with Dr.In a letter of February 4, 1859, already cited, Mrs.Hall and I have both had some nice presents this winter,\u201d and she\nmentions a Mrs.Pritchett, an astronomer clergyman from Missouri, was the father of Dr.Henry S. Pritchett, a recent president of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology.Hall had given him some assistance in his studies; and\ntwenty years afterward Henry S. Pritchett, the son, became a member of\nthe Hall family.Hall, on the first May-day spent\nin Cambridge; \u201cthe children are keeping May-day something like the old\nEnglish fashion.It is a beautiful day, the warmest we have had this\nspring.Got some dandelions, and\nblossoms of the soft maple.Have made quite a pretty bouquet.\u201d The tone\nof morbidness was beginning to disappear from her letters, for her\nhealth was improving.Her religious views were growing broader and more\nreasonable, also.Too poor to rent a pew in any of the churches, she and\nher husband attended the college chapel, where they heard the Rev.In the following poem, suggested by one of his sermons, she\nseems to embody the heroic experience of those early days in Cambridge:\n\n                   \u201cTHE MOUNTAINS SHALL BRING PEACE.\u201d\n\n         O grand, majestic mountain!far extending\n             In height, and breadth, and length,\u2014\n         Fast fixed to earth yet ever heavenward tending,\n             Calm, steadfast in thy strength!Type of the Christian, thou;

but it was necessary to\nform a body-guard to escort him home.Asaph Hall was a six-footer, and\nbelieved in fair play; so he joined the little knot of men who bore\nPhillips safely through the surging crowd.In after years he used to\ntell of Phillips\u2019 apparent unconcern, and of his courteous bow of thanks\nwhen arrived at his doorstep.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.Angeline Hall had an adventure no less interesting.She became\nacquainted with a shrewd old negress, called Moses, who had helped many\nslaves escape North, stirring up mobs, when necessary, to free the\nfugitives from the custody of officers.One day she went with Moses to\ncall upon the poet Lowell.Was glad to have\na chat with the old woman, and smilingly asked her if it did not trouble\nher conscience to resist the law.Moses was ready to resist the law\nagain, and Lowell gave her some money.Superstitious people hailed the advent of Donati\u2019s comet as a sign of\nwar\u2014and Angeline Hall was yet to mourn the loss of friends upon the\nbattlefield.But hoping for peace and loving astronomy, she published\nthe following verses in a local newspaper:\n\n                            DONATI\u2019S COMET.O, not in wrath but lovingly,\n                  In beauty pure and high,\n                Bright shines the stranger visitant,\n                  A glory in our sky.No harbinger of pestilence\n                  Nor battle\u2019s fearful din;\n                Then open wide, ye gates of heaven,\n                  And let the stranger in.It seems a spirit visible\n                  Through some diviner air,\n                With burning stars upon her brow\n                  And in her shining hair.Through veil translucent, luminous\n                  Shines out her starry face,\n                And wrapped in robes of light she glides\n                  Still through the silent space.And fill till it o\u2019errun\n                Thy silver horn thou ancient moon,\n                  From fountains of the sun!But open wide the golden gates\n                  Into your realm of Even,\n                And let the angel presence pass\n                  In glory through the heaven.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                           LOVE IN A COTTAGE.Miss Sarah Waitt, a Cambridge school-teacher of beautiful character, and\nfirm friend of Angeline Hall, once said, after an acquaintance of thirty\nyears or more, that she had never known of a happier married life than\nthat of Mr.He opposed his wife\u2019s writing\npoetry\u2014not from an aversion to poetry, but because poetry inferior to\nthe best is of little value.The wife, accustomed as an invalid to his\nthoughtful attentions, missed his companionship as health returned.What\nwere her feelings the first night she found herself obliged to walk home\nalone!But thereafter, like a more consistent apostle of woman\u2019s rights,\nshe braved the night alone wherever duty led.She undertook to help her\nhusband in his computations, but, failing to persuade him that her time\nwas worth as much as his, she quit work.He could, indeed, compute much\nfaster than she, but she feelingly demanded a man\u2019s wages.However, this labor trouble subsided without resort to boycott.The most\nserious quarrel\u2014and for a time it was very dreadful\u2014arose in this way:\n\nIt is well known that Boston is the intellectual and moral centre of the\ncountry, in fact of the world; the hub of the universe, as it were.There in ancient times witchcraft and the Quaker superstition were\ngently but firmly discouraged (compare _Giles Corey_, Longfellow\u2019s fine\ndrama, long since suppressed by Boston publishers).There in modern\ntimes descendants of the Puritans practice race-suicide and Irishmen\npractice politics.There a white man is looked upon as the equal of a\n<DW64>, though somewhat inferior, in many ways, to the Boston woman.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.Now\nit so happened that some Boston and Cambridge ladies of Angeline Hall\u2019s\nacquaintance had resolved beyond equivocation that woman should\nthenceforth be emancipated from skirts.Hall, in college days, had worn the \u201cbloomer\u201d costume.So they very\ngenerously suggested that she have the honor of inaugurating bloomers in\nBoston and vicinity.Truly it showed a self-sacrificing spirit on the\npart of these ladies to allow this comparatively unknown sister to reap\nthe honor due her who should abolish skirts.They would not for one\nmoment think of robbing her of this honor by donning bloomers\nthemselves.They could only suggest that the reform be instituted\nwithout delay, and they were eager to see how much the Boston public\nwould appreciate it.He reminded his wife that they were just struggling\nto their feet, and the bloomers might ruin their prospects.A pure-minded woman to be interfered with in this manner!And worse than that, to think that she had married a coward!\u201cA\ncoward\u201d\u2014yes, that is what she called him.It so happened, shortly\nafterward, that the astronomer, returning home one night, found his wife\nby the doorstep watching a blazing lamp, on the point of explosion.He\nstepped up and dropped his observing cap over the lamp.Whereupon she\nsaid, \u201cYou _are_ brave!\u201d Strange she had not noticed it before!<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.Asaph Hall used to aver that a family quarrel is not always a bad thing.Could he have been thinking of his\nown experience?It is possible that the little quarrels indicated above\nled to a clearer understanding of the separate duties of husband and\nwife, and thence to a division of labor in the household.Then one of the local engineers suggested that\nthe sand hills should be carefully explored, and now a long reservoir\nin the very center of those hills fills with water naturally and\nsupplies the entire town.All this goes to prove to our mind that if Seals do not apparently\ndrink, if Cormorants and Penguins, Giraffes, Snakes, and Reptiles seem\nto care nothing for water, some of them do eat wet or moist food, while\nthe Giraffe, for one, enjoys the juices of the leaves of trees that\nhave their roots in the moisture.None of these animals are our common,\neveryday pets.If they were, it would cost us nothing to put water\nat their disposal, but that they never drink in their native haunts\n\"can not be proved until the deserts have been explored and the total\nabsence of water confirmed.\"--_Ex._\n\n\n\n\n  [Illustration: From col.CHICAGO COLORTYPE CO.,\n                 CHIC.Just how many species of Gulls there are has not yet been determined,\nbut the habits and locations of about twenty-six species have been\ndescribed.The American Herring Gull is found throughout North America,\nnesting from Maine northward, and westward throughout the interior on\nthe large inland waters, and occasionally on the Pacific; south in\nthe winter to Cuba and lower California.This Gull is a common bird\nthroughout its range, particularly coast-wise.Goss in his \"Birds of Kansas,\" writes as follows of the Herring\nGull:\n\n\"In the month of June, 1880, I found the birds nesting in large\ncommunities on the little island adjacent to Grand Manan; many were\nnesting in spruce tree tops from twenty to forty feet from the ground.It was an odd sight to see them on their nests or perched upon a limb,\nchattering and scolding as approached.\"In the trees I had no difficulty in finding full sets of their eggs,\nas the egg collectors rarely take the trouble to climb, but on the\nrocks I was unable to find an egg within reach, the 'eggers' going\ndaily over the rocks.I was told by several that they yearly robbed the\nbirds, taking, however, but nine eggs from a nest, as they found that\nwhenever they took a greater number, the birds so robbed would forsake\ntheir nests, or, as they expressed it, cease to lay, and that in order\nto prevent an over-collection they invariably drop near the nest a\nlittle stone or pebble for every egg taken.\"They do not leave their nesting grounds\nuntil able to fly, though, half-grown birds are sometimes seen on the\nwater that by fright or accident have fallen.The nests are composed\nof grass and moss.Some of them are large and elaborately made, while\nothers are merely shallow depressions with a slight lining.Three eggs\nare usually laid, which vary from bluish-white to a deep yellowish\nbrown, spotted and blotched with brown of different shades.In many\ncases where the Herring Gull has suffered persecution, it has been\nknown to depart from its usual habit of nesting on the open seashore.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.It is a pleasure to watch a flock of Gulls riding buoyantly upon the\nwater.They do not dive, as many suppose, but only immerse the head\nand neck.They are omnivorous and greedy eaters; \"scavengers of the\nbeach, and in the harbors to be seen boldly alighting upon the masts\nand flying about the vessels, picking up the refuse matter as soon as\nit is cast overboard, and often following the steamers from thirty\nto forty miles from the land, and sometimes much farther.\"They are\never upon the alert, with a quick eye that notices every floating\nobject or disturbance of the water, and as they herald with screams\nthe appearance of the Herring or other small fishes that often swim in\nschools at the surface of the water, they prove an unerring pilot to\nthe fishermen who hastily follow with their lines and nets, for they\nknow that beneath and following the valuable catch in sight are the\nlarger fishes that are so intent upon taking the little ones in out of\nthe wet as largely to forget their cunning, and thus make their capture\nan easy one.Very large flocks of Gulls, at times appearing many hundreds, are\nseen on Lake Michigan.We recently saw in the vicinity of Milwaukee\na flock of what we considered to be many thousands of these birds,\nflying swiftly, mounting up, and falling, as if to catch themselves,\nin wide circles, the sun causing their wings and sides to glisten like\nburnished silver.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple there.It is claimed that two hundred millions of dollars that should go to\nthe farmer, the gardner, and the fruit grower in the United States are\nlost every year by the ravages of insects--that is to say, one-tenth of\nour agricultural product is actually destroyed by them.The Department\nof Agriculture has made a thorough investigation of this subject, and", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "The ravages of the Gypsy Moth in\nthree counties in Massachusetts for several years annually cost the\nstate $100,000.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.\"Now, as rain is the natural check to drought, so birds\nare the natural check to insects, for what are pests to the farmer\nare necessities of life to the bird.It is calculated that an average\ninsectivorous bird destroys 2,400 insects in a year; and when it is\nremembered that there are over 100,000 kinds of insects in the United\nStates, the majority of which are injurious, and that in some cases\na single individual in a year may become the progenitor of several\nbillion descendants, it is seen how much good birds do ordinarily\nby simple prevention.\"All of which has reference chiefly to the\nindispensableness of preventing by every possible means the destruction\nof the birds whose food largely consists of insects.But many of our so-called birds of prey, which have been thought to\nbe the enemies of the agriculturist and have hence been ruthlessly\ndestroyed, are equally beneficial.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.Fisher, an authority on the\nsubject, in referring to the injustice which has been done to many of\nthe best friends of the farm and garden, says:\n\n\"The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day to\ndestroy the enemies of the husbandman, are persecuted unceasingly.This\nhas especially been the case with the Hawk family, only three of the\ncommon inland species being harmful.These are the Goshawk, Cooper's\nHawk, and the Sharp-shinned Hawk, the first of which is rare in the\nUnited States, except in winter.Cooper's Hawk, or the Chicken Hawk,\nis the most destructive, especially to Doves.The other Hawks are of\ngreat value, one of which, the Marsh Hawk, being regarded as perhaps\nmore useful than any other.It can be easily distinguished by its\nwhite rump and its habit of beating low over the meadows.Meadow Mice,\nRabbits, and Squirrels are its favorite food.The Red-tailed Hawk, or\nHen Hawk, is another.\"It does not deserve the name, for according to\nDr.Fisher, while fully sixty-six per cent of its food consists of\ninjurious mammals, not more than seven per cent consists of poultry,\nand that it is probable that a large proportion of the poultry and game\ncaptured by it and the other Buzzard Hawks is made up of old, diseased,\nor otherwise disabled fowls, so preventing their interbreeding with the\nsound stock and hindering the spread of fatal epidemics.It eats Ground\nSquirrels, Rabbits, Mice, and Rats.The Red-shouldered Hawk, whose picture we present to our readers, is\nas useful as it is beautiful, in fact ninety per cent of its food is\ncomposed of injurious mammals and insects.The Sparrow Hawk (See BIRDS, vol.107) is another useful member\nof this family.In the warm months Grasshoppers, Crickets, and other\ninsects compose its food, and Mice during the rest of the year.Swainson's Hawk is said to be the great Grasshopper destroyer of the\nwest, and it is estimated that in a month three hundred of these birds\nsave sixty tons of produce that the Grasshopper would destroy.On account of the value of its skin, this interesting animal is much\nsought after by those who take pride in their skill in securing it.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.It is commonly known by its abbreviated name of <DW53>, and as it is of\nfrequent occurrence throughout the United States, every country boy is\nmore or less acquainted with its habits.As an article of food there is\nmuch diversity of opinion respecting its merits.It is hunted by some\nfor the sport alone, which is doubtless to be lamented, and by others\nwho enjoy also the pleasure of a palatable stew.As a pet it is also\nmuch prized.The food of the Raccoon consists in the main of small animals and\ninsects.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.The succulent Oyster also is a favorite article of its diet.It bites off the hinge of the Oyster and scrapes out the animal in\nfragments with its paws.Like the Squirrel when eating a nut, the\nRaccoon usually holds its food between its fore paws pressed together\nand sits upon its hind quarters when it eats.Poultry is also enjoyed\nby it, and it is said to be as destructive in the farm yard as the Fox,\nas it only devours the heads of the fowl.When taken young the <DW53> is easily tamed, but often becomes blind soon\nafter its capture.This is believed to be produced by the sensitiveness\nof its eyes, which are intended only to be used by night.As it is\nfrequently awakened by day it suffers so much from the glare of light\nthat its eyes gradually lose their vision.If it must be confined\nat all it should be in a darkened place.In zoological gardens we\nhave frequently seen several of these animals exposed to the glaring\nsunlight, the result of ignorance or cruelty, or both.Unlike the Fox, the Raccoon is at home in a tree, which is the usual\nrefuge when danger is near, and not being very swift of foot, it is\nwell that it possesses this climbing ability.According to Hallock,\nthe <DW53>s' abode is generally in a hollow tree, oak or chestnut, and\nwhen the \"juvenile farmer's son comes across a _Coon tree_, he is\nnot long in making known his discovery to friends and neighbors, who\nforthwith assemble at the spot to secure it.\"The \"sport\" is in no\nsense agreeable from a humane point of view, and we trust it will cease\nto be regarded as such by those who indulge in it.\"The Raccoon makes a\nheroic struggle and often puts many of his assailants _hors de combat_\nfor many a day, his jaws being strong and his claws sharp.\"The young ones are generally from four to eight, pretty little\ncreatures at first and about as large as half-grown Rats.They are very\nplayful, soon become docile and tame, but at the first chance will\nwander off to the woods and not return.The <DW53> is a night animal and\nnever travels by day; sometimes it is said, being caught at morning far\nfrom its tree and being unable to return thither, it will spend the\nhours of daylight snugly coiled up among the thickest foliage of some\nlofty tree-top.It is adroit in its attempts to baffle Dogs, and will\noften enter a brook and travel for some distance in the water, thus\npuzzling and delaying its pursuers.A good sized Raccoon will weigh from fifteen to twenty pounds.The curiosity of the Raccoon is one of its most interesting\ncharacteristics.It will search every place of possible concealment for\nfood, examine critically any object of interest, will rifle a pocket,\nstand upright and watch every motion of man or animal, and indeed show\na marked desire for all sorts of knowledge.Raccoons are apparently\nhappy in captivity when properly cared for by their keepers.Their Number and Variety is Increasing Instead of Diminishing.Whether in consequence of the effective working of the Wild Birds'\nCharter or of other unknown causes, there can be no doubt in the\nminds of observant lovers of our feathered friends that of late years\nthere has been a great and gratifying increase in their numbers in\nand around London, especially so, of course, in the vicinity of the\nbeautiful open spaces which do such beneficent work silently in this\nprovince of houses.But even in long, unlovely streets, far removed\nfrom the rich greenery of the parks, the shabby parallelograms, by\ncourtesy styled gardens, are becoming more and more frequently visited\nby such pretty shy songsters as Linnets, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and\nFinches, who, though all too often falling victims to the predatory\nCat, find abundant food in these cramped enclosures.Naturally some\nsuburbs are more favored than others in this respect, notably Dulwich,\nwhich, though fast losing its beautiful character under the ruthless\ngrip of the builder, still retains some delightful nooks where one may\noccasionally hear the Nightingale's lovely song in its season.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.But the most noticable additions to the bird population of London have\nbeen among the Starlings.Their quaint gabble and peculiar minor\nwhistle may now be heard in the most unexpected localities.Even\nthe towering mansions which have replaced so many of the slums of\nWestminster find favor in their eyes, for among the thick clustering\nchimneys which crown these great buildings their slovenly nests may be\nfound in large numbers.In some districts they are so numerous that the\nirrepressible Sparrow, true London gamin that he is, finds himself in\nconsiderable danger of being crowded out.This is perhaps most evident\non the sequestered lawns of some of the inns of the court, Gray's Inn\nSquare, for instance, where hundreds of Starlings at a time may now\nbe observed busily trotting about the greensward searching for food.Several long streets come to mind where not a house is without its pair\nor more of Starlings, who continue faithful to their chosen roofs, and\nwhose descendants settle near as they grow up, well content with their\nsurroundings.House Martins, too, in spite of repeated efforts on the\npart of irritated landlords to drive them away by destroying their\nnests on account of the disfigurement to the front of the dwelling,\npersist in returning year after year and rebuilding their ingenious\nlittle mud cells under the eaves of the most modern suburban villas or\nterrace houses.--_Pall Mall Gazette._\n\n\n\n\n  [Illustration: From col.The Pigmy Antelopes present examples of singular members of the family,\nin that they are of exceedingly diminutive size, the smallest being\nno larger than a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.The Pigmy is an\ninhabitant of South Africa, and its habits are said to be quite similar\nto those of its brother of the western portion of North America.The Antelope is a very wary animal, but the sentiment of curiosity\nis implanted so strongly in its nature that it often leads it to\nreconnoitre too closely some object which it cannot clearly make out,\nand its investigations are pursued until \"the dire answer to all\ninquiries is given by the sharp'spang' of the rifle and the answering\n'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful creatures flank.\"The Pigmy\nAntelope is not hunted, however, as is its larger congener, and may\nbe considered rather as a diminutive curiosity of Natures' delicate\nworkmanship than as the legitimate prey of man.No sooner had the twilight settled over the island than new bird voices\ncalled from the hills about us.The birds of the day were at rest, and\ntheir place was filled with the night denizens of the island.They\ncame from the dark recesses of the forests, first single stragglers,\nincreased by midnight to a stream of eager birds, passing to and fro\nfrom the sea.Many, attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered\ntheir course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the\nCassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds\nalighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching\ninto the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,\ndaylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured\nduring the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was\nafter birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of\nthese night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being\nfairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the milk.The larger tunnels\nof the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,\nwhile the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the\nflat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with\nmany turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were\ninvariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this\nspecies, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,\nboth sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above\nthe surf.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand\ninto their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at home, its\nvise-like bill can inflict a very painful wound.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.The rookeries of the\nMurres and Cormorants were on the sides of steep cliffs overhanging the\nsea.Looking down from above, hundreds of eggs could be seen, gathered\nalong the narrow shelves and chinks in the rocks, but accessible only\nby means of a rope from the top.--_Outing._\n\n\n\n\nTHE RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Blue Jay\nimitated, as you will remember, in the story \"The New Tenants,\"\npublished in Birds._Kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, that is my cry, very loud and plaintive;\nthey say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve\neither of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what\na lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop\ndown into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off\na Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than\nChickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird\nonce in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am\nhungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the\nbarnyard.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve\nthe name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber\nare the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old\ncrow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in\na soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When\nwe build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,\nlined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady\nRed-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old\nlady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on\nhe rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go\nto his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually\nsucceed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid\nof them, oh no!<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the apple.We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,\nwho harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to\nrout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him\nto the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently\nfollows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little\nassailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,\nas well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to\nknow it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits\nthe woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,\nMoles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or\nBob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the\ntimber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its\nnatural haunts.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might\ndestroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from\nthe perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long\ntime without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho\nFalls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this\nspecies from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine\ndays after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and\nhe allowed them to hatch and rear their young.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.One winter during his\nabsence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,\nor cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found\nthem building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time\nin a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that\nthey become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which\nthey vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within\ntheir limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being\nespecially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of\nWinter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though\nit does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or\nfour--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white\nor brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades\nof reddish brown.According to\nDavie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the\nvariation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this\nmust be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species\nvary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong\nwith a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the\nair, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of\nthe wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,\nwhile thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,\nthat, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous\ncuriosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.Its\nDoves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to\nevery lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that\nthey fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless\nnumbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found\non the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but\nas a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,\nhowever, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as\nlarge, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.Their plumage\nis of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally\none of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a\nhandful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand\nor shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed\na pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when\nthey are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of\nSan Marco.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one\nintentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will\ncrowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until\nyou can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread\nfor their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who\nmust certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger\nmakes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they\nwill collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,\nand in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are\nfound perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally\nwe will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never\nappear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell\ntower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite\nroosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a\nforeigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of\nwhich attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and\nthe extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which\nstruck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:\n\nCenturies ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,\nand army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called\nDoges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic\nand cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as\na port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as\na consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather\nindifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by\none and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they\nstood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during\none of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city\nhad been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming\nto such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of\nlack of food.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow\nthe city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups\non the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,\nwhen lo!in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon\nthe city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned\nsupreme, and men asked each other: \"What new calamity is this?\"As the\ncloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,\nwhich, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully\nsettled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, \"The Doves!It\nappears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times\nfor Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,\nthere would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace\nand happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of\nattacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet\nalso stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity\nwould reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves\nwould leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into\noblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it\nwas told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,\nbut they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of\nVenice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San\nMarco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous\nDoges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the\npalace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What\na boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the\ndoomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now\ndeserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by\nthe inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San\nMarco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that\nthey may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._\n\n\n\n\nBUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,\nthat \"the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,\ncreeping caterpillars\" should be almost as numerous in October as in\nthe balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some\nparts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year\nfor the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not\nquite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect\ncondition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and\nremain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,\ndoes not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly\nwith us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these\ndelicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of\nthe mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current\nLiterature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,\nand they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines\nas the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky\nmotions.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the\nground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders\ntheir identification easy.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.They are seen at their best in August and\nSeptember.All June and July Butterflies are August and September\nButterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still\nplentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal\nfoliage.The \"little wood brownies,\" or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the milk there.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and\nretirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over\nthe shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but\nthey are far more numerous and perfect in July, August, and September.A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when it is fluttering over flowers\nin the sunshine, looks like a tiny speck of bright blue satin.Several\nother small Butterflies which appear at the same time are readily\ndistinguished by the peculiar manner in which their hind wings are\ntailed.Their color is a dull brown of various shades, marked in some\nof the varieties with specks of white or blue.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.\"Their presence in the gardens and meadows,\" says a recent writer,\n\"and in the fields and along the river-banks, adds another element\nof gladness which we are quick to recognize, and even the plodding\nwayfarer who has not the honor of a single intimate acquaintance among\nthem might, perhaps, be the first to miss their circlings about his\npath.As roses belong to June, and chrysanthemums to November, so\nButterflies seem to be a joyous part of July.It is their gala-day,\nand they are everywhere, darting and circling and sailing, dropping to\ninvestigate flowers and overripe fruit, and rising on buoyant wings\nhigh into the upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.But July can\nonly claim the larger part of their allegiance, for they are wanderers\ninto all the other months, and even occasionally brave the winter with\ntorn and faded wings.\"[Illustration: BUTTERFLIES.--Life-size.Somehow people always say that when they see a Fox.I'd rather they\nwould call me that than stupid, however.\"Look pleasant,\" said the man when taking my photograph for Birds,\nand I flatter myself I did--and intelligent, too.Look at my brainy\nhead, my delicate ears--broad below to catch every sound, and tapering\nso sharply to a point that they can shape themselves to every wave\nof sound.Note the crafty calculation and foresight of my low, flat\nbrow, the resolute purpose of my pointed nose; my eye deep set--like\na robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You\ncouldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the\ndead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for\na Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I\ndidn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest\nstream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout\nin the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing\nby his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the\nwater and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes\nto be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap\ngo my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,\nthe ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up\ntheir long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the\nhillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop\nand fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,\nand other Birds.For dessert I have\nonly to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and\ngrapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.They grow fat\nand saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of\ntraps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.The Gray Fox is a more\nsouthern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state\nof Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,\naccording to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in\nthis country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does\nthat proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and\nthe smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and\ndiffers from him in being wholly dark gray \"mixed hoary and black.\"He\nalso differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will\noften ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect\none, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the\nFox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels\nvery much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,\nhowever, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the\nscent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil\nof a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or\nfive cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers\nthey assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very\nlikely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.An amusing incident,\nhe relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will\nbear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by\nmeans of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had\nbeen making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the\nneighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that\naccount.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,\nand accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The\nhole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious\nand continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and\nRep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had\nwaxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous\nmelee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his\nhoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the\nmaze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement\nof the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who\nwith a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding\nhead, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of\nthe turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid\naside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over\nthe crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,\nwill soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers\nof very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular\nruns, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and\nthe use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw\noff the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support\ntheir ancient reputation for cunning.RURAL BIRD LIFE IN INDIA.--\"Nothing gives more delight,\" writes Mr.Caine, \"in traveling", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Yellow-beaked Minas,\nRing-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry\nPalm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out\nof the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is\nalive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every\nsize and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up\nto the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a\ndead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and\npresently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in\ncharge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through\nthe surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers\nflash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight.\"----\n\nWARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory\nof warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have\nbeen made in India by Mr.He concludes\nthat there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous\nbirds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that\nmany, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate\nin comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and\nthree other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most\ndistasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with\nbad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.He also\nexperimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate\nthe nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----\n\nINCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The\nestablishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led\nto the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United\nStates.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000\nacres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,\n200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild\nBoar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a\npreserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,\nMuledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.\nC. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near\nLenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves\nare Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,\nnear Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,\nWashington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;\nand Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----\n\nROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous\nas during 1898.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the\nground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding\ntogether, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in\nflocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few\nbirds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost\neverywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is\ntimber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very\nabundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without\nunusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or\nyellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this\ncolor through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels\nare often found associating together.They are said to be in every\nrespect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every\ndetail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as\ndistinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,\nan anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct\nexplanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning\njust after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their\nhole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when\nthey again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter\nlies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and\nchattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless\non a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the\nslightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.This fact is\ntaken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he\nat all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular\nlocality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black\nSquirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have\nseveral young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very\nremarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast\nand other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the\nNiagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed\nto hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The\ncurrent is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally\nventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,\nsucceeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the\npoint of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them\nto be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a\nboy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel\ninto deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The\n\"sport\" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a\nrebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any\nhousehold tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless\nenmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is\nwilling to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with\nthem, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to\nexterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and\nwas rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white\nRabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before\nbeen molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field\nsomething of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to\nsee examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,\n    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,\n      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,\n      I only meant to give him a scare,\n      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--\n      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see\n      He never would sing for you or me\n      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,\n      Never more in the sunshine bright,\n      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,\n      How never, never, I can repay\n      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works\non ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most\ncurious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South\nAmerica, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent\noccurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges\nof shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.The birds move\nin flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking\nand probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,\ninsects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; \"but at the\nreport of a gun,\" says Col.Goss, \"or any sudden fright, spring into\nthe air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying\nswift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted\noften circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally\na timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,\nsometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground.\"Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until\nrecently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon\n\"Natural History Collections in Alaska,\" we quote as follows: \"The\nnight of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised\nflap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as\ncan be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become\nindistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and\nsent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and\nto the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND\nALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more\ndistinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my\nposition, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,\nand again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The\nopen flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living\ncreature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance\nrevealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards\nfrom me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of\nthe bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded\nopportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under\na variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the\nlight Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the\nsame time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of\nthe syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_.\"The bird\nmay frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,\nits enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,\nand that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for\nhigh and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a\ndepression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are\nfour, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Why was the sight\n    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,\n    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,\n    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;\n    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON.\"But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited.\"The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration\nare capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,\nthe mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of\nthought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges\nin power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light\nand darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects\nof various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a\n mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the\nlight which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist\nnot far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was\nonce merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action\nof light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the\nleast complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the\nfront of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain\nsubstances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to\ncontinued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina\nhas apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a\nfly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical\nor all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving\nthat heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along\nthe line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium\nthe presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that\ncertain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly\nby the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat\nwaves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light\nand heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he\nbrought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed\ndirectly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his\neye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,\nbut when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the\nconvergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy\nwhich his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving\nplate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick\nadjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the\neye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely\nfrom lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and\nshort range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings\nnoiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the\nmore the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few\ninches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious\nfeature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long\nrange in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading\nand someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,\nthe eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when\nwe return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed\nin the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in\nbeautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully\nand all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors\nwithin a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend\nto the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the\nfind may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater\ndistances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when\nthe carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds\nof these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's\neyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and\ncontraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness\nof enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact\nthat he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid\ncalled the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the\neye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery\nthat the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of\npeculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is\nclosed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl\nis occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent\nmembrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are\nequipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled\nin my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of\nhis head.On the side which\nglides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and\nSole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely\ndistinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,\nwhile the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor\none side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most\nvertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in\nexploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away\nfrom the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones\nof the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the\napparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular\nproduct of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a\ncurious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost\ndestitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like\nthat of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used\nwith good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying\npower.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,\nthey have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies\ntears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of\nCetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in\nthe eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long\nvertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many\nother grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.These are not movable, but\nthe evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in\nwhatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has\nfifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and\nso arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of\nthe industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with\ngreat rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which\ncalls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly\nis supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all\nis the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with\ntwenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood\n      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food\n      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking\n      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;\n    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys\n    To share with him come with so great a noise\n    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,\n    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,\n    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;\n    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes\n    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;\n    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado\n    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;\n    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;\n    Another cries behind for being last;\n    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa\n    The little fool with no small sport they follow,\n    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray\n    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,\n                                                _Old English Poet_.=AMERICAN

on the stoop in\nfront of the house.While he was sitting there, little Hellena, with whom he had been a\nfavorite, having often seen him at her father's store, came running\nout to him with a large piece of cake in her hand, saying:\n\n\"Here, No-No, Hellena will give you some cake.\"No-No was the name by which the Indian was known to the child, having\nlearned it from hearing the Indian make use of the name no, no, so\noften when trading with her father.The Indian took the proffered cake with a smile, and as he did so\nlifted the child up in his arms and gazed at her steadily for a few\nmoments, as if he wished to impress every feature upon his memory, and\nthen sat her down again.He was just in the act of doing this when the child's father came out\nof the dining-room.Rosenthrall, imagining that the Indian was about to kidnap his\ndaughter, or do her some violence, rushed out ordering him to put the\nchild down, and be off about his business.It was the recollection of this circumstance, taken in connection with\nthe fact that Fire Cloud had been seen in the city on the day on which\nhis daughter had disappeared, which led Rosenthrall to fix upon the\nold chief as the person who had carried off Hellena.This opinion, as we have seen, was encouraged by Captain Flint for\nreasons of his own.Rosenthrall, as Captain Flint had said, although for a long time one\nof his best customers, knowing to, and winking at his unlawful doings,\nhaving been elected a magistrate took it in to his head to be honest.He had made money out of his connection with the smuggler and pirate,\nand he probably thought it best to break off the connection before it\nshould be too late, and he should be involved in the ruin which he\nforesaw Captain Flint was certain to bring upon himself if he\ncontinued much longer in the reckless course he was now pursuing.All this was understood by Captain Flint, and it was as he explained\nto his men, in order to get the upper hand of Rosenthrall, and thus\nprevent the danger which threatened him from that quarter, he had\ncaused Hellena to be kidnapped, and conveyed to their grand hiding\nplace, the cave in the side of the mountain.Rosenthrall at this time resided in a cottage on the banks of the\nriver, a short distance from his place of business, the grounds\nsloping down to the water.These grounds were laid out into a flower garden where there was an\narbor in which Hellena spent the greater part of her time during the\nwarm summer evenings.It was while lingering in this arbor rather later than usual that she\nwas suddenly pounced upon by the two Indians employed by Captain Flint\nfor the purpose, and conveyed to his vessel, which lay at anchor a\nshort distance further up the river.Captain Flint immediately set sail with his unwilling passenger, and\nin a few hours afterwards she was placed in the cave under the safe\nkeeping of the squaw who presided over that establishment.If the reader would like to know what kind of a looking girl Hellena\nRosenthrall was at this time, I would say that a merrier, more\nanimated, if not a handsomer face he never looked upon.She was the\nvery picture of health and fine spirits.Her figure was rather slight, but not spare, for her form was compact\nand well rounded, and her movements were as light and elastic as those\nof a deer.Her complexion was fair, one in which you might say without any streak\nof fancy, the lily was blended with the rose.Her eyes were blue and her hair auburn, bordering on the golden, and\nslightly inclined to wave rather than to curl.Her nose was of moderate size and straight, or nearly so.Some would say that her mouth was rather large, but the lips were so\nbeautifully shaped, and then when she smiled she displayed such an\nexquisite set of the purest teeth, setting off to such advantage the\nruby tinting of the lips, you felt no disposition to find fault with\nit.We have spoken of Hellena's look as being one of animation and high\nspirits, and such was its general character, but for some time past a\nshadow of gloom had come over it.Hellena was subject to the same frailties which are common to her sex.The object of her affections was a young man some two or three years\nolder than herself, and at first nothing occurred to mar their\nhappiness, for the parents of both were in favor of the match.As they were both young, however, it was decided to postpone their\nunion for a year.In the meantime, Henry Billings, the intended bridegroom, should make\na voyage to Europe in order to transact some business for his father,\nwho was a merchant trading with Amsterdam.The vessel in which he sailed never reached her place of destination.It was known that she carried out a large amount of money sent by\nmerchants in New York, as remittances to those with whom they had\ndealings in Europe.This, together with certain facts which transpired\nshortly after the departure of the vessel, led some people to suspect\nthat she had met with foul play somewhere on the high seas; and that\nnot very far from port either.Hellena, who happened to be in her father's store one day when Captain\nFlint was there, saw on his finger a plain gold ring which she was\nsure had belonged to her lover.This fact she mentioned to her father after the captain had gone.Her father at that time ridiculed her suspicions.But he afterwards\nremembered circumstances connected with the departure of the vessel,\nand the movements of Captain Flint about the same time, which taken in\nconnection with the discovery made by his daughter, did seem to\njustify the dark suspicions created in the mind of his daughter.But how was he to act under the circumstance?As a magistrate, it was\nhis business to investigate the matter.But then there was the danger\nshould he attempt to do so, of exposing his own connection with the\npirate.And he did move cautiously, yet not so cautiously but he aroused the\nsuspicions of Captain Flint, who, as we have seen, in order to secure\nhimself against the danger which threatened him in that quarter, had\ncarried off the daughter of the merchant.When the vessel in which young Billings set sail started she had a\nfair wind, and was soon out in the open sea.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.Just as night began to set in, a small craft was observed approaching\nthem, and being a much faster sailor than the larger and heavily\nladened ship, she was soon along-side.When near enough to be heard, the commander of the smaller vessel\ndesired the other to lay too, as he had important dispatches for him\nwhich had been forgotten.The commander of the ship not liking to stop his vessel while under\nfull sail merely for the purpose of receiving dispatches, offered to\nsend for them, and was about lowering a boat for that purpose, when\nthe other captain, who was none other than Captain Flint, declared\nthat he could only deliver them in person.The captain of the ship, though in no very good humor, finally\nconsented to lay too, and the two vessels were soon lying along side\nof each other.Now although while lying at, or about the wharves of New York, the two\nmen already introduced to the reader apparently constituted the whole\ncrew of Captain Flint's vessel, such was by no means the fact, for\nthere were times when the deck of the little craft would seem fairly\nto swarm with stout, able-bodied fellows.And the present instance,\nCaptain Flint had no sooner set foot upon the deck of the ship, than\nsix or eight men fully armed appeared on the deck of the schooner\nprepared to follow him.The first thing that Captain Flint did on reaching the deck of the\nship was to strike the captain down with a blow from the butt of a\nlarge pistol he held in his hand.His men were soon at his side, and\nas the crew of the other vessel were unarmed, although defending\nthemselves as well as they could, they were soon overpowered.Several of them were killed on the spot, and those who were not killed\noutright, were only reserved for a more cruel fate.The fight being over, the next thing was to secure the treasure.This was a task of but little difficulty, for Flint had succeeded in\ngetting one of his men shipped as steward on the ill-fated vessel.One of those who had escaped the massacre was James Bradley.He had,\nby order of Captain Flint, been lashed to the mast at the commencement\nof the fight.All the others who were not killed were\nmore or less badly hurt.These were unceremoniously compelled to walk the plank, and were\ndrowned.When it came to Billings' turn, there seemed to be some hesitation\namong the pirates subjecting him to the same fate as the others.Jones Bradley, in a particular manner, was for sparing his life on\ncondition that he would pledge himself to leave the country, never to\nreturn, and bind himself to eternal secrecy.But this advice was overruled by Captain Flint himself, who declared\nhe would trust no one, and that the young man should walk the plank as\nthe others had done.From this decision there was no appeal, and Henry Billings resigned\nhimself to his fate.Before going he said he would, as a slight favor, to ask of one of his\ncaptors.And then pulling a plain gold ring off his finger, he said:\n\n\"It is only to convey this to the daughter of Carl Rosenthrall, if he\ncan find means of doing so, without exposing himself to danger.I can\nhardly wish her to be made acquainted with my fate.\"When he had finished, Captain Flint stepped up saying that he would\nundertake to perform the office, and taking the ring he placed it upon\nhis own finger.With a firm tread Billings stepped upon the\nplank, and the next moment was floundering in the sea.The next thing for the pirates to do was to scuttle the ship, which\nthey did after helping themselves to so much of the most valuable\nportion of the cargo as they thought they could safely carry away with\nthem.In about an hour afterwards the ship sank, bearing down with her the\nbodies of her murdered crew, and burying, as Captain Flint supposed,\nin the depths of the ocean all evidences of the fearful tragedy which\nhad been enacted upon her deck.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.The captain now directed his course homeward, and the next day the\nlittle vessel was lying in port as if nothing unusual had happened,\nCaptain Flint pretending that he had returned from one of his usual\ntrading voyages along the coast.The intercourse between the new and the old world was not so frequent\nin those days as now.The voyages, too, were much longer than at\npresent.So that, although a considerable time passed, bringing no\ntidings of the ill-fated vessel without causing any uneasiness.But when week after week rolled by, and month followed month, and\nstill nothing was heard from her, the friends of those on board began\nto be anxious about their fate.At length a vessel which had sailed some days later than the missing\nship, had reported that nothing had been heard from her.The only hope now was that she might have been obliged by stress of\nweather to put in to some other port.But after awhile this hope also was abandoned, and all were\nreluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion that she had foundered\nat sea, and that all on board had perished.After lying a short time in port, Captain Flint set sail up the river\nunder pretence of going on a trading expedition among the various\nIndian tribes.But he ascended the river no further than the Highlands, and come to\nanchor along the mountain familiarly known as Butterhill, but which\npeople of more romantic turn call Mount Tecomthe, in honor of the\nfamous Indian chief of that name.Having secured their vessel close to the shore, the buccaneers now\nlanded, all save one", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Each carried with him a bundle or package containing a portion of the\nmost valuable part of the plunder taken from the ship which they had\nso recently robbed.Having ascended the side of the mountain for about two hundred yards,\nthey came to what seemed to be a simple fissure in the rocks about\nwide enough to admit two men abreast.This cleft or fissure they entered, and having proceeded ten or\nfifteen feet they came to what appeared to be a deep well or pit.Here the party halted, and Captain Flint lighted a torch, and\nproducing a light ladder, which was concealed in the bushes close by,\nthe whole party descended.On reaching the bottom of the pit, a low, irregular opening was seen\nin the side, running horizontally into the mountain.This passage they entered, Indian file, and bending almost double.As they proceeded the opening widened and grew higher, until it\nexpanded into a rude chamber about twelve feet one way by fifteen feet\nthe other.Here, as far as could be seen, was a bar to all further progress, for\nthe walls of the chamber appeared to be shut in on every side.But on reaching the further side of the apartment, they stopped at a\nrough slab of stone, which apparently formed a portion of the floor of\nthe cave.Upon one of the men pressing on one end of the slab, the other rose\nlike a trap door, disclosing an opening in the floor amply sufficient\nto admit one person, and by the light of the torch might be seen a\nrude flight of rocky stairs, descending they could not tell how far.These were no doubt in part at least artificial.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.The slab also had been placed over the hole by the pirates, or by some\nothers like them who had occupied the cave before this time, by way of\nsecurity, and to prevent surprise.Captain Flint descended these steps followed by his men.About twenty steps brought them to the bottom, when they entered\nanother horizontal passage, and which suddenly expanded into a wide\nand lofty chamber.Here the party halted, and the captain shouted at the top of his\nvoice:\n\n\"What ho!there, Lightfoot, you she devil, why don't you light up!\"This rude summons was repeated several times before it received any\nanswer.At length an answer came in what was evidently a female voice, and\nfrom one who was in no very good humor: \"Oh, don't you get into a\npassion now.How you s'pose I know you was coming back so soon.\"\"Didn't I tell you I'd be back to-day!\"\"Well, what if you did,\" replied the voice.\"Do you always come when\nyou says you will?\"\"Well, no matter, let's have no more of your impudence.We're back\nbow, and I want you to light up and make a fire.\"The person addressed was now heard retiring and muttering to herself.In a few moments the hall was a blaze of light from lamps placed in\nalmost every place where a lamp could be made to stand.The scene that burst upon the sight was one of enchantment.The walls and ceiling of the cavern seemed to be covered with a\nfrosting of diamonds, multiplying the lamps a thousand fold, and\nadding to them all the colors of the rainbow.Some of the crystals which were of the purest quartz hanging from the\nroof, were of an enormous size, giving reflections which made the\nbrilliancy perfectly bewildering.The floor of the cavern was covered, not with Brussels or Wilton\ncarpets, but with the skins of the deer and bear, which to the tread\nwere as pleasant as the softest velvet.Around the room were a number of frames, rudely constructed to be\nsure, of branches, but none the less convenient on that account, over\nwhich skins were stretched, forming comfortable couches where the men\nmight sleep or doze away their time when not actively employed.Near the center of the room was a large flat stone rising about two\nfeet above the floor.The top of this stone had been made perfectly\nlevel, and over it a rich damask cloth had been spread so as to make\nit answer all the purposes of a table.Boxes covered with skins, and\npackages of merchandise answered the purpose of chairs, when chairs\nwere wanted.\"Where is the king, I should like to know?\"said Captain Flint,\nlooking with pride around the cavern now fully lighted up; \"who can\nshow a hall in his palace that will compare with this?\"\"And where is the king that is half so independent as we are?\"\"And kings we are,\" said Captain Flint; \"didn't they call the\nBuccaneers Sea Kings in the olden time?\"\"But this talking isn't getting our supper ready.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.Where has that\nIndian she-devil taken herself off again?\"The person here so coarsely alluded to, now made her appearance again,\nbearing a basket containing a number of bottles, decanters and\ndrinking glasses.She was not, to be sure, so very beautiful, but by no means so ugly as\nto deserve the epithet applied to her by Captain Flint.She was an Indian woman, apparently thirty, or thirty-five years of\nage, of good figure and sprightly in her movements, which circumstance\nhad probable gained for her among her own people, the name of\nLightfoot.She had once saved Captain Flint's life when a prisoner among the\nIndians, and fearing to return to her people, she had fled with him.It was while flying in company with this Indian woman, that Captain\nFlint had accidently discovered this cave.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.And here the fugitives had\nconcealed themselves for several days, until the danger which then\nthreatened them had passed.It was on this occasion that it occurred to the captain, what a place\nof rendezvous this cave would be for himself and his gang; what a\nplace of shelter in case of danger; what a fine storehouse for the\nplunder obtained in his piratical expeditions!He immediately set about fixing it up for the purpose; and as it would\nbe necessary to have some one to take charge of things in his absence,\nhe thought of none whom he could more safely trust with the service,\nthan the Indian woman who had shared his flight.From that time, the cave became a den of pirates, as it had probably\nat one time been a den of wild beasts.Which was the better condition, we leave it for the reader to decide.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.The only other occupant of the cave was a <DW64> boy of about fourteen\nor fifteen years of age, known by the name of Black Bill.He seemed to be a simple, half-witted, harmless fellow, and assisted\nLightfoot in doing the drudgery about the place.\"What have you got in your basket, Lightfoot?\"\"Away with your wine,\" said the captain; \"we must have something\nstronger than that.Give us some brandy; some fire-water.\"In de kitchen fixin' de fire,\" said Lightfoot.\"All right, let him heat some water,\" said the captain; \"and now,\nboys, we'll make a night of it,\" he said, turning to his men.The place here spoken of by Lightfoot as the kitchen, was a recess of\nseveral feet in the side of the cave, at the back of which was a\ncrevice or fissure in the rock, extending to the outside of the\nmountain.This crevice formed a natural chimney through which the smoke could\nescape from the fire that was kindled under it.The water was soon heated, the table was covered with bottles,\ndecanters and glasses of the costliest manufacture.Cold meats of\ndifferent kinds, and an infinite variety of fruits were produced, and\nthe feasting commenced.Yes, the pirate and his crew were now seated round the table for the\npurpose as he said, of making a night of it.And a set of more perfect\ndevils could hardly be found upon the face of the earth.And yet there was nothing about them so far as outward appearance was\nconcerned, that would lead you to suppose them to be the horrible\nwretches that they really were.With the exception of Jones Bradley, there was not one among them who\nhad not been guilty of almost every crime to be found on the calender\nof human depravity.For some time very little was said by any of the party, but after a\nwhile as their blood warmed under the influence of the hot liquor,\ntheir tongues loosened, and they became more talkative.And to hear\nthem, you would think that a worthier set of men were no where to be\nfound.Not that they pretended to any extraordinary degree of virtue, but\nthen they had as much as anyone else.And he who pretended to any\nmore, was either a hypocrite or a fool.To be sure, they robbed, and murdered, and so did every one else, or\nwould if they found it to their interest to do so.Tim,\" shouted one of the men to another who sat at the\nopposite side of the table; \"where is that new song that you learned\nthe other day?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.\"I've got it here,\" replied the person referred to, putting his finger\non his forehead.\"Let's have it,\" said the other.The request being backed by the others Tim complied as follows.Fill up the bowl,\n    Through heart and soul,\n        Let the red wine circle free,\n    Here's health and cheer,\n    To the Buccaneer,\n        The monarch of the sea!The king may pride,\n    In his empire wide,\n        A robber like us is he,\n    With iron hand,\n    He robs on land,\n        As we rob on the sea.The priest in his gown,\n    Upon us may frown,\n        The merchant our foe may be,\n    Let the judge in his wig,\n    And the lawyer look big,\n        They're robbers as well as we!Then fill up the bowl,\n    Through heart and through soul,\n        Let the red wine circle free,\n    Drink health and cheer,\n    To the Buccaneer.\"I like that song,\" said one of the men, whose long sober face and\nsolemn, drawling voice had gained for him among his companions the\ntitle of Parson.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.\"I like that song; it has the ring of the true metal,\nand speaks my sentiments exactly.It's as good as a sermon, and better\nthan some sermons I've heard.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\"It preaches the doctrine I've always preached, and that is that the\nwhole world is filled with creatures who live by preying upon each\nother, and of all the animals that infest the earth, man is the worst\nand cruelest.\"said one of the men, \"you don't mean to say that the\nwhole world's nothing but a set of thieves and murderers!\"\"Yes; I do,\" said the parson; \"or something just as bad.\"\"I'd like to know how you make that out,\" put in Jones Bradley.\"I had\na good old mother once, and a father now dead and gone.I own I'm bad\nenough myself, but no argument of yours parson, or any body else's can\nmake me believe that they were thieves and murderers.\"\"I don't mean to be personal,\" said the parson, \"your father and\nmother may have been angels for all I know, but I'll undertake to show\nthat all the rest of the world, lawyers, doctors and all, are a set of\nthieves and murderers, or something just as bad.\"\"Well Parson, s'pose you put the stopper on there,\" shouted one of the\nmen; \"if you can sing a song, or spin a yarn, it's all right; but this\nain't a church, and we don't want to listen to one of your long-winded\nsermons tonight.\"The Parson thus rebuked, was fain to hold his peace for the rest of\nthe evening.After a pause of a few moments, one of the men reminded Captain Flint,\nthat he had promised to inform them how he came to adopt their\nhonorable calling as a profession.\"Well,\" said the captain, \"I suppose I might as well do it now, as at\nany other time; and if no one else has anything better to offer, I'll\ncommence; and to begin at the beginning, I was born in London.About\nmy schooling and bringing up, I haven't much to say, as an account of\nit would only be a bore.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.\"My father was a merchant and although I suppose one ought not to\nspeak disrespectfully of one's father, he was, I must say, as\ngripping, and tight-fisted a man as ever walked the earth.\"I once heard a man say, he would part with anything he had on earth\nfor money, but his wife.My father, I believe, would have not only\nparted with his wife and children for money, but himself too, if he\nhad thought he should profit by the bargain.\"As might be expected, the first thing he tried to impress on the\nminds of his children was the necessity of getting money.\"To be sure, he did not tell us to steal, as the word is generally\nunderstood; for he wanted us to keep clear of the clutches of the law.Could we only succeed in doing this, it mattered little to him, how\nthe desired object was secured.\"He found in me an easy convert to his doctrine, so far as the getting\nof money was concerned; but in the propriety of hoarding the money as\nhe did when it was obtained, I had no faith.\"The best use I thought that money could be put too, was to spend it.\"Here my father and I were at swords' points, and had it not been that\nnotwithstanding this failing, as he called it, I had become useful to\nhim in his business, he would have banished me long before I took into\nmy head to be beforehand with him, and become a voluntary exile from\nthe parental roof.As I have intimated, according to my father's\nnotions all the wealth in the world was common property, and every one\nwas entitled to all he could lay his hands on.\"Now, believing in this doctrine, it occurred to me that my father had\nmore money than he could ever possibly make use of, and that if I\ncould possess a portion of it without exposing myself to any great\ndanger, I should only be carrying out his own doctrine.\"Acting upon this thought, I set about helping myself as opportunity\noffered, sometimes by false entries, and in various ways that I need\nnot explain.\"This game I carried on for some time, but I knew that it would not\nlast forever.I should be found out at last, and I must be out of the\nway before the crash came.\"Luckily a chance of escape presented itself.\"My father, in connection with two or three other merchants, chartered\na vessel to trade among the West India islands.I should now be out of\nthe way when the discovery of the frauds which I had been practicing I\nknew must be made.\"As I had no intention of ever returning, my mind was perfectly at\nease on this score.\"We found ready sale for our cargo, and made a good thing of it.\"As I have said, when I left home, it was with the intention of never\nreturning, though what I should do while abroad I had not decided, but\nas soon as the cargo was disposed of, my mind was made up.\"I had observed on our outward passage, that our vessel, which was a\nbark of about two hundred tons burden, was a very fast sailor, and\nwith a little fitting up, could be made just the craft we wanted for\nour purpose.\"During the voyage, I had sounded the hands in regard to my intention\nof becoming a Buccaneer.I found them all ready to join me excepting\nthe first mate and the steward or cook, rather, a <DW64> whose views I\nknew too well beforehand, to consult on the matter.\"As I knew that the ordinary crew of the vessel would not be\nsufficient for our purpose, I engaged several resolute fellows to join\nus, whom I prevailed on the captain to take on board as passengers.\"When we had been about a week out at sea and all our plans were\ncompleted, we quietly made prisoners of the captain and first mate,\nput them in the jolly boat with provisions to last them for several\ndays, and sent them adrift.The cook, with his son, a little boy,\nwould have gone with them, but thinking that they might be useful to\nus, we concluded to keep them on board.\"What became of the captain and mate afterwards, we never heard.\"We now put in to port on one of the islands where we knew we could do\nit in safety, and fitted our vessel up for the purpose we intended to\nuse her.\"This was soon done, and we commenced operations.\"The game was abundant, and our success far exceeded our most sanguine\nexpectations.\"There would be no use undertaking to tell the number of vessels,\nFrench, English, Spanish and Dutch, that we captured and sunk, or of\nthe poor devils we sent to a watery grave.\"But luck which had favored us so long, at last turned against as.\"The different governments became alarmed for the safety of their\ncommerce in the seas which we frequented, and several expeditions were\nfitted out for our special benefit.\"For a while we only laughed at all this, for we had escaped so many\ntimes, that we began to think we were under the protection of old\nNeptune himself.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.But early one morning the man on the look-out\nreported a sail a short distance to the leeward, which seemed trying\nto get away from us.\"It was a small vessel, or brig, but as the weather was rather hazy,\nher character in other respects he could not make out.\"We thought, however, that it was a small trading vessel, which having\ndiscovered us, and suspecting our character, was trying to reach port\nbefore we could overtake her.\"Acting under this impression, we made all sail for her.\"As the strange vessel did not make very great headway, an hour's\nsailing brought as near enough to give us a pretty good view of her,\nyet we could not exactly make out her character, yet we thought that\nshe had a rather suspicious look.And still she appeared rather like a\ntraveling vessel, though if so, she could not have much cargo on\nboard, and as the seemed built for speed, we wondered why she did not\nmake better headway.\"But we were not long left in doubt in regard to her real character,\nfor all at once her port-holes which had been purposely concealed were\nunmasked, and we received a broadside from her just as we were about\nto send her a messenger from our long tom.\"This broadside, although doing us little other damage, so cut our\nrigging as to render our escape now impossible if such had been our\nintention.So after returning the salute we had received, in as\nhandsome a manner as we could, I gave orders to bear down upon the\nenemy's ship, which I was glad to see had been considerably disabled\nby our shot.But as she had greatly the advantage of us in the weight\nof material, our only hope was in boarding her, and fighting it out\nhand to hand on her own deck.\"The rigging of the two vessels was soon so entangled as to make it\nimpossible to separate them.\"In spite of all the efforts of the crew of the enemy's vessel to\noppose us we were soon upon her deck.We found she was a Spanish\nbrigantine sent out purposely to capture us.\"Her apparent efforts to get away from us had been only a ruse to draw\nus on, so as to get us into a position from which there could be no\nescape.\"I have been in a good many fights, but never before one like that.\"As we expected no quarter, we gave none.The crew of the Spanish\nvessel rather outnumbered us, but not so greatly as to make the\ncontest very unequal.And in our case desperation supplied the place\nof numbers.\"The deck was soon slippery with gore, and there were but few left to\nfight on either side.The captain of the Spanish vessel was one of the\nfirst killed.Some were shot down, some were hurled over the deck in\nthe sea, some had their skulls broken with boarding pikes, and there\nwas not a man left alive of the Spanish crew; and of ours, I at first\nthought that I was the only survivor, when the <DW64> cook who had been\nforgotten all the while, came up from the cabin of our brig, bearing\nin his arms his little son, of course unharmed, but nearly frightened\nto death.Strange as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that with\nthe exception of a few slight scratches, I escaped without a wound.\"To my horror I now discovered that both vessels were fast sinking.But the cook set me at my ease on that score, by informing me that\nthere was one small boat that had not been injured.Into this we\nimmediately got, after having secured the small supply of provisions\nand water within our reach, which from the condition the vessels were,\nwas very small.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.\"We had barely got clear of the sinking vessels, when they both went\ndown, leaving us alone upon the wide ocean without compass or chart;\nnot a sail in sight, and many a long, long league from the nearest\ncoast.\"For more than a week we were tossing about on the waves without\ndiscovering a vessel.At last I saw that our provisions were nearly\ngone.We had been on short allowance from the first.At the rate they\nwere going, they would not last more than two days longer.Self preservation, they say is the first law of human nature;\nto preserve my own life, I must sacrifice my companions.The moment\nthe thought struck me it was acted upon.\"Sam, the black cook, was sitting a straddle the bow of the boat; with\na push I sent him into the sea.I was going to send his boy after him,\nbut the child clung to my legs in terror, and just at that moment a\nsail hove in sight and I changed my purpose.\"Such a groan of horror as the father gave on striking the water I\nnever heard before, and trust I shall never hear again.\"\"At that instant the whole party sprang to their feet as if started by\na shock of electricity, while most fearful groan resounded through the\ncavern, repeated by a thousand echos, each repetition growing fainter,\nand fainter until seeming to lose itself in the distance.\"That's it, that's it,\" said the captain, only louder, and if anything\nmore horrible.he demanded of Lightfoot, who had\njoined the astonished group.\"Here I is,\" said the boy crawling out from a recess in the wall in\nwhich he slept.\"No; dis is me,\" innocently replied the darkey.\"S'pose 'twas de debble comin' after massa,\" said the boy.\"What do you mean, you wooley-headed imp,\" said the captain; \"don't\nyou know that the devil likes his own color best?Away to bed, away,\nyou rascal!\"\"Well, boys,\" said Flint, addressing the men and trying to appear very\nindifferent, \"we have allowed ourselves to be alarmed by a trifle that\ncan be easily enough accounted for.\"These rocks, as you see, are full of cracks and crevices; there may\nbe other caverns under, or about as, for all we know.The wind\nentering these, has no doubt caused the noise we have beard, and which\nto our imaginations, somewhat heated by the liquor we have been\ndrinking, has converted into the terrible groan which has so startled\nus, and now that we know what it is, I may as well finish my story.\"As I was saying, a sail hove in sight.It was a vessel bound to this\nport.I and the boy were taken on board and arrived here in safety.\"This boy, whether from love or fear, I can hardly say, has clung to\nme ever since.\"I have tried to shake him off several times, but it was no use, he\nalways returns.\"The first business I engaged in on arriving here, was to trade with\nthe Indians; when having discovered this cave, it struck me that it\nwould make a fine storehouse for persons engaged in our line of\nbusiness.Acting upon this hint, I fitted it up as you see.\"With a few gold pieces which I had secured in my belt I bought our\nlittle schooner.From that time to the present, my history it as well\nknown to you as to myself.And now my long yarn is finished, let us go\non with our sport.\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.But to recall the hilarity of spirits with which the entertainment had\ncommenced, was no easy matter.Whether the captain's explanation of the strange noise was\nsatisfactory to himself or not, it was by no means so to the men.Every attempt at singing, or story telling failed.The only thing that\nseemed to meet with any favor was the hot punch, and this for the most\npart, was drank in silence.After a while they slunk away from the table one by one, and fell\nasleep in some remote corner of the cave, or rolled over where they\nsat, and were soon oblivious to everything around them.The only wakeful one among them was the captain himself, who had drank\nbut little.Could he have dozed and been\ndreaming?<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.In a more suppressed voice than before, and not repeated so many\ntimes, but the same horrid groan; he could not be mistaken, he had\nnever heard anything else like it.CHAPTER V.\n\n\nAlthough it was nearly true, as Captain Flint had told his men, that\nthey were about as well acquainted with his history since he landed in\nthis country as he was himself, such is not the case with the reader.And in order that he may be as well informed in this matter as they\nwere, we shall now endeavor to fill up the gap in the narrative.To the crew of the vessel who had rescued him and saved his life,\nCaptain Flint had represented himself as being one of the hands of a\nship which had been wrecked at sea, and from which the only ones who\nhad escaped, were himself and two <DW64>s, one of whom was the father\nof the boy who had been found with him.The father of the boy had\nfallen overboard, and been drowned just before the vessel hove in\nsight.This story, which seemed plausible enough, was believed by the men\ninto whose hands they had fallen, and Flint and the <DW64>, received\nevery attention which their forlorn condition required.And upon\narriving in port, charitable people exerted themselves in the\ncaptain's behalf, procuring him employment, and otherwise enabling him\nto procure an honest livelihood, should he so incline.But honesty was not one of the captain's virtues.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.He had not been long in the country before he determined to try his\nfortune among the Indians.He adopted this course partly because he saw in it a way of making\nmoney more rapidly than in any other, and partly because it opened to\nhim a new field of wild adventure.Having made the acquaintance of some of the Indians who were in the\nhabit of coming to the city occasionally for the purpose of trading,\nhe accompanied them to their home in the wilderness, and having\npreviously made arrangements with merchants in the city, among others\nCarl Rosenthrall, to purchase or dispose of his furs, he was soon\ndriving a thriving business.In a little while he became very popular\nwith the savages, joined one of the tribes and was made a chief.This state of things however, did not last long.The other chiefs\nbecame jealous of his influence, and incited the minds of many of the\npeople against him.They said he cheated them in his dealings, that his attachment to the\nred men was all pretence.That he was a paleface at heart, carrying on\ntrade with the palefaces to the injury of the Indians.Killing them\nwith his fire water which they gave them for their furs.In all this there was no little truth, but Flint, confident of his\npower over his new friends, paid no attention to it.One of the chiefs who had been made drunk by whiskey which he had\nreceived from Flint in exchange for a lot of beaver skins, accused the\nlatter of cheating him; called him a paleface thief who had joined the\nIndians only for the purpose of cheating them.Flint forgetting his usual caution took the unruly savage by the\nshoulders and thrust him out of the lodge.In a few moments the enraged Indian returned accompanied by another,\nwhen the two attacked the white man with knives and tomahawks.Flint saw no way but to defend himself single-handed as he was,\nagainst two infuriated savages, and to do to if possible without\nkilling either.The only weapon he had at\ncommand was a hunting knife, and he had two strong men to contend\nagainst.Fortunately for him, one of them was intoxicated.As it was, the savage who had begun the quarrel, was killed, and the\nother so badly wounded that he died a few hours afterwards.The enmity of the whole tribe was now aroused against Flint, by the\nunfortunate termination of this affair.It availed him nothing to contend that he had killed the two in self\ndefence, and that they begun the quarrel.He was a white man, and had killed two Indians, and that was enough.Besides, how did they know whether he told the truth or not?He was a paleface, and palefaces had crooked tongues, and their words\ncould not be depended upon.Besides their brethren were dead, and\ncould not speak for themselves.Finally it was decided in the grand council of the tribe that he\nshould suffer death, and although they called him a paleface, as he\nhad joined the tribe he should be treated as an Indian, and suffer\ndeath by torture in order that he might have an opportunity of showing\nhow he could endure the most horrible torment without complaining.The case of Flint now seemed to be a desperate one.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.He was bound hand\nand foot, and escape seemed out of the question.Relief came from a quarter he did not anticipate.The place where this took place was not on the borders of the great\nlakes where the tribe to which Flint had attached himself belonged,\nbut on the shores of the Hudson river a few miles above the Highlands,\nwhere a portion of the tribe had stopped to rest for a few days, while\non their way to New York, where they were going for the purpose of\ntrading.It happened that there was among them a woman who had originally\nbelonged to one of the tribes inhabiting this part of the country, but\nwho while young, had been taken prisoner in some one of the wars that\nwere always going on among the savages.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football there.She was carried away by her\ncaptors, and finally adopted into their tribe.To this woman Flint had shown some kindness, and had at several times\nmade her presents of trinkets and trifles such as he knew would\ngratify an uncultivated taste.He little thought when making these trifling presents the service he\nwas doing himself.Late in the night preceding the day on which he was to have been\nexecuted, this woman came into the tent where he lay bound, and cut\nthe thongs with which he was tied, and telling him in a whisper to\nfollow her, she led the way out.With stealthy and cautious steps they made their way through the\nencampment, but when clear of this, they traveled as rapidly as the\ndarkness of the night and the nature of the ground would admit of.All night, and a portion of the next day they continued their journey.The rapidity with which she traveled, and her unhesitating manner,\nsoon convinced Flint that she was familiar with the country.Upon reaching Butterhill, or Mount Tecomthe, she led the way to the\ncave which we have already described.After resting for a few moments in the first chamber, the Indian\nwoman, who we may as well inform the reader was none other than our\nfriend Lightfoot, showed Flint the secret door and the entrance to the\ngrand chamber, which after lighting a torch made of pitch-pine, they\nentered.\"Here we are safe,\" said Lightfoot; \"Indians no find us here.\"The moment Flint entered this cavern it struck him as being a fine\nretreat for a band of pirates or smugglers, and for this purpose he\ndetermined to make use of it.Lightfoot's knowledge of this cave was owing to the fact, that she\nbelonged to a tribe to whom alone the secrets of the place were known.It was a tribe that had inhabited that part of the country for\ncenturies.But war and privation had so reduced them, that there was\nbut a small remnant of them left, and strangers now occupied their\nhunting grounds.The Indians in the neighborhood knew of the existence of the cave, but\nhad never penetrated farther than the first chamber, knowing nothing\nof the concealed entrance which led to the other.Having as they said,\nseen Indians enter it who never came out again, and who although\nfollowed almost immediately could not be found there, they began to\nhold it in a kind of awe, calling it the mystery or medicine cave, and\nsaying that it was under the guardianship of spirits.Although the remnants of the once powerful tribe to whom this cave had\nbelonged, were now scattered over the country, there existed between\nthem a sort of masonry by which the different members could recognise\neach other whenever they met.Fire Cloud, the Indian chief, who has already been introduced to the\nreader, was one of this tribe.Although the existence of the cave was known to the members of the\ntribe generally, the whole of its secrets were known to the medicine\nmen, or priests only.In fact it might be considered the grand temple where they performed\nthe mystic rites and ceremonies by which they imposed upon the people,\nand held them in subjection.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Flint immediately set about fitting up the place for the purpose which\nhe intended it.To the few white trappers who now and then visited the district, the\nexistence of the cave was entirely unknown, and even the few Indians\nwho hunted and fished in the neighborhood, were acquainted only with\nthe outer cave as before stated.When Flint was fully satisfied that all danger from pursuit was over,\nhe set out for the purpose of going to the city in order to perfect\nthe arrangements for carrying out the project he had in view.On passing out, the first object that met his view was his faithful\nfollower Black Bill, siting at the entrance.\"Follered de Ingins what was a comin' arter massa,\" replied the boy.Bill had followed his master into the wilderness, always like a body\nservant keeping near his person when not prevented by the Indians,\nwhich was the case while his master was a prisoner.When the escape of Flint was discovered, he was free from restraint,\nand he, unknown to the party who<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "From the <DW64>, Flint learned that the Indians had tracked him to the\ncave, but not finding him there, and not being able to trace him any\nfurther, they had given up the pursuit.Flint thinking that the boy might be of service to him in the business\nhe was about to enter upon, took him into the cave and put him in\ncharge of Lightfoot.On reaching the city, Flint purchased the schooner of which he was in\ncommand when first introduced to the reader.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.It is said that, \"birds of a feather flock together,\" and Flint having\nno difficulty gathering about him a number of kindred spirits, was\nsoon in a condition to enter upon the profession as he called it, most\ncongenial to his taste and habits.When the crew of the schooner woke up on the morning following the\nnight in which we have described in a previous chapter, they were by\nno means the reckless, dare-devil looking men they were when they\nentered the cave on the previous evening.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.For besides the usual effects produced on such characters by a night's\ndebauch, their countenances wore the haggard suspicious look of men\nwho felt judgment was hanging over them; that they were in the hands\nof some mysterious power beyond their control.Some power from which\nthey could not escape, and which sooner or later, would mete out to\nthem the punishment they felt that they deserved.They had all had troubled dreams, and several of them declared that\nthey had heard that terrible groan during the night repeated if\npossible, in a more horrible manner than before.To others the ghosts of the men they had lately murdered, appeared\nmenacing them with fearful retribution.As the day advanced, and they had to some extent recovered their\nspirits by the aid of their favorite stimulants, they attempted to\nlaugh the matter off as a mere bugbear created by an imagination over\nheated by too great an indulgence in strong drink.Although this opinion was not shared by Captain Flint, who had\ncarefully abstained from over-indulgence, for reasons of his own, he\nencouraged it in his men.But even they, while considering it necessary to remain quiet for a\nfew days, to see whether or not, any harm should result to them, in\nconsequence of their late attack on the merchant ship, none of them\nshowed a disposition to pass another night in the cave.Captain Flint made no objection to his men remaining outside on the\nfollowing night, as it would give him the opportunity to investigate\nthe matter, which he desired.On the next night, when there was no one in the cavern but himself and\nthe two who usually occupied it, he called Lightfoot to him, and asked\nher if she had ever heard any strange noises in the place before.\"Sometime heard de voices of the Indian braves dat gone to the spirit\nland,\" said the woman.\"Did you ever hear anything like the groan we heard last night?\"\"Tink him de voice ob the great bad spirit,\" was the reply.Captain Flint, finding that he was not likely to learn anything in\nthis quarter that would unravel the mystery, now called the <DW64>.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.\"Bill,\" he said, \"did you ever hear that noise before?\"\"When you trow my--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you black scoundrel, or I'll break every bone in\nyour body!\"roared his master, cutting off the boy's sentence in the\nmiddle.The boy was going to say:\n\n\"When you trow'd my fadder into the sea.\"The captain now examined every portion of the cavern, to see if he\ncould discover anything that could account for the production of the\nstrange sound.In every part he tried his voice, to see if he could produce those\nremarkable echoes, which had so startled him, on the previous night,\nbut without success.The walls, in various parts of the cavern, gave back echoes, but\nnothing like those of the previous night.There were two recesses in opposite sides of the cave.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.The larger one\nof these was occupied by Lightfoot as a sleeping apartment.The other,\nwhich was much smaller, Black Bill made use of for the same purpose.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.From these two recesses, the captain had everything removed, in order\nthat he might subject them to a careful examination.He tried his voice here, as in other parts of the cavern, but the\nwalls gave back no unusual echoes.He was completely baffled, and, placing his lamp on the table, he sat\ndown on one of the seats, to meditate on what course next to pursue.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the football there.Lightfoot and Bill soon after, at his request, retired.He had been seated, he could not tell how long, with his head resting\non his hands, when he was aroused by a yell more fearful, if possible,\neven than the groan that had so alarmed him on the previous night.The yell was repeated in the same horrible and mysterious manner that\nthe groan had been.Flint sprang to his feet while the echoes were still ringing in his\nears, and rushed to the sleeping apartment, first, to that of the\nIndian woman, and then, to that of the <DW64>.They both seemed to be sound asleep, to all appearance, utterly\nunconscious of the fearful racket that was going on around them.Captain Flint, more perplexed and bewildered than ever, resumed his\nseat by the table; but not to sleep again that night, though the\nfearful yell was not repeated.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.The captain prided himself on being perfectly free from all\nsuperstition.He held in contempt the stories of ghosts of murdered men coming back\nto torment their murderers.In fact, he was very much inclined to disbelieve in any hereafter at\nall, taking it to be only an invention of cunning priests, for the\npurpose of extorting money out of their silly dupes.But here was\nsomething, which, if not explained away, would go far to stagger his\ndisbelief.He was glad that the last exhibition had only been witnessed by\nhimself, and that the men for the present preferred passing their\nnights outside; for, as he learned from Lightfoot, the noises were\nonly during the night time.This would enable him to continue his investigation without any\ninterference on the part of the crew, whom he wished to keep in utter\nignorance of what he was doing, until he had perfectly unraveled the\nmystery.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.For this purpose, he gave Lightfoot and Black Bill strict charges not\nto inform the men of what had taken place during the night.He was determined to pass the principal portion of the day in sleep,\nso as to be wide awake when the time should come for him to resume his\ninvestigations.On the day after the first scene in the cave, late in the afternoon,\nthree men sat on the deck of the schooner, as she lay in the shadow of\nforest covered mountain.These were Jones Bradley, Old Ropes, and the man who went by the name\nof the Parson.They were discussing the occurrences of the previous\nnight.\"I'm very much of the captains opinion,\" said the Parson, \"that the\nnoises are caused by the wind rushing through the chinks and crevices\nof the rocks.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.\"Yes; but, then, there wan't no wind to speak of, and how is the wind\nto make that horrible groan, s'pose it did blow a hurricane?\"\"Just so,\" said Old Ropes; \"that notion about the wind makin' such a\nnoise at that, is all bosh.My opinion is, that it was the voice of a\nspirit.I know that the captain laughs at all such things, but all his\nlaughin' don't amount to much with one that's seen spirits.\"you don't mean to say that you ever actually see a live ghost?\"\"That's jist what I do mean to say,\" replied Old Ropes.\"Hadn't you been takin' a leetle too much, or wasn't the liquor too\nstrong?\"\"Well, you may make as much fun about it as you please,\" said Old\nRopes; \"but I tell you, that was the voice of a spirit, and, what's\nmore, I believe it's either the spirit of some one that's been\nmurdered in that cave, by some gang that's held it before, and buried\nthe body over the treasure they've stowed away there, or else the\nghost of some one's that's had foul play from the captain.\"\"Well,\" said the Parson, \"if I thought there was any treasure there\nworth lookin' after, all the ghosts you could scare up wouldn't hinder\nme from trying to get at it.\"\"But, no matter about that; you say you see a live ghost once.\"I suppose,\" said Old Ropes, \"that there aint no satisfaction in a\nfeller's tellin' of things that aint no credit to him; but,\nhowsomever, I might as well tell this, as, after all, it's only in the\nline of our business.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.\"You must know, then, that some five years ago, I shipped on board a\nbrig engaged in the same business that our craft is.\"I needn't tell you of all the battles we were in, and all the prizes\nwe made; but the richest prize that ever come in our way, was a\nSpanish vessel coming from Mexico, With a large amount of gold and\nsilver on board.\"We attacked the ship, expecting to make an easy prize of her, but we\nwere disappointed.\"The Spaniards showed fight, and gave us a tarnal sight of trouble.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.He swore that every soul that\nremained alive on the captured vessel should be put to death.\"Now, it so happened that the wife and child (an infant,) of the\ncaptain of the Spanish vessel, were on board.When the others had all\nbeen disposed of, the men plead for the lives of these two.But our\ncaptain would not listen to it; but he would let us cast lots to see\nwhich of us would perform the unpleasant office.\"As bad luck would have it, the lot fell upon me.\"It must be done; so, the plank was got ready.She took the baby in\nher arms, stepped upon the plank, as I ordered her, and the next\nmoment, she, with the child in her arms, sank to rise no more; but the\nlook she gave me, as she went down, I shall never forget.\"It haunts me yet, and many and many is the time that Spanish woman,\nwith the child in her arms, has appeared to me, fixing upon me the\nsame look that she gave me, as she sank in the sea.\"Luck left us from that time; we never took a prize afterwards.\"Our Vessel was captured by a Spanish cruiser soon afterwards.I, with\none other, succeeded in making our escape.\"The captain, and all the rest, who were not killed in the battle,\nwere strung out on the yard-arm.\"\"I suppose that's because she's a Spaniard, and thinks you don't\nunderstand her language,\" remarked the Parson, sneeringly.\"I wonder\nwhy this ghost of the cave don't show himself, and not try to frighten\nus with his horrible boo-wooing.\"\"Well, you may make as much fun as you please,\" replied Old Ropes;\n\"but, mark my words for it, if the captain don't pay attention to the\nwarning he has had, that ghost will show himself in a way that won't\nbe agreeable to any of us.\"\"If he takes my advice, he'll leave the cave, and take up his quarters\nsomewhere else.\"you don't mean to say you're afraid!\"\"Put an enemy before me in the shape of flesh and blood, and I'll show\nyou whether I'm afeard, or not,\" said Old Ropes; \"but this fighting\nwith dead men's another affair.Lead and\nsteel wont reach 'em, and the very sight on 'em takes the pluck out of\na man, whether he will or no.\"An enemy of real flesh and blood, when he does kill you, stabs you or\nshoots you down at once, and there's an end of it; but, these ghosts\nhave a way of killing you by inches, without giving a fellow a chance\nto pay them back anything in return.\"\"It's pretty clear, anway, that they're a 'tarnal set of cowards,\"\nremarked the Parson.\"The biggest coward's the bravest men, when there's no danger,\"\nretorted Old Ropes.To this, the Parson made no reply, thinking, probably, that he had\ncarried the joke far enough, and not wishing to provoke a quarrel with\nhis companion.\"As to the affair of the cave,\" said Jones Bradley; \"I think very much\nas Old Ropes does about it.I'm opposed to troubling the dead, and I\nbelieve there's them buried there that don't want to be disturbed by\nus, and if we don't mind the warning they give us, still the worse for\nus.\"\"The captain don't seem to be very much alarmed about it,\" said the\nParson; \"for he stays in the cave.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.And, then, there's the Indian woman\nand the darkey; the ghost don't seem to trouble them much.\"\"I'll say this for Captain Flint,\" remarked Old Ropes, \"if ever I\nknowed a man that feared neither man nor devil, that man is Captain\nFlint; but his time'll come yet.\"\"You don't mean to say you see breakers ahead, do you?\"\"Not in the way of our business, I don't mean,\" said Ropes; \"but, I've\nhad a pretty long experience in this profession, and have seen the\nfinishing up of a good many of my shipmates; and I never know'd one\nthat had long experience, that would not tell you that he had been put\nmore in fear by the dead than ever he had by the living.\"<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.\"We all seem to be put in low spirits by this afternoon,\" said the\nParson; \"s'pose we go below, and take a little something to cheer us\nup.\"To this the others assented, and all three went below.All Captain Flint's efforts to unravel the mysteries of the cave were\nunsuccessful; and he was reluctantly obliged to give up the attempt,\nat least for the present; but, in order to quiet the minds of the\ncrew, he told them that he had discovered the cause, and that it was\njust what he had supposed it to be.As everything remained quiet in the cave for a long time after this,\nand the minds of the men were occupied with more important matters,\nthe excitement caused by it wore off; and, in a while, the affair\nseemed to be almost forgotten.And here we may as well go back a little in our narrative, and restore\nthe chain where it was broken off a few chapters back.When Captain Flint had purchased the schooner which he commanded, it\nwas with the professed object of using her as a vessel to trade with\nthe Indians up the rivers, and along the shore, and with the various\nseaports upon the coast.To this trade it is true, he did to some extent apply himself, but\nonly so far as it might serve as a cloak to his secret and more\ndishonorable and dishonest practices.Had Flint been disposed to confine himself to the calling he pretended\nto follow, he might have made a handsome fortune in a short time, but\nthat would not have suited the corrupt and desperate character of the\nman.He was like one of those wild animals which having once tasted blood,\nhave ever afterward an insatiable craving for it.It soon became known to a few of the merchants in the city, among the\nrest Carl Rosenthrall, that Captain Flint had added to his regular\nbusiness, that of smuggling.This knowledge, however, being confined to those who shared the\nprofits with him, was not likely to be used to his disadvantage.After a while the whole country was put into a state of alarm by the\nreport that a desperate pirate had appeared on the coast.Several vessels which had been expected to arrive with rich cargoes\nhad not made their appearance, although the time for their arrival had\nlong passed.There was every reason to fear that they had been\ncaptured by this desperate stranger who had sunk them, killing all on\nboard.The captain of some vessels which had arrived in safety reported\nhaving been followed by a suspicious looking craft.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the apple there.They said she was a schooner about the size of one commanded by\nCaptain Flint, but rather longer, having higher masts and carrying\nmore sail.No one appeared to be more excited on the subject of the pirate, than\nCaptain Flint.He declared that he had seen the mysterious vessel, had\nbeen chased by her, and had only escaped by his superior sailing.Several vessels had been fitted out expressly for the purpose of\ncapturing this daring stranger, but all to no purpose; nothing could\nbe seen of her.For a long time she would seem to absent herself from the coast, and\nvessels would come and go in safety.Then all of a sudden, she would\nappear again and several vessels would be missing, and never heard\nfrom more.The last occurrence of this kind is the one which we have already\ngiven an account of the capturing and sinking of the vessel in which\nyoung Billings had taken passage for Europe.We have already seen how Hellena Rosenthrall's having accidentally\ndiscovered her lover's ring on the finger of Captain Flint, had\nexcited suspicions of the merchant's daughter, and what happened to\nher in consequence.Captain Flint having made it the interest of Rosenthrall to keep his\nsuspicions to himself if he still adhered to them, endeavored to\nconvince him that his daughter was mistaken, and that the ring however\nmuch it might resemble the one belonging to her lover, was one which\nhad been given to him by his own mother at her death, and had been\nworn by her as long as he could remember.This explanation satisfied, or seemed to satisfy the merchant, and the\ntwo men appeared to be as good friends as ever again.The sudden and strange disappearance of the daughter of a person of so\nmuch consequence as Carl Rosenthrall, would cause no little excitement\nin a place no larger than New York was at the time of which we write.Most of the people agreed in the opinion with the merchant that the\ngirl had been carried off by the Indian Fire Cloud, in order to avenge\nhimself for the insult he had received years before.As we have seen,\nCaptain Flint encouraged this opinion, and promised that in an\nexpedition he was about fitting out for the Indian country, he would\nmake the recovery of the young woman one of his special objects.Flint knew all the while where Fire Cloud was to be found, and fearing\nthat he might come to the city ignorant as he was of the suspicion he\nwas laboring under, and thereby expose the double game he was playing,\nhe determined to visit the Indian in secret, under pretence of putting\nhim on his guard, but in reality for the purpose of saving himself.He sought out the old chief accordingly, and warned him of his danger.Fire Cloud was greatly enraged to think that he should be suspected\ncarrying off the young woman.\"He hated her father,\" he said, \"for he was a cheat, and had a crooked\ntongue.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.But the paleface maiden was his friend, and for her sake he\nwould find her if she was among his people, and would restore her to\nher friends.\"\"If you enter the city of the palefaces, they will hang you up like a\ndog without listening to anything you have to say in your defence,\"\nsaid Flint.\"The next time Fire Cloud enters the city of the palefaces, the maiden\nshall accompany him,\" replied the Indian.This was the sort of an answer that Flint wished, and expected, and he\nnow saw that there was no danger to be apprehended from that quarter.But if Captain Flint felt himself relieved from danger in this\nquarter, things looked rather squally in another.If he knew how to\ndisguise his vessel by putting on a false bow so as to make her look\nlonger, and lengthen the masts so as to make her carry more sail, he\nwas not the only one who understood these tricks.And one old sailor\nwhose bark had been chased by the strange schooner, declared that she\nvery much resembled Captain Flint's schooner disguised in this way.And then it was observed that the strange craft was never seen when\nthe captain's vessel was lying in port, or when she was known to be up\nthe river where he was trading among the Indians.Another suspicious circumstance was, that shortly after the strange\ndisappearance of a merchant vessel, Flint's schooner came into port\nwith her rigging considerably damaged, as if she had suffered from\nsome unusual cause.Flint accounted for it by saying that he had been\nfired into by the pirate, and had just escaped with the skin of his\nteeth.These suspicions were at first spoken cautiously, and in whispers\nonly, by a very few.They came to the ears of Flint himself at last, who seeing the danger\nimmediately set about taking measures to counteract it by meeting and\nrepelling, what he pretended to consider base slanders invented by his\nenemies for the purpose of effecting his ruin.He threatened to prosecute the slanderers, and if they wished to see\nhow much of a pirate he was, let them fit out a vessel such as he\nwould describe, arm her, and man her according to his directions, give\nhim command of her, and if he didn't bring that blasted pirate into\nport he'd never return to it himself.He'd like no better fun than to\nmeet her on equal terms, in an open sea.This bragadocia had the desired effect for awhile; besides, although\nit could hardly be said that Flint had any real friends, yet there\nwere so many influential men who were concerned with him in some of\nhis contraband transactions.These dreaded the exposure to themselves,\nshould Flint's real character be discovered, which caused them to\nanswer for him in the place of friends.These men would no doubt be the first to crush him, could they only do\nso without involving themselves in his ruin.But all this helped to convince Flint that his time in this part of\nthe country was pretty near up, and if he meant to continue in his\npresent line of business, he must look out for some new field of\noperations.More than ever satisfied on this point, Captain Flint anxiously\nawaited the arrival of the vessel, the capture of which was to be the\nfinishing stroke of his operations in this part of the world.When Captain Flint had decided to take possession of the cavern, and\nfit it up as a place of retreat and concealment for himself and his\ngang, he saw the necessity of having some one whom he could trust to\ntake charge of the place in his absence.A moment's reflection\nsatisfied him there was no one who would be more likely to serve him\nin this capacity than the Indian woman who had rescued him from the\nfearful fate he had just escaped.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.Lightfoot, who in her simplicity, looked upon him as a great chief,\nwas flattered by the proposal which he made her, and immediately took\ncharge of the establishment, and Captain Flint soon found that he had\nno reason to repent the choice he had made, so far as fidelity to his\ninterests was concerned.For a while at first he treated her with as much kindness as it was in\nthe nature of such as he to treat any one.He may possibly have felt some gratitude for the service she had\nrendered him, but it was self-interest more than any other feeling\nthat caused him to do all in his power to gain a controling influence\nover her.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.He loaded her with presents of a character suited to her uncultivated\ntaste.Her person fairly glittered with beads, and jewelry of the most gaudy\ncharacter, while of shawls and blankets of the most

character\nwithout the risk of loosing his influence over her.His manner to her now changed, and he commenced treating her more as a\nslave than an equal, or one to whom he felt himself under obligations.It is true he would now and then treat her as formerly, and would\noccasionally make her rich presents, but it would be done in the way\nthat the master would bestow a favor on a servant.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.Lightfoot bore this unkind treatment for some time without resenting\nit, or appearing to notice it.Thinking perhaps that it was only a\nfreak of ill-humor that would last but for a short time, and then the\ngreat chiefs attachment would return.Flint fancied that he had won the heart of the Indian woman, and\nacting on the presumption that \"love is blind,\" he thought that he\ncould do as he pleased without loosing hold on her affections.He had only captured the woman's\nfancy.So that when Lightfoot found this altered manner of the captain's\ntowards her was not caused by a mere freak of humor, but was only his\ntrue character showing itself, her fondness for him, if fondness it\ncould be called, began to cool.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.Things had come to this pass, when Hellena Rosenthrall was brought\ninto the cave.The first thought of Lightfoot was that she had now discovered the\ncause of the captain's change of manner towards her.He had found\nanother object on which to lavish his favors and here was her rival.And she was to be the servant, the slave of this new favorite.Flint, in leaving Hellena in charge of Lightfoot, gave strict charges\nthat she should be treated with every attention, but that she should\nby no means be allowed to leave the cave.The manner of Lightfoot to Hellena, was at first sullen: and reserved,\nand although she paid her all the attention that Hellena required of\nher, she went no further.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.But after awhile, noticing the sad countenance of her paleface sister,\nand that her face was frequently bathed in tears, her heart softened\ntoward her, and she ventured to ask the cause of her sorrow.And when\nshe had heard Hellena's story, her feelings towards her underwent an\nentire change.From this time forward the two women were firm friends, and Lightfoot\npledged herself to do all in her power to restore her to her friends.Her attachment to Captain Flint was still too strong, however, to make\nher take any measures to effect that object, until she could do so\nwithout endangering his safety.But Lightfoot was not the only friend that Hellena had secured since\nher capture.She had made another, and if possible a firmer one, in\nthe person of Black Bill.From the moment Hellena entered the cavern, Bill seemed to be\nperfectly fascinated by her.Had she been an angel just from heaven,\nhis admiration for her could hardly have been greater.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.He could not\nkeep his eyes off of her.He followed her as she moved about, though\ngenerally at a respectful distance, and nothing delighted him so much,\nas to be allowed to wait upon her and perform for her such little acts\nof kindness as lay within his power.While Hellena was relating the story of her wrongs to Lightfoot, Black\nBill sat at a little distance off an attentive listener to the\nnarrative.When it was finished, and Hellena's eyes were filled with\ntears, the darkey sprang up saying in an encouraging tone of voice:\n\n\"Don't cry, don't cry misses, de debble's comin arter massa Flint\nberry soon, he tell me so hisself; den Black Bill take care ob de\nwhite angel.\"This sudden and earnest outburst of feeling and kindness from the\n<DW64>, expressed

Bill,\" said Hellena, \"you don't mean to say you ever saw the\ndevil here, do you?\"\"Never seed him, but heer'd him doe, sometimes,\" replied Bill.Now, Hellena, although a sensible girl in her way, was by no means\nfree from the superstition of the times.She believed in ghosts, and\nwitches, and fairies, and all that, and it was with a look of\nconsiderable alarm that she turned to the Indian woman, saying:\n\n\"I hope there ain't any evil spirits in this cave, Lightfoot.\"\"No spirits here dat will hurt White Rose (the name she had given to\nHellena) or Lightfoot,\" said the Indian woman.\"The spirits of the great Indian braves who have gone to the land of\nspirits come back here sometimes.\"\"Neber see dem, but hear dem sometime,\" replied Lightfoot.said Lightfoot, \"are they not my friends?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the apple.Lightfoot perceiving that Hellena's curiosity, as well as her fears\nwere excited; now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,\ncommenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to\nthe cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:\n\nShe said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had\nput foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land\nfor a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a\ngreat nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in\nthe bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough\nto contend with them was sure to be brought into subjection, if not\nutterly destroyed.Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for\nbravery.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted\nas much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land\nwas overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was\nbecause they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to\nthem in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal\nchiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit\nwould speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,\nevery thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said\nhe would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him\nthat they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if\nhe persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and\ntold them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great\nSpirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose\nof frightening him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a\ngreat brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to\nhim, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country\nof all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his\nown, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.And then\nhe laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into\nthe magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to\nsay.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came\nout sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,\nand his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation\nscattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.And he collected another great army, and went to war again./A man/ has the greatest power in pulling, for in that action he has\nthe united exertion of all the muscles of the arm, while some of them\nmust be inactive when he is pushing; because when the arm is extended\nfor that purpose, the muscles which move the elbow cannot act, any\nmore than if he pushed with his shoulders against the column he means\nto throw down; in which case only the muscles that extend the back,\nthe legs under the thigh, and the calves of the legs, would be active.From which we conclude, that in pulling there is added to the power\nof extension the strength of the arms, of the legs, of the back, and\neven of the chest, if the oblique motion of the body require it.But\nin pushing, though all the parts were employed, yet the strength of\nthe muscles of the arms is wanting; for to push with an extended

But I shall reply thus, that what is not performed by the\nshoulders in the figure C, is done by the hip, as is demonstrated in\nanother place.LXXXV./--_Of the Position of Figures_, Plate XIII.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom./In/ the same proportion as that part of the naked figure marked D A,\nlessens in height from the shoulder to the hip, on account of its\nposition the opposite side increases.And this is the reason: the\nfigure resting upon one (suppose the left) foot, that foot becomes the\ncentre of all the weight above; and the pit of the neck, formed by the\njunction of the two Clavicles, quits also its natural situation at the\nupper extremity of the perpendicular line (which passes through the\nmiddle surface of the body), to bend over the same foot; and as this\nline bends with it, it forces the transverse lines, which are always at\nright angles, to lower their extremities on that side where the foot\nrests, as appears in A B C. The navel and middle parts always preserve\ntheir natural height.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.LXXXVI./--_Of the Joints._\n\n\n/In/ the bending of the joints it is particularly useful to observe the\ndifference and variety of shape they assume; how the muscles swell on\none side, while they flatten on the other; and this is more apparent in\nthe neck, because the motion of it is of three sorts, two of which are\nsimple motions, and the other complex, participating also of the other\ntwo.The simple motions are, first, when the neck bends towards the\nshoulder, either to the right or left, and when it raises or lowers\nthe head.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without\nrising or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of\nthe shoulders.The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to\nthe bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards\none of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face\nturned upwards.LXXXVII./--_Of the Shoulders._\n\n\n/Of/ those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the\nprincipal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and\nforwards.Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if\nthe arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the\nmotions belonging to the shoulders.Every continued quantity being\ndivisible _ad infinitum_, and this circle being a continued quantity,\nproduced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the\ncircumference, it follows, that the motions of the shoulders may also be\nsaid to be infinite._London, Published by J.

Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.XCVI./--_The greatest Twist which a Man can make, in turning to\nlook at himself behind._ Plate XVII./The/ greatest twist that the body can perform is when the back of\nthe heels and the front of the face are seen at the same time.It is\nnot done without difficulty, and is effected by bending the leg and\nlowering the shoulder on that side towards which the head turns.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.The\ncause of this motion, and also which of the muscles move first and\nwhich last, I shall explain in my treatise on anatomy[23].XCVII./--_Of turning the Leg without the Thigh._\n\n\n/It/ is impossible to turn the leg inwards or outwards without turning\nthe thigh by the same motion, because the setting in of the bones at\nthe knee is such, that they have no motion but backwards and forwards,\nand no more than is necessary for walking or kneeling; never sideways,\nbecause the form of the bones at the joint of the knee does not allow\nit.If this joint had been made pliable on all sides, as that of the\nshoulder, or that of the thigh bone with the hip, a man would have\nhad his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards,\nand seldom or never straight with the thigh.Besides, this joint can\nbend only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the\nstraight line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend\nbackwards, a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he\nwere kneeling; as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on\nboth knees), he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees\nto support, unloading the other, which at that time feels no other\nweight than its own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests\nhis foot flat upon the ground; then returning the whole weight upon\nthat foot, and leaning his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the\nother arm, raises his head, and straightening the thigh with the body,\nhe springs up, and rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the\nother.XCVIII./--_Postures of Figures._\n\n\n/Figures/ that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have\nsome contrast of parts.If one arm come before, the other remains\nstill or goes behind.If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on\nthat side will be lower than the other.This is observed by artists\nof judgment, who always take care to balance the figure well upon its\nfeet, for fear it should appear to fall.Because by resting upon one\nfoot, the other leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any\nmore than if it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts\nabove that leg should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg\nwhich supports the body.XCIX./--_Of the Gracefulness of the Members._\n\n\n/The/ members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions,\nexpressive of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey.If it had to give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the\nmembers must be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very\nslightly marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily\nappear; the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight\nline with any other adjoining member.If it happen, on account of the\nmotion of the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make\nthe joint of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of\nthat hip; and let that right shoulder be lower than the left.The pit\nof the neck will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep\nof the foot that supports the body.The leg that does not bear will\nhave its knee a little lower than the other, and near the other leg.In regard to the positions of the head and arms, they are infinite, and\nfor that reason I shall not enter into any detailed rule concerning\nthem; suffice it to say, that they are to be easy and free, graceful,\nand varied in their bendings, so that they may not appear stiff like\npieces of wood.C./--_That it is impossible for any Memory to retain the Aspects\nand Changes of the Members._\n\n\n/It/ is impossible that any memory can be able to retain all the\naspects or motions of any member of any animal whatever.This case\nwe shall exemplify by the appearance of the hand.And because any\ncontinued quantity is divisible _ad infinitum_, the motion of the eye\nwhich looks at the hand, and moves from A to B, moves by a space A B,\nwhich is also a continued quantity, and consequently divisible _ad\ninfinitum_, and in every part of the motion varies to its view the\naspect and figure of the hand; and so it will do if it move round the\nwhole circle.The same will the hand do which is raised in its motion,\nthat is, it will pass over a space, which is a continued quantity[24].[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CI./--_The Motions of Figures._\n\n\n/Never/ put the head straight upon the shoulders, but a little turned\nsideways to the right or left, even though the figures should be\nlooking up or down, or straight, because it is necessary to give them\nsome motion of life and spirit.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.Nor ever compose a figure in such\na manner, either in a front or back view, as that every part falls\nstraight upon another from the top to the bottom.But if you wish to\nintroduce such a figure, use it for old age.Never repeat the same\nmotion of arms, or of legs, not only not in the same figure, but in\nthose which are standing by, or near; if the necessity of the case,\nor the expression of the subject you represent, do not oblige you to\nit[25].CII./--_Of common Motions._\n\n\n/The/ variety of motions in man are equal to the variety of accidents\nor thoughts affecting the mind, and each of these thoughts, or\naccidents, will operate more or less, according to the temper and age\nof the subject; for the same cause will in the actions of youth, or of\nold age, produce very different effects.CIII./--_Of simple Motions._\n\n\n/Simple/ motion is that which a man performs in merely bending\nbackwards or forwards.CIV./--_Complex Motion._\n\n\n/Complex/ motion is that which, to produce some particular action,\nrequires the body to bend downwards and sideways at the same time.The\npainter must be careful in his compositions to apply these complex\nmotions according to the nature of the subject, and not to weaken or\ndestroy the effect of it by introducing figures with simple motions,\nwithout any connexion with the subject.CV./--_Motions appropriated to the Subject._\n\n\n/The/ motions of your figures are to be expressive of the quantity of\nstrength requisite to the force of the action.Let not the same effort\nbe used to take up a stick as would easily raise a piece of timber.Therefore shew great variety in the expression of strength, according\nto the quality of the load to be managed.CVI./--_Appropriate Motions._\n\n\n/There/ are some emotions of the mind which are not expressed by any\nparticular motion of the body, while in others, the expression cannot\nbe shewn without it.In the first, the arms fall down, the hands and\nall the other parts, which in general are the most active, remain at\nrest.But such emotions of the soul as produce bodily action, must put\nthe members into such motions as are appropriated to the intention of\nthe mind.This, however, is an ample subject, and we have a great deal\nto say upon it.There is a third kind of motion, which participates\nof the two already described; and a fourth, which depends neither on\nthe one nor the other.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.This last belongs to insensibility, or fury,\nand should be ranked with madness or stupidity;

while the legs close\ntogether shew modesty.CVIII./--_Of the Postures of Children._\n\n\n/Children/ and old people are not to express quick motions, in what\nconcerns their legs.CIX./--_Of the Motion of the Members._\n\n\n/Let/ every member be employed in performing its proper functions.For\ninstance, in a dead body, or one asleep, no member should appear alive\nor awake.A foot bearing the weight of the whole body, should not be\nplaying its toes up and down, but flat upon the ground; except when it\nrests entirely upon the heel.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.CX./--_Of mental Motions._\n\n\n/A mere/ thought, or operation of the mind, excites only simple and\neasy motions of the body; not this way, and that way, because its\nobject is in the mind, which does not affect the senses when it is\ncollected within itself.CXI./--_Effect of the Mind upon the Motions of the Body,\noccasioned by some outward Object._\n\n\n/When/ the motion is produced by the presence of some object, either\nthe cause is immediate or not.If it be immediate, the figure will\nfirst turn towards it the organs most necessary, the eyes; leaving its\nfeet in the same place; and will only move the thighs, hips, and knees\na little towards the same side, to which the eyes are directed.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.CXII./--_Of those who apply themselves to the Practice, without\nhaving learnt the Theory of the Art._\n\n\n/Those/ who become enamoured of the practice of the art, without having\npreviously applied to the diligent study of the scientific part of it,\nmay be compared to mariners, who put to sea in a ship without rudder or\ncompass, and therefore cannot be certain of arriving at the wished-for\nport.Practice must always be founded on good theory; to this, Perspective is\nthe guide and entrance, without which nothing can be well done.CXIII./--_Precepts in Painting._\n\n\n/Perspective/ is to Painting what the bridle is to a horse, and the\nrudder to a ship.The", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "If a figure be seen of the natural size, remember that it denotes its\nbeing near to the eye.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.CXIV./--_Of the Boundaries of Objects called Outlines or\nContours._\n\n\n/The/ outlines or contours of bodies are so little perceivable, that\nat any small distance between that and the object, the eye will not be\nable to recognise the features of a friend or relation, if it were not\nfor their clothes and general appearance.So that by the knowledge of\nthe whole it comes to know the parts.CXV./--_Of linear Perspective._\n\n\n/Linear/ Perspective consists in giving, by established rules, the true\ndimensions of objects, according to their respective distances; so that\nthe second object be less than the first, the third than the second,\nand by degrees at last they become invisible.I find by experience,\nthat, if the second object be at the same distance from the first, as\nthe first is from the eye, though they be of the same size, the second\nwill appear half the size of the first; and, if the third be at the\nsame distance behind the second, it will diminish two thirds; and so\non, by degrees, they will, at equal distances, diminish in proportion;\nprovided that the interval be not more than twenty cubits[26]; at\nwhich distance it will lose two fourths of its size: at forty it will\ndiminish three fourths; and at sixty it will lose five sixths, and so\non progressively.But you must be distant from your picture twice the\nsize of it; for, if you be only once the size, it will make a great\ndifference in the measure from the first to the second.CXVI./--_What Parts of Objects disappear first by Distance._\n\n\n/Those/ parts which are of less magnitude will first vanish from the\nsight[27].This happens, because the shape of small objects, at an\nequal distance, comes to the eye under a more acute angle than the\nlarge ones, and the perception of them is less, in proportion as they\nare less in magnitude.It follows then, that if the large objects, by\nbeing removed to a great distance, and consequently coming to the eye\nby a small angle, are almost lost to the sight, the small objects will\nentirely disappear.CXVII./--_Of remote Objects._\n\n\n/The/ outlines of objects will be less seen, in proportion as they are\nmore distant from the eye.CXVIII./--_Of the Point of Sight._\n\n\n/The/ point of sight must be on a level with the eyes of a common-sized\nman, and placed upon the horizon, which is the line formed by a flat\ncountry terminating with the sky.An exception must be made as to\nmountains, which are above that line.CXIX./--_A Picture is to be viewed from one Point only._\n\n\n/This/ will be proved by one single example.If you mean to represent\na round ball very high up, on a flat and perpendicular wall, it will\nbe necessary to make it oblong, like the shape of an egg, and to place\nyourself (that is, the eye, or point of view) so far back, as that its\noutline or circumference may appear round.CXX./--_Of the Dimensions of the first Figure in an historical\nPainting._\n\n\n/The/ first figure in your picture will be less than Nature, in\nproportion as it recedes from the front of the picture, or the bottom\nline; and by the same rule the others behind it will go on lessening in\nan equal degree[28].CXXI./--_Of Objects that are lost to the Sight in Proportion to\ntheir Distance._\n\n\n/The/ first things that disappear, by being removed to some distance,\nare the outlines or boundaries of objects.The second, as they remove\nfarther, are the shadows which divide contiguous bodies.The third\nare the thickness of legs and feet; and so in succession the small\nparts are lost to the sight, till nothing remains but a confused mass,\nwithout any distinct parts.CXXII./--_Errors not so easily seen in small Objects as in large\nones._\n\n\n/Supposing/ this small object to represent a man, or any other animal,\nalthough the parts, by being so much diminished or reduced, cannot be\nexecuted with the same exactness of proportion, nor finished with the\nsame accuracy, as if on a larger scale, yet on that very account the\nfaults will be less conspicuous.For example, if you look at a man at\nthe distance of two hundred yards, and with all due attention mean to\nform a judgment, whether he be handsome or ugly, deformed or well made,\nyou will find that, with all your endeavours, you can hardly venture\nto decide.The reason is, that the man diminishes so much by the\ndistance, that it is impossible to distinguish the parts minutely.If\nyou wish to know by demonstration the diminution of the above figure,\nhold your finger up before your eye at about nine inches distance, so\nthat the top of your finger corresponds with the top of the head of\nthe distant figure: you will perceive that your finger covers, not\nonly its head, but part of its body; which is an evident proof of the\napparent diminution of that object.Hence it often happens, that we are\ndoubtful, and can scarcely, at some distance, distinguish the form of\neven a friend.CXXIII./--_Historical Subjects one above another on the same\nWall to be avoided._\n\n\n/This/ custom, which has been generally adopted by painters, on the\nfront and sides of chapels, is much to be condemned.They begin with an\nhistorical picture, its landscape and buildings, in one compartment.After which, they raise another compartment, and execute another\nhistory with other buildings upon another level; and from thence they\nproceed to a third and fourth, varying the point of sight, as if the\nbeholder was going up steps, while, in fact, he must look at them all\nfrom below, which is very ill judged in those matters.We know that the point of sight is the eye of the spectator; and if\nyou ask, how is a series of subjects, such as the life of a saint, to\nbe represented, in different compartments on the same wall?I answer,\nthat you are to place the principal event in the largest compartment,\nand make the point of sight as high as the eye of the spectator.Begin\nthat subject with large figures; and as you go up, lessen the objects,\nas well the figures, as buildings, varying the plans according to the\neffect of perspective; but never varying the point of sight: and so\ncomplete the series of subjects, till you come to a certain height,\nwhere terrestrial objects can be seen no more, except the tops of\ntrees, or clouds and birds; or if you introduce figures, they must be\naerial, such as angels, or saints in glory, or the like, if they suit\nthe purpose of your history.If not, do not undertake this kind of\npainting, for your work will be faulty, and justly reprehensible[29].CXXIV./--_Why Objects in Painting can never detach, as natural\nObjects do._\n\n\n/Painters/ often despair of being able to imitate Nature, from\nobserving, that their pictures have not the same relief, nor the same\nlife, as natural objects have in a looking-glass, though they both\nappear upon a plain surface.They say, they have colours which surpass\nin brightness the quality of the lights, and in darkness the quality of\nthe shades of the objects seen in the looking-glass; but attribute this\ncircumstance to their own ignorance, and not to the true cause, because\nthey do not know it.It is impossible that objects in painting should\nappear with the same relief as those in the looking-glass, unless we\nlook at them with only one eye.The two eyes A B looking at objects one behind\nanother, as M and N, see them both; because M cannot entirely occupy\nthe space of N, by reason that the base of the visual rays is so broad,\nthat the second object is seen behind the first.But if one eye be\nshut, and you look with the other S, the body F will entirely cover\nthe body R, because the visual rays beginning at one point, form a\ntriangle, of which the body F is the base, and being prolonged, they\nform two diverging tangents at the two extremities of F, which cannot\ntouch the body R behind it, therefore can never see it[30].[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CXXV./--_How to give the proper Dimension to Objects in\nPainting._\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n/In/ order to give the appearance of the natural size, if the piece\nbe small (as miniatures), the figures on the fore-ground are to be\nfinished with as much precision as those of any large painting, because\nbeing small they are to be brought up close to the eye.But large\npaintings are seen at some distance; whence it happens, that though\nthe figures in each are so different in size, in appearance they will\nbe the same.This proceeds from the eye receiving those objects under\nthe same angle; and it is proved thus.Let the large painting be B C,\nthe eye A, and D E a pane of glass, through which are seen the figures\nsituated at B C. I say that the eye being fixed, the figures in the\ncopy of the paintings B C are to be smaller, in proportion as the glass\nD E is nearer the eye A, and are to be as precise and finished.But if\nyou will execute the picture B C upon the glass D E, this ought to be\nless finished than the picture B C, and more so than the figure M N\ntransferred upon the glass F G; because, supposing the figure P O to\nbe as much finished as the natural one in B C, the perspective of O P\nwould be false, since, though in regard to the diminution of the figure\nit would be right, B C being diminished in P O, the finishing would not\nagree with the distance, because in giving it the perfection of the\nnatural B C, B C would appear as near as O P; but, if you search for\nthe diminution of O P, O P will be found at the distance B C, and the\ndiminution of the finishing as at F G.CXXVI./--_How to draw accurately any particular Spot._\n\n\n/Take/ a glass as large as your paper, fasten it well between your eye\nand the object you mean to draw, and fixing your head in a frame (in\nsuch a manner as not to be able to move it) at the distance of two\nfeet from the glass; shut one eye, and draw with a pencil accurately\nupon the glass all that you see through it.After that, trace upon\npaper what you have drawn on the glass, which tracing you may paint at\npleasure, observing the aerial perspective.CXXVII./--_Disproportion to be avoided, even in the accessory\nParts._\n\n\n/A great/ fault is committed by many painters, which is highly to be\nblamed, that is, to represent the habitations of men, and other parts\nof their compositions, so low, that the doors do not reach as high as\nthe knees of their inhabitants, though, according to their situation,\nthey are nearer to the eye of the spectator, than the men who seem\nwilling to enter them.I have seen some pictures with porticos,\nsupported by columns loaded with figures; one grasping a column against\nwhich it leans, as if it were a walking-stick, and other similar\nerrors, which are to be avoided with the greatest care.INVENTION, /or/ COMPOSITION.CXXVIII./--_Precept for avoiding a bad Choice in the Style or\nProportion of Figures._\n\n\n/The/ painter ought to form his style upon the most proportionate\nmodel in Nature; and after having measured that, he ought to measure\nhimself also, and be perfectly acquainted with his own defects or\ndeficiencies; and having acquired this knowledge, his constant care\nshould be to avoid conveying into his work those defects which he has\nfound in his own person; for these defects, becoming habitual to his\nobservation, mislead his judgment, and he perceives them no longer.We\nought, therefore, to struggle against such a prejudice, which grows\nup with us; for the mind, being fond of its own habitation, is apt to\nrepresent it to our imagination as beautiful.From the same motive it\nmay be, that there is not a woman, however plain in her person, who may\nnot find her admirer, if she be not a monster.Against this bent of the\nmind you ought very cautiously to be on your guard.CXXIX./--_Variety in Figures._\n\n\n/A painter/ ought to aim at universal excellence; for he will be\ngreatly wanting in dignity, if he do one thing well and another badly,\nas many do, who study only the naked figure, measured and proportioned\nby a pair of compasses in their hands, and do not seek for variety.A\nman may be well proportioned, and yet be tall or short, large or lean,\nor of a middle size; and whoever does not make great use of these\nvarieties, which are all existing in Nature in its most perfect state,\nwill produce figures as if cast in one and the same mould, which is\nhighly reprehensible.CXXX./--_How a Painter ought to proceed in his Studies._\n\n\n/The/ painter ought always to form in his mind a kind of system of\nreasoning or discussion within himself on any remarkable object\nbefore him.He should stop, take notes, and form some rule upon it;\nconsidering the place, the circumstances, the lights and shadows.CXXXI./--_Of sketching Histories and Figures._\n\n\n/Sketches/ of historical subjects must be slight, attending only to the\nsituation of the figures, without regard to the finishing of particular\nmembers, which may be done afterwards at leisure, when the mind is so\ndisposed.CXXXII./--_How to study Composition._\n\n\n/The/ young student should begin by sketching slightly some single\nfigure, and turn that on all sides, knowing already how to contract,\nand how to extend the members; after which, he may put two together in\nvarious attitudes, we will suppose in the act of fighting boldly.This\ncomposition also he must try on all sides, and in a variety of ways,\ntending to the same expression.Then he may imagine one of them very\ncourageous, while the other is a coward.Let these attitudes, and many\nother accidental affections of the mind, be with great care studied,\nexamined, and dwelt upon.CXXXIII./--_Of the Attitudes of Men._\n\n\n/The/ attitudes and all the members are to be disposed in such\na manner, that by them the intentions of the mind may be easily\ndiscovered.CXXXIV./--_Variety of Positions._\n\n\n/The/ positions of the human figure are to be adapted to the age and\nrank; and to be varied according to the difference of the sexes, men or\nwomen.CXXXV./--_Of Studies from Nature for History._\n\n\n/It/ is necessary to consider well the situation for which the history\nis to be painted, particularly the height; and let the painter place\naccordingly the model, from which he means to make his studies for that\nhistorical picture; and set himself as much below the object, as the\npicture is to be above the eye of the spectator, otherwise the work\nwill be faulty.CXXXVI./--_Of the Variety of Figures in History Painting._\n\n\n/History/ painting must exhibit variety in its fullest extent.In\ntemper, size, complexion, actions, plumpness, leanness, thick, thin,\nlarge, small, rough, smooth, old age and youth, strong and muscular,\nweak, with little appearance of muscles, cheerfulness and melancholy.Some should be with curled hair, and some with straight; some short,\nsome long, some quick in their motions, and some slow, with a variety\nof dresses and colours, according as the subject may require.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.CXXXVII./--_Of Variety in History._\n\n\n/A painter/ should delight in introducing great variety into his\ncompositions, avoiding repetition, that by this fertility of invention\nhe may attract and charm the eye of the beholder.If it be requisite\naccording to the subject meant to be represented, that there should be\na mixture of men differing in their faces, ages, and dress, grouped\nwith women, children, dogs, and horses, buildings, hills and flat\ncountry; observe dignity and decorum in the principal figure; such\nas a king, magistrate, or philosopher, separating them from the low\nclasses of the people.Mix not afflicted or weeping figures with joyful\nand laughing ones; for Nature dictates that the cheerful be attended\nby others of the same disposition of mind.Laughter is productive of\nlaughter, and _vice versa_.CXXXVIII./--_Of the Age of Figures._\n\n\n/Do/ not bring together a number of boys with as many old men, nor\nyoung men with infants, nor women with men; if the subject you mean to\nrepresent does not oblige you to it.CXXXIX./--_Of Variety of Faces._\n\n\n/The/ Italian painters have been accused of a common fault, that is,\nof introducing into their compositions the faces, and even the whole\nfigures, of Roman emperors, which they take from the antique.To\navoid such an error, let no repetition take place, either in parts,\nor the whole of a figure; nor let there be even the same face in\nanother composition: and the more the figures are contrasted, viz.the\ndeformed opposed to the beautiful, the old to the young, the strong\nto the feeble, the more the picture will please and be admired.These\ndifferent characters, contrasted with each other, will increase the\nbeauty of the whole.It frequently happens that a painter, while he is composing, will use\nany little sketch or scrap of drawing he has by him, and endeavour to\nmake it serve his purpose; but this is extremely injudicious, because\nhe may very often find that the members he has drawn have not the\nmotion suited to what he means to express; and after he has adopted,\naccurately drawn, and even well finished them, he will be loth to rub\nout and change them for others.CXL./--_A Fault in Painters._\n\n\n/It/ is a very great fault in a painter to repeat the same motions in\nfigures, and the same folds in draperies in the same composition, as\nalso to make all the faces alike.CXLI./--_How you may learn to compose Groups for History\nPainting._\n\n\n/When/ you are well instructed in perspective, and know perfectly how\nto draw the anatomy and forms of different bodies or objects, it should\nbe your delight to observe and consider in your walks the different\nactions of men, when they are talking, or quarrelling; when they laugh,\nand when they fight.Attend to their positions, and to those of the\nspectators; whether they are attempting to separate those who fight,\nor merely lookers-on.Be quick in sketching these with slight strokes\nin your pocket-book, which should always be about you, and made of\nstained paper, as you ought not to rub out.When it is full, take\nanother, for these are not things to be rubbed out, but kept with the\ngreatest care; because forms and motions of bodies are so infinitely\nvarious, that the memory is not able to retain them; therefore preserve\nthese sketches as your assistants and masters.CXLII./--_How to study the Motions of the human Body._\n\n\n/The/ first requisite towards a perfect acquaintance with the various\nmotions of the human body, is the knowledge of all the parts,\nparticularly the joints, in all the attitudes in which it may be\nplaced.Then make slight sketches in your pocket-book, as opportunities\noccur, of the actions of men, as they happen to meet your eye, without\nbeing perceived by them; because, if they were to observe you, they\nwould be disturbed from that freedom of action, which is prompted by\ninward feeling; as when two men are quarrelling and angry, each of\nthem seeming to be in the right, and with great vehemence move their\neyebrows, arms, and all the other members, using motions appropriated\nto their words and feelings.This they could not do, if you wanted them\nto imitate anger, or any other accidental emotion; such as laughter,\nweeping, pain, admiration, fear, and the like.For that reason, take\ncare never to be without a little book, for the purpose of sketching\nthose various motions, and also groups of people standing by.This\nwill teach you how to compose history.Two things demand the principal\nattention of a good painter.One is the exact outline and shape of the\nfigure; the other, the true expression of what passes in the mind of\nthat figure, which he must feel, and that is very important.CXLIII./--_Of Dresses, and of Draperies and Folds._\n\n\n/The/ draperies with which you dress figures ought to have their\nfolds so accommodated as to surround the parts they are intended to\ncover; that in the mass of light there be not any dark fold, and in\nthe mass of shadows none receiving too great a light.They must go\ngently over, describing the parts; but not with lines across, cutting\nthe members with hard notches, deeper than the part can possibly\nbe; at the same time, it must fit the body, and not appear like an\nempty bundle of cloth; a fault of many painters, who, enamoured of\nthe quantity and variety of folds, have encumbered their figures,\nforgetting the intention of clothes, which is to dress and surround the\nparts gracefully wherever they touch; and not to be filled with wind,\nlike bladders, puffed up where the parts project.I do not deny that\nwe ought not to neglect introducing some handsome folds among these\ndraperies, but it must be done with great judgment, and suited to the\nparts, where, by the actions of the limbs and position of the whole\nbody, they gather together.Above all, be careful to vary the quality\nand quantity of your folds in compositions of many figures; so that,\nif some have large folds, produced by thick woollen cloth; others,\nbeing dressed in thinner stuff, may have them narrower; some sharp and\nstraight, others soft and undulating.CXLIV./--_Of the Nature of Folds in Draperies._\n\n\n/Many/ painters prefer making the folds of their draperies with acute\nangles, deep and precise; others with angles hardly perceptible; and\nsome with none at all; but instead of them, certain curved lines.CXLV./--_How the Folds of Draperies ought to be represented_,\nPlate XVIII./That/ part of the drapery, which is the farthest from the place where\nit is gathered, will appear more approaching its natural state.Every\nthing naturally inclines to preserve its primitive form.Therefore a\nstuff or cloth, which is of equal thickness on both sides, will always\nincline to remain flat.For that reason, when it is constrained by some\nfold to relinquish its flat situation, it is observed that, at the part\nof its greatest restraint, it is continually making efforts to return\nto its natural shape; and the parts most distant from it reassume more\nof their primitive state by ample and distended folds.For example, let\nA B C be the drapery mentioned above; A B the place where it is folded\nor restrained.I have said that the part, which is farthest from the\nplace of its restraint, would return more towards its primitive shape.Therefore C being the farthest, will be broader and more extended than\nany other part._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 69_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CXLVI./--_How the Folds in Draperies ought to be made._\n\n\n/Draperies/ are not to be encumbered with many folds: on the contrary,\nthere ought to be some only where they are held up with the hands or\narms of the figures, and the rest left to fall with natural simplicity.They ought to be studied from Nature; that is to say, if a woollen\ncloth be intended, the folds ought to be drawn after such cloth; if it\nbe of silk, or thin stuff, or else very thick for labourers, let it\nbe distinguished by the nature of the folds.But never copy them, as\nsome do, after models dressed in paper, or thin leather, for it greatly\nmisleads.CXLVII./--_Fore-shortening of Folds_, Plate XIX./Where/ the figure is fore-shortened, there ought to appear a greater\nnumber of folds, than on the other parts, all surrounding it in a\ncircular manner.M N will have the\nmiddle of every circular fold successively removed farther from its\noutline, in proportion as it is more distant from the eye.In M O of\nthe other figure the outlines of these circular folds will appear\nalmost straight, because it is situated opposite the eye; but in P and\nQ quite the contrary, as in N and M.CXLVIII./--_Of Folds._\n\n\n/The/ folds of draperies, whatever be the motion of the figure, ought\nalways to shew, by the form of their outlines, the attitude of such\nfigure; so as to leave, in the mind of the beholder, no doubt or\nconfusion in regard to the true position of the body; and let there be\nno fold, which, by its shadow, breaks through any of the members; that\nis to say, appearing to go in deeper than the surface of the part it\ncovers.And if you represent the figure clothed with several garments,\none over the other, let it not appear as if the upper one covered only\na mere skeleton; but let it express that it is also well furnished with\nflesh, and a thickness of folds, suitable to the number of its under\ngarments.The folds surrounding the members ought to diminish in thickness near\nthe extremities of the part they surround.The length of the folds, which are close to the members, ought to\nproduce other folds on that side where the member is diminished by\nfore-shortening, and be more extended on the opposite side.CXLIX./--_Of Decorum._\n\n\n/Observe/ decorum in every thing you represent, that is, fitness of\naction, dress, and situation, according to the dignity or meanness of\nthe subject to be represented.Be careful that a king, for instance,\nbe grave and majestic in his countenance and dress; that the place be\nwell decorated; and that his attendants, or the by-standers, express\nreverence and admiration, and appear as noble, in dresses suitable to a\nroyal court.On the contrary, in the representation of a mean subject, let the\nfigures appear low and despicable; those about them with similar\ncountenances, and actions, denoting base and presumptuous minds, and\nmeanly clad.In short, in both cases, the parts must correspond with\nthe general sentiment of the composition.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.The motions of old age should not be similar to those of youth; those\nof a woman to those of a man; nor should the latter be the same as\nthose of a boy.CL./--_The Character of Figures in Composition._\n\n\n/In/ general, the painter ought to introduce very few old men, in the\nordinary course of historical subjects, and those few separated from\nyoung people; because old people are few, and their habits do not agree\nwith those of youth.Where there is no conformity of custom, there can\nbe no intimacy, and, without it, a company is soon separated.But if\nthe subject require an appearance of gravity, a meeting on important\nbusiness, as a council, for instance, let there be few young men\nintroduced, for youth willingly avoids such meetings.CLI./--_The Motion of the Muscles, when the Figures are in\nnatural Positions._\n\n\n/A figure/, which does not express by its position the sentiments and\npassions, by which we suppose it animated, will appear to indicate\nthat its muscles are not obedient to its will, and the painter very\ndeficient in judgment.For that reason, a figure is to shew great\neagerness and meaning; and its position is to be so well appropriated\nto that meaning, that it cannot be mistaken, nor made use of for any\nother.CLII./--_A Precept in Painting._\n\n\n/The/ painter ought to notice those quick motions, which men are apt to\nmake without thinking, when impelled by strong and powerful affections\nof the mind.He ought to take memorandums of them, and sketch them in\nhis pocket-book, in order to make use of them when they may answer his\npurpose; and then to put a living model in the same position, to see\nthe quality and aspect of the muscles which are in action.CLIII./--_Of the Motion of Man_, Plates XX./The/ first and principal part of the art is composition of any sort,\nor putting things together.The second relates to the expression and\nmotion of the figures, and requires that they be well appropriated,\nand seeming attentive to what they are about; appearing to move with\nalacrity and spirit, according to the degree of expression suitable\nto the occasion; expressing slow and tardy motions, as well as those\nof eagerness in pursuit: and that quickness and ferocity be expressed\nwith such force as to give an idea of the sensations of the actors.When a figure is to throw a dart, stones, or the like, let it be\nseen evidently by the attitude and disposition of all the members,\nthat such is its intention; of which there are two examples in the\nopposite plates, varied both in action and power.The first in point\nof vigour is A. The second is B. But A will throw his weapon farther\nthan B, because, though they seem desirous of throwing it to the same\npoint, A having turned his feet towards the object, while his body is\ntwisted and bent back the contrary way, to increase his power, returns\nwith more velocity and force to the point to which he means to throw.But the figure B having turned his feet the same way as his body,\nit returns to its place with great inconvenience, and consequently\nwith weakened powers.For in the expression of great efforts, the\npreparatory motions of the body must be strong and violent, twisting\nand bending, so that it may return with convenient ease, and by that\nmeans have a great effect.In the same manner, if a cross-bow be not\nstrung with force, the motion of whatever it shoots will be short and\nwithout effect; because, where there is no impulse, there can be no\nmotion; and if the impulse be not violent, the motion is but tardy\nand feeble.So a bow, which is not strong, has no motion; and, if it\nbe strung, it will remain in that state till the impulse be given\nby another power which puts it in motion, and it will shoot with a\nviolence equal to that which was employed in bending it.In the same\nmanner, the man who does not twist and bend his body will have acquired\nno power.Therefore, after A has thrown his dart, he will find himself\ntwisted the contrary way, viz.on the side where he has thrown; and\nhe will have acquired only power sufficient to serve him to return to\nwhere he was at first._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 72_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.CLIV./--_Of Attitudes, and the Motions of the Members._\n\n\n/The/ same attitude is not to be repeated in the same picture, nor the\nsame motion of members in the same figure, nay, not even in the hands\nor fingers.And if the history requires a great number of figures, such\nas a battle, or a massacre of soldiers, in which there are but three\nways of striking, viz.thrusting, cutting, or back-handed; in that\ncase you must take care, that all those who are cutting be expressed\nin different views; some turning their backs, some their sides, and\nothers be seen in front; varying in the same manner the three different\nways of fighting, so that all the actions may have a relation to those\nthree principles.In battles, complex motions display great art, giving\nspirit and animation to the whole.By complex motion is meant, for\ninstance, that of a single figure shewing the front of the legs, and at\nthe same time the profile of the shoulder.But of this I shall treat in\nanother place[31].CLV./--_Of a single Figure separate from an historical Group._\n\n\n/The/ same motion of members should not be repeated in a figure which\nyou mean to be alone; for instance, if the figure be represented\nrunning, it must not throw both hands forward; but one forward and the\nother backward, or else it cannot run.If the right foot come forward,\nthe right arm must go backward and the left forward, because, without\nsuch disposition and contraste of parts, it is impossible to run well.If another figure be supposed to follow this, one of its legs should\nbe brought somewhat forward, and the other be perpendicular under the\nhead; the arm on the same side should pass forward.But of this we\nshall treat more fully in the book on motion[32].CLVI./--_On the Attitudes of the human Figure._\n\n\n/A painter/ is to be attentive to the motions and actions of men,\noccasioned by some sudden accident.He must observe them on the spot,\ntake sketches, and not wait till he wants such expression, and then\nhave it counterfeited for him; for instance, setting a model to weep\nwhen there is no cause; such an expression without a cause will be\nneither quick nor natural.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.But it will be of great use to have observed\nevery action from nature, as it occurs, and then to have a model set in\nthe same attitude to help the recollection, and find out something to\nthe purpose, according to the subject in hand.CLVII./--_How to represent a Storm._\n\n\n/To/ form a just idea of a storm, you must consider it attentively in\nits effects.When the wind blows violently over the sea or land, it\nremoves and carries off with it every thing that is not firmly fixed\nto the general mass.The clouds must appear straggling and broken,\ncarried according to the direction and the force of the wind, and\nblended with clouds of dust raised from the sandy shore.Branches and\nleaves of trees must be represented as carried along by the violence\nof the storm, and, together with number", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Trees and grass must be bent to the ground, as if\nyielding to the course of the wind.Boughs must be twisted out of their\nnatural form, with their leaves reversed and entangled.Of the figures\ndispersed in the picture, some should appear thrown on the ground, so\nwrapped up in their cloaks and covered with dust, as to be scarcely\ndistinguishable.Of those who remain on their feet, some should be\nsheltered by and holding fast behind some great trees, to avoid the\nsame fate: others bending to the ground, their hands over their faces\nto ward off the dust; their hair and their clothes flying straight up\nat the mercy of the wind.The high tremendous waves of the stormy sea will be covered with\nfoaming froth; the most subtle parts of which, being raised by the\nwind, like a thick mist, mix with the air.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.What vessels are seen should\nappear with broken cordage, and torn sails, fluttering in the wind;\nsome with broken masts fallen across the hulk, already on its side\namidst the tempestuous waves.Some of the crew should be represented as\nif crying aloud for help, and clinging to the remains of the shattered\nvessel.Let the clouds appear as driven by tempestuous winds against\nthe summits of lofty mountains, enveloping those mountains, and\nbreaking and recoiling with redoubled force, like waves against a rocky\nshore.The air should be rendered awfully dark, by the mist, dust, and\nthick clouds.CLVIII./--_How to compose a Battle._\n\n\n/First/, let the air exhibit a confused mixture of smoke, arising from\nthe discharge of artillery and musquetry, and the dust raised by the\nhorses of the combatants; and observe, that dust being of an earthy\nnature, is heavy; but yet, by reason of its minute particles, it is\neasily impelled upwards, and mixes with the air; nevertheless, it\nnaturally falls downwards again, the most subtle parts of it alone\ngaining any considerable degree of elevation, and at its utmost height\nit is so thin and transparent, as to appear nearly of the colour of\nthe air.The smoke, thus mixing with the dusty air, forms a kind of\ndark cloud, at the top of which it is distinguished from the dust by a\nblueish cast, the dust retaining more of its natural colour.On that\npart from which the light proceeds, this mixture of air, smoke, and\ndust, will appear much brighter than on the opposite side.The more the\ncombatants are involved in this turbulent mist, the less distinctly\nthey will be seen, and the more confused will they be in their lights\nand shades.Let the faces of the musketeers, their bodies, and every\nobject near them, be tinged with a reddish hue, even the air or cloud\nof dust; in short, all that surrounds them.This red tinge you will\ndiminish, in proportion to their distance, from the primary cause.The\ngroups of figures, which appear at a distance between the spectator\nand the light, will form a dark mass upon a light ground; and their\nlegs will be more undetermined and lost as they approach nearer to the\nground; because there the dust is heavier and thicker.If you mean to represent some straggling horses, running out of the\nmain body, introduce also some small clouds of dust, as far distant\nfrom each other as the leap of the horse, and these little clouds will\nbecome fainter, more scanty, and diffused, in proportion to their\ndistance from the horse.That nearest to his feet will consequently be\nthe most determined, smallest, and the thickest of all.Let the air be full of arrows, in all directions; some ascending, some\nfalling down, and some darting straight forwards.The bullets of the\nmusketry, though not seen, will be marked in their course by a train\nof smoke, which breaks through the general confusion.The figures in\nthe fore-ground should have their hair covered with dust, as also their\neyebrows, and all parts liable to receive it.The victorious party will be running forwards, their hair and other\nlight parts flying in the wind, their eyebrows lowered, and the motion\nof every member properly contrasted; for instance, in moving the right\nfoot forwards, the left arm must be brought forwards also.If you make\nany of them fallen down, mark the trace of his fall on the slippery,\ngore-stained dust; and where the ground is less impregnated with blood,\nlet the print of men's feet and of horses, that have passed that\nway, be marked.Let there be some horses dragging the bodies of their\nriders, and leaving behind them a furrow, made by the body thus trailed\nalong.The countenances of the vanquished will appear pale and dejected.Their\neyebrows raised, and much wrinkled about the forehead and cheeks.The tip of their noses somewhat divided from the nostrils by arched\nwrinkles terminating at the corner of the eyes, those wrinkles being\noccasioned by the opening and raising of the nostrils; the upper\nlips turned up, discovering the teeth.Their mouths wide open, and\nexpressive of violent lamentation.One may be seen fallen wounded\non the ground, endeavouring with one hand to support his body, and\ncovering his eyes with the other, the palm of which is turned towards\nthe enemy.Others running away, and with open mouths seeming to cry\naloud.Between the legs of the combatants let the ground be strewed\nwith all sorts of arms; as broken shields, spears, swords, and the\nlike.Many dead bodies should be introduced, some entirely covered\nwith dust, others in part only; let the blood, which seems to issue\nimmediately from the wound, appear of its natural colour, and running\nin a winding course, till, mixing with the dust, it forms a reddish\nkind of mud.Some should be in the agonies of death; their teeth shut,\ntheir eyes wildly staring, their fists clenched, and their legs in a\ndistorted position.Some may appear disarmed, and beaten down by the\nenemy, still fighting with their fists and teeth, and endeavouring\nto take a passionate, though unavailing revenge.There may be also a\nstraggling horse without a rider, running in wild disorder; his mane\nflying in the wind, beating down with his feet all before him, and\ndoing a deal of damage.A wounded soldier may also be seen falling to\nthe ground, and attempting to cover himself with his shield, while an\nenemy bending over him endeavours to give him the finishing stroke.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.Several dead bodies should be heaped together under a dead horse.Some\nof the conquerors, as having ceased fighting, may be wiping their faces\nfrom the dirt, collected on them by the mixture of dust with the water\nfrom their eyes.The _corps de reserve_ will be seen advancing gaily, but cautiously,\ntheir eyebrows directed forwards, shading their eyes with their hands\nto observe the motions of the enemy, amidst clouds of dust and smoke,\nand seeming attentive to the orders of their chief.You may also make\ntheir commander holding up his staff, pushing forwards, and pointing\ntowards the place where they are wanted.Was it possible that Ames--\n\n\"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say\nhe has quite conquered his--his--\"\n\n\"You mean, he's no longer a sot?\"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!\"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and\nthat the--that girl--did it,\" stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His\nhead slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus\nenwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone\nwith his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his\nmad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of\nabsolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the\nrealm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose\nideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of\ncountless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he\nhad made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the\nbitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross\nhewers of wood and drawers of water.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.Looking, and knowing not that in\ntheir piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer\nof the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission\nfor the man to enter.Ames,\" the clerk began, \"I--I have come to ask a favor--a\ngreat favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in\nsecuring stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is\nwith myself.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to\nhire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how\nthese girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they\nare now, they can not live on that!Say,\nten or twelve dollars to start with?\"\"Why do you come to me with your request?\"\"Yes, sir, I know,\" replied the young man with hesitation.\"But--I--did\nspeak to him about it, and--he refused.\"\"I can do nothing, sir,\" returned Ames in a voice that chilled the\nman's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire\nstenographers at that criminal wage!\"\"Very well, sir,\" replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon\nitself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since\nshadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young\ngirl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her\npath crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her\nreflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,\nexposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before\nher advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's\ntable and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she\ncame that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets\nto draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the\nworst financial panic it had known in years.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.And so shrewdly had they\nplanned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a\ntime when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it\nthrough.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and\ntransformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United\nStates would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in\nessence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this\ngreat country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as\nbut a sort of _opera bouffe_.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.And he,\nwhen that war should end, would control navigation on the great\nMagdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the\nemerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless\nbroken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that\na thought.His trip to Washington had been\nexhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,\nand there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His\nphysician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be\ncareful--\n\nBut why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,\nin all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,\nher portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there\nfacing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor\ntrace of hate.No; but always she\nsmiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to\nsay, \"You would destroy me, but yet I love you.\"Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his\nmethods.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,\nwould have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he\nadmired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her\nloyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,\nthat thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not\nreal!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that\nwoestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward\nhim--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive\nagain!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It\nwas unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that\nhe was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what\na blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other\nghastly sights!He would speak to her--\n\nBut--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair\nand--\n\nHer white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right\nthrough them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when\nher accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand\nupon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to\nrise--to break away--\n\nAnd then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he\nawoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead.\"A--a little tired, that's\nall, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk.\"There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he\nseemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face\ndrew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without\nexamining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the\npieces into the waste basket.\"Wire Pillette at\nonce to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the\nagitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me\nready!\"CHAPTER 14\n\n\nThe immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs\nmight have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private\nelevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,\nand turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his\noffice above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his\nluxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen\nhim sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep\nthought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate\ngave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and\nbent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now\ndimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,\nsubtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of\nemotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were\nbut just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic\nsoul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself\nweak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among\nthe strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could\nnot define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that\ndull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout\nhis mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged\nthings of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp\noutlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as\nhe sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the\ngirl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an\ninterrogation, even the eternal question, \"What shall it profit a\nman--?\"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had\ndone?To\nstand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew\nhis tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most\ndaring things he had ever seen a woman do.\"Isn't it funny,\" she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical\nlittle smile, \"that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit\ndown!\"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a\nmoment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close\nto him.\"You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?\"she\nsaid sweetly, looking up into his face.\"I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected\npleasure,\" he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,\nwhile the great wonder retained possession of him.\"Well,\" she went on lightly, \"will you believe me when I tell you that\nI have come here because I love you?\"So this was an attack from\na different quarter!<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,\neh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been\nshedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion\ndead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so\nlovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his\nhellish thought.\"You know,\" she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, \"I\njust had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys\nto get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you\nwould have refused to see me, wouldn't you?\"\"If I\nhad known you were out there,\" he said more gently, \"I'd have sent out\nand had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and\nnow I am sure it was--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, \"you wanted\n_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to\noppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus\ngave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to\npieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Well, that's the way I've been doing with\nyou--just loving you.\"The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed\nin the face from which he could not take his eyes?And\nyet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?\"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster.\"After all,\nthere was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon\nhis.\"It's the _real_ you that I love,\" she answered gently.\"The monster\nis only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help\nyou,\" she added brightly.\"You're going to put off the 'old man'\ncompletely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting\nin a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,\nMiss Wall, the Express, nor herself.\"You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised\nsome day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the\nway human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person\nan injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right\naway--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some\nday, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a\nperson, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It\njust brings loads of good with it.Ames,\" she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,\n\"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,\neven if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful\ndelusion!\"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of\nthings true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses\nlaid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the\nChrist was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The\nrestriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the\nbenign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not\ndesire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped\nwithin his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon\nthe words of Hood.\"They are very bitter against me--they hate me!\"\"They reflect in kind your thought of\nthem.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference\nwhich you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do\nyou know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that\nanother's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to\nmeet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing\nalkaloid.\"\"Love is--weakness,\" he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole\nuniverse as love!\"We argue from different\nstandpoints,\" he said.\"I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded\nbusiness man.\"And that,\" she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, \"is why\nbusiness is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,\nfear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you\nhaven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?\"Then, brightly, \"I am in business,\nMr.The business of\nattempting to annihilate me!\"\"I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,\"\nshe gently corrected.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.\"Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from\nmeddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me\nalone.\"\"Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of\nthe Express.\"I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,\neh?\"he continued, as he laid the papers before her.\"No, not at all,\" she promptly replied.\"That's uncovering evil, so's\nit can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your\nbusiness, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the\nlight, so that it can be--\"\n\n\"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I\nown--\"\n\n\"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you\noppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national\nownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.\"And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I\nsuppose?\"All our\npresent troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come\nfrom a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding\nof what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are\nvery foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think\nso?\"You see,\" she went on, while he sat studying her, \"those poor people\ndown at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you\ndo.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false\npleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of\nthe so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of\nvice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then\nyou turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the\nBible says--poor, deluded fools.\"\"Well, I'll be--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't swear!\"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up\ninto his face.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.\"It's time you started to prove God,\" she said earnestly.\"Won't you\nbegin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very\nstupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time\nto learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you\naren't obliged to work for a living.\"She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her\nsoft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked\ninto his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,\ncame from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long\ndormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long\nentrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet\nlearned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his\never-open mentality.And to those\nwhich savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with\nhimself as a willing tool.He thought her the most\ngloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before\nhim, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of\nOphir could not have bought.Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears.\"Don't you think,\" he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer\nto her, \"that we have quite misunderstood each other?\"But,\" with a happy smile\nagain lighting her features, \"we can understand each other now, can't\nwe?\"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,\ninstead of continuing to oppose each other?\"\"I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from\nWashington.I am--I--\"\n\n\"We need each other, don't we?\"the artless girl exclaimed, as she\nbeamed upon him.\"I can help\nyou--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,\nlittle girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind that!\"\"We are living in the\npresent, you know.\"And I\nwant to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little\none.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either.\"We're going to\nforget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?\"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got\na plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that\nbelongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is\nrightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all\nabout.I told you this once before, you may remember.\"He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames,\" she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,\n\"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.\"\"We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And\nMadam Beaubien shall have no further trouble.\"Sidney shall come home--\"\n\nWith a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent\nsuccess of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms\nabout his neck.\"Oh,\" she cried, \"it is love that has done all this!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel\nthe quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his\ncheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift\nof the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.For a fleeting interval\nthe man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise\nwithin him.\"Yes,\" he murmured gently, \"we'll take him to our home with us.\"Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and\nstepped back.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.she murmured, searching his face for the\nmeaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her\nhand.Not now--no, you\nneedn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making\nme over!Don't--\"\n\nCarmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment\nupon her face, was moving toward the door.\"Oh, I didn't know,\" she\nmurmured, \"that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!\"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything\nin the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be\nmy little wife!<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.\"I know--I know,\" he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood\nseemingly rooted to the floor, \"there is a great difference in our\nages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages\njust as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the\nExpress, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say\nfor the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon\nyou!\"<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.Carmen turned and came slowly back to him.\"And--you will not do these\nthings--unless I marry you?\"she said in a voice scarcely above a\nwhisper.\"I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!\"\"But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I\nrefuse--then what?\"\"It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within\nthe next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!\"\"But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?\"\"I've put it all into your hands,\" he answered shortly.Then\nshe glanced about in helpless bewilderment.\"I--I--love--you,\" she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,\nbut with unseeing eyes.\"I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_\nlove.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and\nbursting into tears.Taking her by the hand he led her,\nunresisting, back to her chair.\"Listen,\" he said, bending toward her.\"Go home now and think it\nall over.It was sudden, I admit; I\ntook you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the\naccomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and\nanother lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which\nhas changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again\nshe smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes.\"It's all right now,\" she murmured.\"It was all right all the\ntime--and I was protected.\"\"Some day,\" she said gently, and in a voice\nthat trembled just a little, \"you will help the people of Avon, but\nnot because I shall marry you.\"Then you refuse my offer, do you?\"\"Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated\nhim from the mask which he had worn.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Her glance penetrated until it\nfound his soul.\"You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind,\" she slowly replied.\"The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day\nto--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him.\"He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,\na letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your\npriestly lover, eh?\"She looked down at the letter which he held.\"It is money,\" she said,\nthough her thought seemed far away.\"Money that I am sending to a\nlittle newsboy who bears his name.\"He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound\nbook, he held it out to the girl.\"Here's a\nlittle piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your\nclerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you,\" bending over\nclose to her ear, \"his _life_!\"She staggered\na few steps toward the door, then stopped.\"God--is--is--_everywhere_!\"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15\n\n\nIf additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were\nrequired, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter\nmust furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "The\nman-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void\nwhich separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class\ninsolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry\naimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper\nwith each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder\nthe conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping\nin a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked\nthe typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested\nopposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer\nand thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has\never been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human\nhatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,\nand called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever\nseen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of\nlove upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a\nnation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that\nthey, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common\nbirthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know\nthe meaning of love?Oh, not by the\nhypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to\ntheir Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to\norder the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor\nvictims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them\nthat evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of\nknowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the\nChrist-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its\nomnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the\nlove that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,\nbetter concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of\nthe walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the\narrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's\noffice.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He\nhad never before seen her face colorless.\"What work have you--for me--to-day?\"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the\nwords, \"I--I have been with--a friend.\"Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment.\"How does it happen you're out riding with\nWillett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.\"Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and\nstarted for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the\ndoor she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in\ntears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took\nthe girl's hand and led her back to his own chair.\"Now, little one,\"\nhe said gently, \"tell me all about it.\"Then the tears began to flow; and then she\nleaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken\nmother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does\nthe strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the\nMan of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that\ncruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the\nwickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far\nfrom him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his\nanxious face.\"It's all past now,\" she said brokenly.\"Jesus forgave them that\nkilled him.And--\"\n\n\"You have been with--Ames?\"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone.\"He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as\nyet he has no spiritual understanding.\"Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It\ndidn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I\nfell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness.\"But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?\"persisted Hitt, his face dark\nwith anger.Ames only as--as God's child,\" she\nmurmured.\"Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to\nwork--work as I never did before!_I must!_\"\n\n\"Will you not tell me more about it?\"he asked, for he knew now that a\ndeadly thrust had been made at the girl's life.\"It didn't happen,\" was her\nreply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence\nupon the nothingness of death.\"Carmen,\" he asked, \"did he tell you\nthat--some one had died?\"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no\none but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to\nhim and kissed her forehead.\"It shall be as you wish, little one,\" he\nsaid in a choking voice.This is another\nopportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart.\"There is work to be done\nnow,\" he said.\"I wonder--\"\n\nShe took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she\nbecame calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love.\"Oh, they\nhave gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!\"\"I thought so,\" he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will\nsay nothing of--of your visit to his father.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd\nmight come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and\nrequesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later\nthe little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and\nSidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of\nmorning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below\nthe horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further\nclaims to the lives and fortunes of men.\"I have asked you here,\" Hitt gravely announced when they were\nassembled, \"to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God\nalone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message.\"He\nopened the paper which he held in his hand and read:\n\n  \"'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,\n  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses\n  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,\nlike the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,\nstarted from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with\ncanny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the\ndarkness of the carnal mind.\"I see in this,\" he said slowly, \"the\nculmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my\noil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice.\"The Express has stood before the world as a\npaper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of\nevil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,\nbought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant\nbrushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,\nsenators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could\nyou know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,\nhas tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,\nand entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the\nlegalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's\nmanhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has\nfought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted\nbrewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to\nthe world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his\nclique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of\nmartyrdom!\"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time.Its\ngrowth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the\nrevenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam\nBeaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I\ndoubt not, completely removed that source of income.\"\"But,\" exclaimed Haynerd, \"your property was insured, wasn't it?\"\"Yes,\" replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile.\"But with the\nproviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will\nnote that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my\npolicies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with\nthe insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised\nthat I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the\ninsurance?And I shall find myself with a big\nlawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's\nwork, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing\nhis suit for libel.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.\"But you told us you were going to mortgage your property,\" said Miss\nWall.\"I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent\nlittle boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet,\" he\nreturned.\"Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!\"\"Can you say that, after all you have\nendured, Carmen?\"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder.\"An outcast babe,\" he\nmurmured, \"left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared\nwithout knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly\nthreatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out\ninto an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to\nadvance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the\nfoulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at\nher feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even\nthough knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of\nwar, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door\nof the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the\nknowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son\nin distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of\nthe little lad; and now, this morning--\" He stopped, for he remembered\nhis promise.\"This morning,\" she finished, \"shielded by the One who is both Father\nand Mother to me.\"\"That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--\"\n\n\"He does,\" she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear.\"Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do,\" replied the\ngirl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it\na Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire\nfourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last\ntwo verses of the eighth chapter of Romans.\"Now,\" she said, looking up, \"we know what we are going to do, don't\nwe?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men\nlike Mr.\"There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any\ndepartment of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;\nand we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now\nwe are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there\nthat we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a\nvery different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the\nwilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we\nshall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that\nthere is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet\nit, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply\nitself that really creates the demand_!\"\"Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is\nour Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of\nthe infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling\nto the divine Mind that is God for guidance.\"Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket.\"Are you going\nto Avon to-morrow?\"\"And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,\nwithout one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant\nsorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I\nseemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again\nnow!\"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to\nCarmen.\"That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come,\" he added,\nbeckoning to Haynerd, \"the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,\nand we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!\"He\nturned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the\npiano.\"Don't,\" he said, \"if you do not feel like it.This day has been a\nhard one for you, I know.And--\"\n\n\"But I do feel like it,\" she answered, smiling up at him.And,\" her voice dropped low, \"I want to sing to--Him.\"Hitt gulped down something in his throat.\"The bravest little girl in\nthe whole wide world!\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of\ndefinite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless\ntrain of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of\nstarvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life\nis at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of\nthe first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following\nAmes's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind\nthem and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a\ndollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of\nthe bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself\nproved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:\n\"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate.\"In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and\nred, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the\nbrothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems\ntwine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,\n\"the man-killer from the beginning,\" waters their roots and makes\nfallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the\ngardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these\nnoxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,\nhave waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he\ngained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The\nworld was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with\nthe whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball\nweighted to drop where he might direct.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.He carried millions on margin,\nand with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions\nof his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of\ntheir honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each\nyear, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this\nas casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less\nthought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had\never really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings\nwere wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a\nbusiness man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than\nhuman flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting\nphilosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have\nbeen so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and\nhis life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these\nswarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,\nhe would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The\neight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the\nSupreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill\nhands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their\ncommon good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who\nshould be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered\nviolence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism\nwithin the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of\nthe whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got\nin touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal\nhenchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which\nthe great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the\nofficers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were\nhard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in\nall his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights\nwere of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general\npolicy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association\nthroughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop\nwas instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his\ninfluence was pernicious.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.But the objection was made that the priest\nwas engaged only in humanitarian labors.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.It availed not; Ames desired\nthe man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had\nbeen doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into\ncourt and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be\nprecipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of\naltering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,\nAmes ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon\ntenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the\nraise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement\nof this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the\nnight, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a\nknife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and\nhe had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous\ntask.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among\nthese hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation\nhad gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to\nawaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the\ncolumns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting\nthe responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and\nto a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a\ncotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did\nhe omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of\nejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,\nwith loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the\nmiserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts\nthat nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than\none tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab\nafternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just\nabove the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the\nsnow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,\ntoil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his\ninsatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his\nthin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one\nfrenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine\nright of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only\nto be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of\ncrimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see\nPillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these\nwere that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves\nwould show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains\nfrom their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,\nfor it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires\nbuilt along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;\nand the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate\nshelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,\nand into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the\nblizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen\nlight, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,\ncircling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and\npower with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled\nout into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main\nthoroughfare.Their low\ncurses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of\npent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything\nto destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of\nmaddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to\nthe cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by\narmfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great\nbarrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The\npolice gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before\nthe human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,\nincoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,\nthe carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,\nthe resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron\nfence, like hungry dock rats.On up the\nbroad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,\nand in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies\nover reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked\nroof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,\nprotestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his\nwife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who\nbear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,\nand fight his battles.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.So ye fought in the great war between North and\nSouth, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his\nmoney bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he\nturns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous\nprivilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great\nnation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.Will ye once more set up\nthe golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again\nenthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin\nand Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and\nbend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But\nthink you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a\nmillionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not\neffect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our\n\"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to\natoms.\"But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall\nwe know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and\nflowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and\nprescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled\nrestraint.Down into the creek\nbottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up\nthe far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the\ngreat mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their\nleaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the\nbuildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the\nravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with\ndesperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, \"The hour of departure has\narrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last\nhours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all\nhuman philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart\nof hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of\nhuman exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls\nof the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in\nwithering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling\nloved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the\nsteel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great\nmetropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the\nquivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager\nmilitiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames\nmills were private property.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master\nsat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they\nstrained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm\nand determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at\nAlbany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He\nhad received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family\nwith a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression\nof black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the\nNew York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his\nproperty, and specified that the bullets used should be of the\n\"dum-dum\" variety.Such\nbullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was\ntrue.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had\npurchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the\nmilitia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And\nthen, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and\nCollins into the United States District Court and persuaded the\nsitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief\ncommittees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the\nindustrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung\nbefore his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had\nspurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that\nhad crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil\nwithin him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.From the first she had\naroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never\nknown before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at\nthe opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless\neyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess\nthat fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his\ngrasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she\ntold him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had\nits price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin\nwith despair.And\nwith it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though\nwith foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden\nevery tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his\nthought forever more.And:\n\n              \"----with hope, farewell fear,\n              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;\n              Evil, be thou my good!\"And that night the master slept\nnot, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and\nplotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his\nworldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final\nruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not\nbecome his toy.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system\nupon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that\nsystem is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of\nthat poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up\nfrom the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles\nunslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they\ndragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a\nminute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill\ngroup, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch\nof the way.The air was thick with powder\nsmoke.The roar of battle was\ndeafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen\nstream.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in\nthe work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make\nheadway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long\nbuilding.Then, the building\nsaved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task\nof arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The\ntown had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the\nmilitia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong\ncordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had\nhastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of\na detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional\nsurrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along\nthe dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the\nvictim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping\nwives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the\nfrozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed\nmates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,\nhard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked\nout in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the\nslippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at\nthe side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these\nbewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own\nbreast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved\nmothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender\nwords of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they\nhad called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the\nAngel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more.\"Take me,\" she said, \"take me into court, and let me tell all.\"This beautiful, well-clad girl among\nsuch miserable vermin!The major's", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "He could make nothing\nout of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the\ngirl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away\nunder guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in\nhand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could\ncomprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the\ngirl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous\ninjuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous\nreturn fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine\nguns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them\nfell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the\ngirl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a\nmoment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the\nparalyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping\nstrokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the\nlittle camp below.The tents\ncaught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men\ndropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed\nhither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the\nmerciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,\nand then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering\nbodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,\nAmes, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is\ndone among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between\nthem and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and\nstark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office\nof the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest\nconversation with Haynerd.\"Yes,\" the editor was saying, \"I had a mortgage placed on the Express\nto-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate\nthe policy of the paper.He's still\nfighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the\nKetchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt\nby Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that\nCarmen--\"\n\n\"Yes; what about her?\"\"That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.\"\"And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to\nutterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her\nassociation with the Express.\"No word from her since we got the news of\nthe massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you\nthink?\"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Then Carmen herself\ncame through the open door.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Both men rose with exclamations of\ngladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted\nsmile had gone.Hitt,\" she said, \"I want a thousand dollars to-night.\"Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard.\"I must go back to Avon to-morrow,\" she announced.\"And the money is\nfor the--the people down there.\"Her voice caught, and her words\nstumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and\ntook her hand.\"Tell us,\" he said, \"about the trouble there to-day.\"\"No,\" she said, \"we will not talk about evil.A thousand--\"\n\n\"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen,\" he replied\ngravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that\nmorning.\"Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank\nwhen I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.\"\"But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than\nthat amount do you?\"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,\nthen this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He\ntook out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to\nthe girl.\"Hitt,\" said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted\nhis protests over the size of the check, \"something's killing that\ngirl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!\"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,\nand Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in\nprogress at Avon.A\nsocial and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to\nstarve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a\nhandful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest\ncentury as hopelessly insane!\"\"Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice\nfor a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few\nmay be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of\nthe minds of men?\"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are\nsuffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves\nonly, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed\nthem to monopolize the country's resources.Future\ngenerations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse\nis there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be\njuggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to\nbe considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on\nfoodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling\nthe supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the\npoor washerwoman starves?The\nexistence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof\npositive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our\nreligion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in\nasylums!\"<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk there.\"A considerable peroration, Ned,\" smiled Hitt.\"And yet, one that I\ncan not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the\nmental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are\nthe very worst offenders!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at\nAvon proves it, I think!\"\"Apparently so, Ned,\" returned Hitt sadly.\"And the only possibility\nof a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of\nwhat is really good and worth while.\"Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize\nthat nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely\neven begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,\nanyway?\"<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.\"Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling\ninfluence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.\"<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk there.\"And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal\nbusiness men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to\nemulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious\nmanhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he\nmade at Avon to-day!\"\"The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in\neverything except that which is worth while,\" replied Hitt.<|begin_of_text|>John took the milk there.\"But we\nhave been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate.\"Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--\"\n\n\"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.\"\"Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are\nan offense to me, sir!\"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with\nthe human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible\nthings within.\"Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands\ncrept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the\nsegregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go\nthrough the town to the Hall.He had\nslipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through\nthe day.She had gone first to the\nHall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little\ntown.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had\nasked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more\nintelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the\nmoney.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to\napprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay\nover Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody\nwork of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and\nhad made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,\nheavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the\nprisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and\nplaced under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest\nthreatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly\ngreeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great\nrevolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back\nhere!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.But soon he\nsprang to his feet.\"Come,\nmen, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,\ndon't buy of the company stores!\"\"We'll have to, Father,\" said one of them.\"But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know.\"Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But\nif we bought at other stores we were discharged.\"But now then, Miss\nCarmen, we'll begin.\"For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them\nout to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that\nat any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.\"Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as\nyou, its common people!Not on the rich,

guillotine, surrounded by faithful nobility, she may\nimagine herself again at Versailles.\"\"You call my brother a tyrant,\" the Princess replied to her accuser; \"if\nhe had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before\nyou!\"She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief.\"I am\nready to die,\" she said, \"happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better\nworld those whom I loved on earth.\"On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same\ntime as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and\nresignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and\ncourage like her own.The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace\nher, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted\nthe scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions\nhad been executed before her eyes.[Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at distant\nintervals during the course of ages; she set an example of steadfast piety\nin the palace of kings, she lived amid her family the favourite of all and\nthe admiration of the world....

Her last moments were worthy of her\ncourage and virtue.--D'HEZECQUES's \"Recollections,\" pp.\"It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from\nmy aunt,\" says Madame Royale.\"Since I had been able to appreciate her\nmerits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,\nand a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,\nsince nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.I never can\nbe sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended only\nwith her life.She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and loved\nher as a second mother.I was thought to be very like her in countenance,\nand I feel conscious that I have something of her character.Would to God\nI might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter deserve to meet\nher, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our Creator, where I\ncannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their virtuous lives and\nmeritorious deaths.\"Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her\naunt, or at least to know their fate.The municipal officers would tell\nher nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with\nher.\"I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often\nharshly refused,\" she says.I\nhad soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.I had no\nlight, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much.I had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.I\nhad also some knitting, 'qui m'ennuyait beaucoup'.\"Once, she believes,\nRobespierre visited her prison:\n\n[It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand of\nMademoiselle d'Orleans.It was also rumoured that Madame Royale herself\nowed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.\"The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not\nknow him, or at least would not tell me who he was.He stared insolently\nat me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in a\nsearch, retired.\"[On another occasion \"three men in scarfs,\" who entered the Princess's\nroom, told her that they did not see why she should wish to be released,\nas she seemed very comfortable!\"It is dreadful,' I replied, 'to be\nseparated for more than a year from one's mother, without even hearing\nwhat has become of her or of my aunt.'--'No, monsieur,\nbut the cruellest illness is that of the heart'--' We can do nothing for\nyou.Be patient, and submit to the justice and goodness of the French\npeople: I had nothing more to say.\"--DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME, \"Royal\nMemoirs,\" p.When Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young\nprisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration.\"He was\nalways courteous,\" she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh\nbooks, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, \"which\npleased me greatly.\"This simple expression of relief gives a clearer\nidea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of\ncomplaints.But however hard Madame Royale's lot might be, that of the Dauphin was\ninfinitely harder.Though only eight years old when he entered the\nTemple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; \"his memory\nretained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything.\"His\nfeatures \"recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the\nAustrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated\nnostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the\nmiddle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother\nbefore her years of tears and torture.All the beauty of his race, by\nboth descents, seemed to reappear in him.\"--[Lamartine]--For some time the\ncare of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the\nTemple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his\nsister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain\nstrength.\"What does the Convention intend to do with him?\"asked Simon, when the\ninnocent victim was placed in his clutches.For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better.\"Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his\nyouthful glory and his mother's pride.This worthy pair stripped him of\nthe mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it\n'playing at the game of the spoiled king.'They alternately induced him\nto commit excesses, and then half starved him.They beat him mercilessly;\nnor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.As soon as\nthe weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they would loudly\ncall him by name, 'Capet!Startled, nervous, bathed in\nperspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up, rush\nthrough the dark, and present himself at Simon's bedside, murmuring,\ntremblingly, 'I am here, citizen.'--'Come nearer; let me feel you.'He\nwould approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the treatment\nthat awaited him.Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick him away,\nadding the remark, 'Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted to know\nthat you were safe.'On one of these occasions, when the child had fallen\nhalf stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there groaning and\nfaint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, 'Suppose you were king,\nCapet, what would you do to me?'The child thought of his father's dying\nwords, and said, 'I would forgive you.'\"--[THIERS]\n\nThe change in the young Prince's mode of life, and the cruelties and\ncaprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his\nsister.\"Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large quantities\nof wine, which he detested.He grew extremely fat without\nincreasing in height or strength.\"His aunt and sister, deprived of the\npleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish voice raised\nin the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.The brutality of Simon\n\"depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.He called him the young\nwolf of the Temple.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.He treated him as the young of wild animals are\ntreated when taken from the mother and reduced to captivity,--at once\nintimidated by blows and enervated by taming.He punished for\nsensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he made the child\nwait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face with a knotted\ntowel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to strike him with it.\"[Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.He was involved in\nthe overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day after him, 29th\nJuly, 1794.]Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince's condition became even\nworse.His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any\nsuffering would have been preferable.\"He passed his days without any\nkind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.His\nkeepers never approached him but to give him food;\" and on the rare\noccasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable\nor unwilling to move about.When, in November, 1794, a commissary named\nGomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with\nkindness, it was too late.\"He took extreme care of my brother,\" says\nMadame Royale.\"For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in\ndarkness, and he was dying of fright.He was very grateful for the\nattentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him.\"But his physical\ncondition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin's representations, a\ncommission was instituted to examine him.\"The commissioners appointed\nwere Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited 'Louis Charles,' as he\nwas now called, in the month of February, 1795.They found the young\nPrince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some\ndirty cards, making card houses and the like,--the materials having been\nfurnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as evidences\nof indulgence.He did not look up from the table as the commissioners\nentered.He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the room was\nreported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh; his clothes\nwere also reported as new; but, in spite of all these assertions, it is\nwell known that his bed had not been made for months, that he had not left\nhis room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any purpose whatever, that it\nwas consequently uninhabitable, and that he was covered with vermin and\nwith sores.The swellings at his knees alone were sufficient to disable\nhim from walking.One of the commissioners approached the young Prince\nrespectfully.Harmond in a kind voice\nbegged him to speak to them.The eyes of the boy remained fixed on the\ntable before him.They told him of the kindly intentions of the\nGovernment, of their hopes that he would yet be happy, and their desire\nthat he would speak unreservedly to the medical man that was to visit him.He seemed to listen with profound attention, but not a single word passed\nhis lips.It was an heroic principle that impelled that poor young heart\nto maintain the silence of a mute in presence of these men.He remembered\ntoo well the days when three other commissaries waited on him, regaled him\nwith pastry and wine, and obtained from him that hellish accusation\nagainst the mother that he loved.He had learnt by some means the import\nof the act, so far as it was an injury to his mother.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.He now dreaded\nseeing again three commissaries, hearing again kind words, and being\ntreated again with fine promises.Dumb as death itself he sat before\nthem, and remained motionless as stone, and as mute.\"[THIERS]\n\nHis disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents\nof the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the\nmelancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: \"Little\nCapet is unwell.\"No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed\nnext day in more urgent terms: \"Little Capet is dangerously ill.\"Still\nthere was no word from beyond the walls.\"We must knock harder,\" said the\nkeepers to each other, and they added, \"It is feared he will not live,\" to\nthe words \"dangerously ill.\"At length, on Wednesday, 6th May, 1795,\nthree days after the first report, the authorities appointed M. Desault to\ngive the invalid the assistance of his art.After having written down his\nname on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.He made a long and\nvery attentive examination of the unfortunate child, asked him many\nquestions without being able to obtain an answer, and contented himself\nwith prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by spoonfuls every\nhalf-hour, from six o'clock in the morning till eight in the evening.On\nthe first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.In vain Gomin\nseveral times drank off a glass of the potion in his presence; his example\nproved as ineffectual as his words.Next day Lasne renewed his\nsolicitations.\"Monsieur knows very well that I desire nothing but the\ngood of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus refusing to take\nwhat might contribute to it.I entreat him as a favour not to give me\nthis cause of grief.\"And as Lasne, while speaking, began to taste the\npotion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of his hands.\"You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it,\" said he, firmly;\n\"well, give it me, I will drink it.\"From that moment he conformed with\ndocility to whatever was required of him, but the policy of the Commune\nhad attained its object; help had been withheld till it was almost a\nmockery to supply it.The Prince's weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him\nto the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step\nhe stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.At\nlast he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,\nand his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes\nin the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.But the\nslight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air scarcely\ncompensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.On the battlement of\nthe platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by perseverance\nthrough ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.The water that fell remained\nthere for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795, storms were of\nfrequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept constantly\nsupplied.Whenever the child was brought out upon the platform, he saw a\nlittle troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink and bathe in this\nreservoir.At first they flew away at his approach, but from being\naccustomed to see him walking quietly there every day, they at last grew\nmore familiar, and did not spread their wings for flight till he came up\nclose to them.They were always the same, he knew them by sight, and\nperhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that ancient pile.He\ncalled them his birds; and his first action, when the door into the\nterrace was opened, was to look towards that side,--and the sparrows were\nalways there.He delighted in their chirping, and he must have envied\nthem their wings.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral\nimprovement was taking place in him.He was touched by the lively\ninterest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at nine\no'clock every morning.He seemed pleased with the attention paid him, and\nended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.Gratitude loosened his\ntongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur, but kind\ntreatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he found them\nto express his thanks.M. Desault prolonged his visits as long as the\nofficers of the municipality would permit.When they announced the close\nof the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to allow a longer time,\nheld back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.Suddenly M. Desault's\nvisits ceased.Several days passed and nothing was heard of him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.The\nkeepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little invalid was much\ndistressed at it.The commissary on duty (M. Benoist) suggested that it\nwould be proper to send to the physician's house to make inquiries as to\nthe cause of so long an absence.Gomin and Larne had not yet ventured to\nfollow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was relieved by M. Bidault,\nwho, hearing M. Desault's name mentioned as he came in, immediately said,\n\"You must not expect to see him any more; he died yesterday.\"M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l'Humanite, was next\ndirected to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a\nstate that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the\nresponsibility alone.The physician--sent for form's sake to attend the\ndying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned\nbeforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed\nthe blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise\nof which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.That sound,\nwhich always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last\nmournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.M. Pelletan said\nauthoritatively to the municipal on duty, \"If you will not take these\nbolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our\ncarrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to\ntake charge of him.\"The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken\nas they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come\nnearer.\"Speak lower, I beg of you,\" said he; \"I am afraid they will hear\nyou up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,\nas it would give them much uneasiness.\"At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and\ngave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.Next day M.\nPelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a\ncolleague.M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l'Unite, made\nhis appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the\nofficial despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.They\nrepaired together immediately to the Tower.On their arrival they heard\nthat the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,\nwhich had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about\nnine o'clock.Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they\nperceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out\nby so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to\nsoften the last stage of this lamentable disease.While standing by the\nPrince's bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.\"My dear\nmother remains in the other tower.\"Night came,--his last night,--which\nthe regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,\nwith suffering, his old companion, only at his side.This time, however,\ndeath, too, stood at his pillow.When Gomin went up to the child's room\non the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and\nmute:\n\n\"I hope you are not in pain just now?\"\"Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so\nbeautiful!\"Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.Gomin, astonished, said to him, \"From what direction do you hear this\nmusic?\"And the\nchild, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his\nlarge eyes illuminated by delight.His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy\nthis last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,\nin intense rapture, \"Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of\nmy mother!\"<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.At a quarter past two he died, Lasne\nonly being in the room at the time.Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,\nthe commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber\nof death.The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into\nthat where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never\nceased to suffer.From this apartment the father had gone to the\nscaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.The remains\nwere laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set\nopen,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had\nseized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!At eight o'clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of\ngeneral safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really\ndead.When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont\nthey affected the greatest indifference.\"The event is not of the least\nimportance,\" they repeated, several times over; \"the police commissary of\nthe section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will\nacknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the\ncommittee will give the necessary directions.\"As they withdrew, some\nofficers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass\nwithout its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and\nnon-commissioned", "question": "Where is the milk?

Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with\nthe House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.Gomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the\nNational Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the\nminutes prepared by Darlot.This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up\nagain with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis\nXVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.\nJeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little\nfavourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries\nprepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse\nwas laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,\nand that they should proceed to the cemetery.It was the season of the\nlongest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy\nand at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took\nplace in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before\nthe gates of the Temple palace.One of the municipals wished to have the\ncoffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;\nbut M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the\narrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the\nprocession passed out through the great gate.The crowd that was pressing\nround was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured\nribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.Compassion and sorrow were\nimpressed on every countenance.A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,\nsent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.The bier,\nstill covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of\nfour men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or\neight men, headed by a sergeant.The procession was accompanied a long\nway by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the\ncemetery.The name of \"Little Capet,\" and the more popular title of\nDauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.Marguerite, not by the church, as\nsome accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.The interment\nwas made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet\nfrom the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,\nwhich subsequently served as a school.The grave was filled up,--no mound\nmarked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.Not\ntill then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,\nand enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of\ninterment.It was nearly nine o'clock, and still daylight.Release of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d'Angouleme.The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for\nwhom they had the deepest and most painful interest.After her brother's\ndeath the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.She was allowed\nto walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of\nthe old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several\ntimes evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths\nof her mother, aunt, and brother.Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had\nmuch difficulty in expressing her feelings.\"She spoke so confusedly,\"\nsays Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, \"that it was\ndifficult to understand her.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.It took her more than a month's reading\naloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself\nintelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression.\"She was\ndressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured\nby exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed\nto do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave\noff.When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with\na sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not\nlike to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.She suffered\nherself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and\nascetic habits.It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great\nchanges about to follow.Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded\nfor the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to\npray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.Names followed\nthis example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a\ncondition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be\nallowed to join her relations.At length the Convention decreed that\nMadame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and\nministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,\nSemonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.At midnight on 19th\nDecember, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from\nprison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting\npublic attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the\nTemple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.She made\nit her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her\nbrother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the\nfrontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of\nFrance, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named\nCoco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale\nreminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.Mesdames had beautiful spaniels;

and as she crossed the frontier she said to those around\nher, \"I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to consider it\nmy country.\"She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and her first\ncare was to attend a memorial service for her murdered relatives.After\nmany weeks of close retirement she occasionally began to appear in public,\nand people looked with interest at the pale, grave, slender girl of\nseventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose young head such\nterrible storms had swept.The Emperor wished her to marry the Archduke\nCharles of Austria, but her father and mother had, even in the cradle,\ndestined her hand for her cousin, the Duc d'Angouleme, son of the Comte\nd'Artois, and the memory of their lightest wish was law to her.Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to\npersecution.Every effort was made to alienate her from her French\nrelations.She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if\nLouis XVIII.A pressure of opinion\nwas brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a\ngirl.\"I was sent for to the Emperor's cabinet,\" she writes, \"where I\nfound the imperial family assembled.The ministers and chief imperial\ncounsellors were also present.When the Emperor invited me to\nexpress my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such\ninterests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother's\nrelatives, but also by those of my father.Besides, I said, I\nwas above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of\nFrance, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my\nfather, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would yield\nobedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.This declaration\nappeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and when they\nobserved that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my right being\nindependent of my will, my resistance would not be the slightest obstacle\nto the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt for the preservation\nof my interests.\"In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial\nrelations suppressed her French title as much as possible.When, with\nsome difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience of\nher, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and bade\nhim beware.\"Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de\nLorraine,\" she said, \"for here I am so identified with these\nprovinces--[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis\nXVIII.]<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.--that I shall end in believing in my own transformation.\"After\nthese discussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were\nimposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old\ndays of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the\nCzar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest's first request,\nwhatever it might be.Louis begged the Czar to use his influence with the\nCourt of Vienna to allow his niece to join him.\"Monsieur, my brother,\"\nwas Paul's answer, \"Madame Royale shall be restored to you, or I shall\ncease to be Paul I.\"Next morning the Czar despatched a courier to Vienna\nwith a demand for the Princess, so energetically worded that refusal must\nhave been followed by war.Accordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was\nallowed to leave the capital which she had found so uncongenial an asylum.In the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.and his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d'Angouleme\n\n[The Duc d'Angonleme was quiet and reserved.He loved hunting as means of\nkilling time;

and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage through a\ncrowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings attended them\non their way.The Duc d'Angouleme took another route\nto join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist cause.]The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his\ndominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully\nsurprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of the\nbody-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection of\nPaul.The \"mad Czar\" had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,\npenniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.All\nthe money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful\nservants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the Duchess\noffered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two thousand\nducats, saying she pledged her property \"that in our common distress it\nmay be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful servants, and\nmyself.\"The Duchess's consistent and unselfish kindness procured her\nfrom the King, and those about him who knew her best, the name of \"our\nangel.\"Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there\nthey were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon's attempt to threaten and bribe\nLouis XVIII.It was suggested that refusal might bring\nupon them expulsion from Prussia.\"We are accustomed to suffering,\" was\nthe King's answer, \"and we do not dread poverty.I would, trusting in\nGod, seek another asylum.\"In 1808, after many changes of scene, this\nasylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their\ndisposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.From Gosfield, the King moved to\nHartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee\nfor L 500 a year.A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled\nfamily by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty persons\nwere supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two dozen.At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst\nthe poor.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked\nthe notice of strangers.In March, 1814, the royalist successes at\nBordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and\namidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent himself\nto wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite left\nHartwell in April, 1814.The return to France was as triumphant as a\nsomewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most of\nsuch cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.As she\npassed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was vociferously\ngreeted.The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much longer-lived than\nthe applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had scarcely effected\none of the strongest wishes of her heart,--the identification of what\nremained of her parents' bodies, and the magnificent ceremony with which\nthey were removed from the cemetery of the Madeleine to the Abbey of St.Denis,--when the escape of Napoleon from Elba in February,1815, scattered\nthe royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.The Duc\nd'Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a\nSwedish vessel.The Comte d'Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de\nConde withdrew beyond the frontier.The\nDuchesse d'Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the\nProclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand\nagainst the general panic.Day after day she mounted her horse and\nreviewed the National Guard.She made personal and even passionate\nappeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a\nhandful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops\nwere on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against\nthe square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.[\"It was the Duchesse d'Angouleme who saved you,\" said the gallant General\nClauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer;

the Duchess issued a\nfarewell proclamation to her \"brave Bordelais,\" and on the 1st April,\n1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.During a\nbrief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was\nover, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the\nTuileries.She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State\nceremonies or Court gaieties.Her life was as secluded as her position\nwould allow.Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been\ninhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of\nher family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and\nprayed.In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the\nspot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule\nall her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she\nrefrained from doing.[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,\nthat one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from\nthe letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might\nbe melted down and sold;

the Duchesse d'Angouleme under the title of\nComtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her\nson, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till\nhis death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by\nhis enthusiastic people.Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy\nassociations, was their appointed dwelling.The Duc and Duchesse\nd'Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by\nland, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea.\"I prefer my route\nto that of my sister,\" observed the latter, \"because I shall see the coast\nof France again, and she will not.\"The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were\nstill too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,\nwith his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse\nd'Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.The family were reunited at\nPrague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated\nwith some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to\ncongratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of\nmonarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.Three years\nlater the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor\nFrancis II.was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to\nbe crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned\nmonarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.Illness and sorrow\nattended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were\nestablished in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of\ncholera, in his eightieth year.At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,\nthe Duchesse d'Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched\nover that of her husband.Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in\nyouth, but they respected each other's virtues, and to a great extent\nshared each other's tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very\nclosely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,\nriding, and reading together.When the Duchesse d'Angouleme had seen her\nhusband laid by his father's side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,\nshe, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they\nspent seven tranquil years.Here she was addressed as \"Queen\" by her\nhousehold for the first time in her life, but she herself always\nrecognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.The Duchess lived\nto see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of\nher family.Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.She tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service\nheld for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the\nanniversary of her execution.But her strength was not equal to the task;\non the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,\nand on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angouleme,\nwas buried in the Franciscan convent.\"In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was\npresent because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a\nFrench heart.had long been admitted to be one of\nthe most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.The Emperor Napoleon\nnever spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and\nalways prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.The ceremony to\nwhich I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of\nPrussia.It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot\non which Louis XVI.I went to see the\nceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,\nnext to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande.\"The expiation took place on the 10th of April.The weather was extremely\nfine and warm for the season.The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,\naccompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance\nof the Rue Royale;

and the principle business of these priests has been\nto boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put\ntogether.Gods with Back-Hair\n\nMan, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for\nthe fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the\nphysical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would\nhave been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,\nthey would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and\nback-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite\n\nAdmitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,\nof what did he create it?Nothing,\nconsidered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It\nfollows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,\nhe being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was\nmade of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in\nhis mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: \"Creation is the decomposition\nof the infinite.\"The Gods Are as the People Are\n\nNo god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s\nrepresented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian\ngave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.The Jews\nwere not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with\na full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect\nGreek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods\nof Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who\nmade them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the football there.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad\nin robes of fur;

the falling\nof sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by\nthese industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness\n\nIf a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he\ncommenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,\nduring which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this\nsupposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so\nto speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World\n\nOne of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,\nwith the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful\nand the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,\nthe most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever\nconceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom\nmen ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would\nleave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things\n\nFrom their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the\npurpose of imparting information to man.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.It is related of one that he\ncame amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that\nthey should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining\nabodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to\ninform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as\nto the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow\n\nNations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and\ndecay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them\nall.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities\nof one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature\n\nThe best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material\nnature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very\ninnocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to\nnature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that\nhe has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the\n\"Great First Cause.\"They say that matter cannot produce thought; but\nthat thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,\nand therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not\nsay, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence\ngreater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart\nfrom matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a\nbrain.Great Variety in Gods\n\nGods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to\nthe most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred\nheads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed\nwith clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some\nhave wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves\nentire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some\nwere foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some\ninto bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love\nto the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have\nbeen--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some\nhad children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as\ntheir fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,\nlustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for\ninformation, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller\n\n\"But,\" says the religionist, \"you cannot explain everything; and that\nwhich you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God.\"We are understanding more every day;\nconsequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due\n\nIf the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,\nto thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate\nof learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human\nears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of\nmodesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of\ncivilization.Casting out Devils\n\nEven Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed\nof evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of\nhis divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his\nunfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,\nand the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him\nas the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite\nfortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma\n\nThe history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages\nto avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers\nhave inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer\nof the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,\nman's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power\nsuperior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine\n\nHow are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove\nthat the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would\nknow a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will\nnot, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied\nthat I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten\nignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this\nworld with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that\nthere is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives\nsunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite \"Father\" allows a majority of his children to live in\nignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever\nimprove their condition?Can the conduct\nof infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable\nof any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the\nhabitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with\nferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world\nwith earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that\nit was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was\ncursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was\ndoomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an\napple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods\n\nOur ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils\nas well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These\ndevils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,\nmythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and\nmerciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order\nto kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such\nbarbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were\nsent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the\ndying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead\nmother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such\nfiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the\ndwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising\northodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that\nall the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally\ngoing to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist\nbarnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no\nheaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for\nmy liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my\nindividuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no\ndoor but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar\neven of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,\nand arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is\nnever touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,\nbeauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,\nand tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the\ntyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.Hope of a Future Life\n\nFor my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either\nbefore or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with\nanybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best\nway to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly\ncannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this\nworld.I would like to see how things come\nout in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to\nsee again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal\n\nSo far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't\nrecollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I\nwill remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions\nof dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be\nrich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our\nhope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all\nreligions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling\nus that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will\nrecollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,\nthey would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for\nthe purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden\nof Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to\nkeep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves\nanything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after\nthis; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There\nwere a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to\ntell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great\nextent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,\nfirst, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry\nthat we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,\nnext to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,\nnext to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death\nthe sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the\neverlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that\nhave been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word\nof grief.And I had\nrather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having\nreturned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of\nthe the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would\nrather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,\nbursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think\nof them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been\nclutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny\n\nMoses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure\nto say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to\nthreaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one\nword in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem\nit important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by\nrewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful\nrealities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people\nof his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their\norigin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born\n\nI honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering\neyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I\nbelieve it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling\nof wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the\nmalicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate\nit; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in\nthe night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the\nineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and\npaddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love\nand with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my\nrace.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to\nburn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell\n\nSince hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had\na thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with\nthe inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst\nman in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man\nin the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the\npuritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off\nmy harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will\nbe in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most\nof the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of\nman, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all\nthe writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best\nmusicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good\nstories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there\npermanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months\nthere.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the\nsubject.The husband is a good\nfellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and\nall at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night\nafter night around his bedside until their property is wasted and\nfinally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with\ntears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,\nand at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she\nattends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally\nhe dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the\ntears of agony and love.He dies, and\nshe buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in\nthe twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little\nboys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender\ntheir father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was\nnot a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over\nand sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and\nwhose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her\nin the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the\nleast.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine\nas that.The Drama of Damnation\n\nWhen you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no\nmatter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many\nwomen you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;\nbut if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see\nthrough the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked\ntongues of devils.For instance, it\nis the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording\nsecretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:\n\"Where are you from?\"\"Well, I don't like to talk about myself.\"\"Well, I was a good fellow; I loved\nmy wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my\nparadise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the\nfaces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one\nof them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,\nand I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want\nfrom the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am.\"They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was\nto be damned.\"To tell you the\nGod's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.\"\"Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian\nAssociation.\"\"Did you\never run off with any of the money?\"\"Did you take anything\nelse along with you?\"\"Did you have a wife and children of your own?\"\"Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I\nbelieved he would take care of them.\"I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were\nnot harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith\ncould do.\"Annihilation rather than be a God\n\nNo God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has\nno right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation\nthat will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make\na failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a\nconspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that\nasp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that\nnever dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I\nwould rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul\nwould have to suffer eternal agony.\"All that have Red Hair shall be Damned.\"I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I\nadmit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best\nthey can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are\nhurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can\nagainst their doctrines.They preach this infamy: \"He that believes\nshall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.\"Every word\nof that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that\ntext has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of\nman; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and\nthat infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that\n\"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be\ndamned.\"No man can control his belief; you might as well say, \"All that\nhave red hair shall be damned.\"The Conscience of a Hyena\n\nBut, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of\neternal punishment.That\ndoctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and\nmoral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That\ndoctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable\nto suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most\ninfinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man\nwho believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the\nheart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead\n\nBut for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever\nflower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot\nbelieve that there is any being in this universe who has created a\nsoul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy\nhimself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,\nto the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer\neternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an\naccount of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the\nsupernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting\nfrom the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know\nwithout visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.Jesus Christ\n\nAnd let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have\ninfinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has\ndied for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and\nserene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and\nmy tears.He was an infidel in his\ntime.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by\nhypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom\nout of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his\nfriend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than\nI will be.For the theological creation I have\na different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such\nthing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal\nopening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism\nto face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered\nhis wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he\nconvened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or\nthe son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with\nthe Father.We are thus indebted to a wife\nmurderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council\ndecided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,\nthe younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the\nVirgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that\nshe was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at\nChalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two\nnatures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held\nat Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided\nthat Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the\ncouncil of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,\nbut from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might\nhave been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into\nconsideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely\nessential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this\ndoctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions\nthat dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He\nthought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of\nignorance and fear.He was the father of a\ngreat party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He\nwas a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a\nuniversity, father of a political party, President of the United States,\na statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of\nhis day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the football.He had done these things openly, and what\nhe had said could not be answered.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.His arguments were so good that his\ncharacter was bad.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Angels at Constantino's Dying Bed!The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a\nChristian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of\ndeath.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered\nwith the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no\nshrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and\ntrembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled\nwith the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling\nrealms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no\nanathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and\nhis holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot\n\nDiderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the\nhumbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He\nhad in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a\nbeggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and\ngeneration a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,\nwas necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going\nfor days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was\ngenerous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man\nless willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, \"Incredulity\nis the first step toward philosophy.\"He had the vices of most\nChristians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His v", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "He attacked with\nevery power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal\neducation--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of\nthe whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from\nthe gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that\nthe child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree\nof knowledge.His poor little desk was\nransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something\nmight be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous\nman.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was\nregarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza\n\nOne of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,\nborn at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on\nwhat he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the\nterrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every\nJewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,\nafter the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not\neven speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty\nof Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old\nwhen he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully\ndivided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem\nof existence.According to him the universe did not commence to\nbe.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted\nthat God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine\n\nPoverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than\nbooks; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;\nmore strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no\nadmiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's\nsake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice\neverywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on\nthe throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the\nweak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers\n\nIn my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever\nlived.\"What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever\nwent together.\"Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of\npower, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of\nthings.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.Nothing short\nof the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to\nbe right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,\nnever for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words\nwere ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary\nsoldiers read the inspiring words of \"Common Sense,\" filled with ideas\nsharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause\nof Freedom.The Writings of Paine\n\nThe writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry\nconviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until\nthere was a government of the people and for the people.At the close\nof the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been\nwilling to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least\ncould have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there\nwould have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled\nwith hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a\nhypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite\nenough to visit him against his will.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Several of them he ordered\nfrom his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of\nhypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend\nof man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life\nblown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse\nthem both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just\nas the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered\nin the dull ear of the dying man: \"Do you believe, or do you wish to\nbelieve, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?\"And the reply was: \"I\nhave no wish to believe on that subject.\"These were the last remembered\nwords of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed\naway.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink\nand edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God\n\nThomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of\nthe founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his\nage.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of\nslavery.He wast in the widest and\nbest sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart\nwas good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was\nthe first man to write these words: \"The United States of America.\"He furnished every thought\nthat now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one\nGod and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he\nhoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera\n\nThomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom\nwe are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and\nhonored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better\nfor his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and\nreproach for his portion.His friends\nwere untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He\nlost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life\nis what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to\nlove your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of\nright--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your\nduty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the\nage of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land\nhis genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot\ntouch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary\nof the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson\n\nIn our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit\nof persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in\nevery colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of\nMaryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not\ninvestigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those\nwho denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not\nbased upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who\ndiffered in non-essential points.David Hume\n\nOn the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of\nthe few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had\nthe manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,\nand the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly\ncapable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm\nand cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,\nand devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After\nexamining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For\nfailing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate\nfalsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire\n\nVoltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at\nthe foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite\nin Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the\npioneer of his century.Through the\nshadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,\nthrough the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,\npast cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,\nhe carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin\n\nCalvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,\ngloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He\nwas a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,\nferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his\nhealth permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters\n\nThis man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total\ndepravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About\nthe neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron\npoints.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test\nof orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of\nyouth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,\nin union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian\ndoctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were\ncompelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this\nproceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great\nsatisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with\nCalvin.Humboldt\n\nHumboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were\nabandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought\nbecame courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the\nmonsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels\n\nEurope becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He\nsailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the\nPampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,\nmore than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed\non until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he\npursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid\nBonplandi.He was the best intellectual\norgan of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and\neloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every\nscience.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in\nunknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement\nof true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions\n\nHumboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,\nphilologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be\nregenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand\npatriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called\nthe Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a\nphilosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of\nromance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to\nhis countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,\nauthor of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,\nthe infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who\nfollowed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and\nof hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the\nscientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science\n\nUpon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the\nscientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the\ngreat demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed\nby law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain\nside--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the\ntropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his\neyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the\nmountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,\nhe looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.Not satisfied with\nhis discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes\nof\n\nSiberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at\nevery step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no\nleisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one\nof the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with\na self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that\nconstantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the\npolar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb\n\nA little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a\nmagnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and\ngazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last\nthe ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought\nabout the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him\nwalking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him\nat Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw\nhim at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of\nLodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows\nof the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of\nFrance with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and\nAusterlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the\ncavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered\nleaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million\nbayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw\nhim upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined\nto wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,\nwith his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn\nsea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that\nhad been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,\npushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would\nrather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather\nhave lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes\ngrowing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been\nthat poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day\ndied out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about\nme; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless\nsilence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial\nimpersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I\nwould, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine\n\nThis is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the\nRevolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with\nthe sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will\ndrink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call\nfor a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon\nthe field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the\nthroat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched\nthe mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man\nwho, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and\nchallenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like\nan armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the\nhalls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and\nfair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the\nmaligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant\nleader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the\nfield of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the\nbearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader\n\nThe Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this\nGovernment should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows\nthat any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its\nprotectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who\nbelieves in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;\nbut they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of\nmoral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in\nfull, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is\nthe present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.\nBlaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements\nof its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic\nof her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for\na man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain\nbeneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln\n\nThis world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty\nin it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the\nChristian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808\nthat England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests\nin her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave\nships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a\nman stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a\ncommon burglar or a horse thief.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple there.It was not until the 28th\nday of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and\nit was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by\ndirection of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;\nand I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in\nmy judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the\nUnited States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and\nI know of no other man deserving it so well as he: \"Here lies one who\nhaving been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on\nthe side of mercy.\"Swedenborg\n\nSwedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of\nhonest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,\nat least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by\nanalogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to\nother worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason\nand the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged\ngarment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong\nside, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham\n\nThe glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and\nfurnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: \"The\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number.\"Charles Fourier\n\nFourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg\ndid to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one\nwho solemnly asserts that \"the elephant, the ox and the diamond were\ncreated by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the\ncow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet\nand the opal stones by the earth itself.\"And yet, forgetting these\naberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for\none, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of\nthe best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte\n\nThere was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn\nof that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the\nonly God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,\nmistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only\nsavior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the\ndarkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet\nto be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything\nconnected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste\nComte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer\n\nHerbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon\nexperience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives\nthat there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond\nthat is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine\nonly that which is capable of being examined, and considers the\ntheological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is\nbut a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected\nthe condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and\nbelievers.Robert Collyer\n\nI have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have\nread with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain\nfull of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet\nand the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and\nJohn Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would\nhave extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of\nChicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly\ndivided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton\n\nEngland was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All\nreligious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy\nfanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had\nclothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had\nadded to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the\nProtestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put\nChrist in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works\nwere considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible\nitself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the\nhorrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel\n\nAmongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in\nGermany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said\nnot only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic\nconception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete\nsuccess--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,\nthe creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the\nchurch, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures\n\nProfessor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they\nhunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect\nfor Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is\ninspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot\n\nCompare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments\ngiven her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot\nwears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real\nworth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his\nplace.Bough on Rabbi Bien\n\nI will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has\ntaken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has\ntaken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest\nI ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just\nas good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an\nunappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all\nthe men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members\nof the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I\npronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield\n\nNo man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either\nparty, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He\nwas a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the\navocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew\nfrom his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the\navocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of\nprofound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for\na living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves\npeace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,\nrushes to the rescue of her flag.\"Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire.\"James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not\nmoney enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of\nJames A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you\nthat money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious\nrobe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in\nWall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I\nlike to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to\nsay it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in\nhonor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution\n\nGarfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says\nto every poor boy: \"All the avenues of honor are open to you.\"He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a\nsoldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if\nevery man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose\na hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas\n\nThe best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I\nregard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He\nis intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article\nbeing written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for\nnot being exactly fair.Thomas\nthe probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult\nto preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible\nrespect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect\nfairness.Heresy and Orthodoxy\n\nIt has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the\nhospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to\nflax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on\nthe sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the\ngrand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that\nis what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,\nand heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining\nforever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I\nmean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you\nshould keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should\nkeep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not\nlet the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a\nchance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,\nis, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning\nto see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man\nthat held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care\nnothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing\nup in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy\nthat has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test\n\nIf a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the\nworld, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but\nan ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined\nby lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not\ngenuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation\nis not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid\nto have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails\n\nWhy should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why\nshould barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand\nyears ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the\nsuperstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,\n\"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the\nfifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?\"How pleasing to\nGod this must have been.There may be a God\n\nThere may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,\nsome being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the\ninfinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing\nto say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no\nworship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker\nafter truth.The People are Beginning to Think\n\nThe people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,\npainfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only\nupon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to\ninterfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed\nto be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the\nproducts of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit\nthe business of producing famine.Unchained Thought\n\nFor the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the\nrealities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and\nachievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless\nliberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future\n\nIf abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man\nmust free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;\nif labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the\ndefenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must\nbe the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by\nman, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath\n\nOf all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the \"sacred\nSabbath\" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn\nand sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite\nbeing by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the\nperfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it\nexcite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,\ntalking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that \"sacred\" day.The\nearth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and\nbirds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about\ndeath, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom\ninstead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry\n\nFreethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to\nspend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day\nto put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,\nof love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea\n\nA poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of\nrest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife\nand child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength\nfor toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away\nfrom street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where\nshe can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the\nlong, glad day.Melancholy", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under\nthe old text, \"The evening and the morning were the first day.\"They\ncommenced then, I

concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said\nlastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model\n\nIt has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the\nfoundation of all ideas of justice and of law.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Eminent jurists have\nbowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to\nthe effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all\nideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such\nassertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians\nhad a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,\nlarceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement\nof contracts.A False Standard of Success\n\nIt is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a\nsuccess; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the\nputrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of\nsuccess.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that\nno fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,\nand he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They\nnever put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet\nslept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers\n\nYou can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,\nthe supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every\nman is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter\nif he occupies a throne.The laborers\nshould have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want\nevery farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain\nas his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was\nno such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every\nagricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his\nvocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the\nagriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the\nslave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History\n\nWhile reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and\nhorror.The alleged reclamation suppressed,\nthe certificate sent to Secretary Jefferson and to Paine, the American\nMinister is credited with having done his duty.In Washington's\nCabinet, where the technicalities of citizenship had become of paramount\nimportance, especially as regarded France, Deforgues' claim that Paine\nwas not an American must be accepted--Morris consenting--as final.It may be wondered that Morris should venture on so dangerous a game.But he had secured himself in anything he might choose to do.So soon as\nhe discovered, in the previous summer, that he was not to be removed,\nand had fresh thunderbolts to wield, he veiled himself from the\ninspection of Jefferson.This he did in a letter of September 22, 1793.In the quasi-casual way characteristic of him when he is particularly\ndeep, Morris then wrote: \"_By the bye, I shall cease to send you copies\nof my various applications in particular cases, for they will cost you\nmore in postage than they are worth_.\"I put in italics this sentence,\nas one which merits memorable record in the annals of diplomacy.The French Foreign Office being secret as the grave, Jefferson facile,\nand Washington confiding, there was no danger that Morris' letter to\nDe-forgues would ever appear.Although the letter of Deforgues,--his\ncertificate that Morris had reclaimed Paine as an American,--was a\nlittle longer than the pretended reclamation, postal economy did not\nprevent the American Minister from sending _that_, but his own was never\nsent to his government, and to this day is unknown to its archives.It cannot be denied that Morris' letter to De-forgues is masterly in its\nway.He asks the Minister to give him such reasons for Paine's detention\nas may not be known to him (Morris), there being no such reasons.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.He\nsets at rest any timidity the Frenchman might have, lest Morris should\nbe ensnaring him also, by begging--not demanding--such knowledge as he\nmay communicate to his government.Philadelphia is at a safe distance in\ntime and space.Deforgues is complacent enough, Morris being at hand,\nto describe it as a \"demand,\" and to promise speedy action on the\nmatter--which was then straightway buried, for a century's slumber.Paine was no doubt right in his subsequent belief that Morris was\nalarmed at his intention of returning to America.Should Paine ever\nreach Jefferson and his adherents, Gouverneur Morris must instantly lose\na position which, sustained by Washington, made him a power\nthroughout Europe.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Moreover, there was a Nemesis lurking near him.The\nrevolutionists, aware of his relations with their enemies, were only\nwithheld from laying hands on him by awe of Washington and anxiety about\nthe alliance.The moment of his repudiation by his government would have\nbeen a perilous one.It so proved, indeed, when Monroe supplanted him.For the present, however, he is powerful.As the French Executive\ncould have no interest merely to keep Paine, for six months, without\nsuggestion of trial, it is difficult to imagine any reason, save the\nwish of Morris, why he was not allowed to depart with the Americans, in\naccordance with their petition.Thus Thomas Paine, recognized by every American statesman and by\nCongress as a founder of their Republic, found himself a prisoner, and a\nman without a country.Outlawed by the rulers of his native land--though\nthe people bore his defender, Erskine, from the court on their shoulders\n--imprisoned by France as a foreigner, disowned by America as a\nforeigner, and prevented by its Minister from returning to the country\nwhose President had declared his services to it pre-eminent!Never dreaming that his situation was the work of Morris, Paine\n(February 24th) appealed to him for help.\"I received your letter enclosing a copy of a letter from the Minister\nof foreign affairs.You must not leave me in the situation in which\nthis letter places me.You know I do not deserve it, and you see the\nunpleasant situation in which I am thrown.I have made an essay in\nanswer to the Minister's letter, which I wish you to make ground of\na reply to him.They have nothing against me--except that they do not\nchoose I should be in a state of freedom to write my mind freely upon\nthings I have seen.Though you and I are not on terms of the best\nharmony, I apply to you as the Minister of America, and you may add to\nthat service whatever you think my integrity deserves.At any rate I\nexpect you to make Congress acquainted with my situation, and to send to\nthem copies of the letters that have passed on the subject.A reply to\nthe Minister's letter is absolutely necessary, were it only to continue\nthe reclamation.Otherwise your silence will be a sort of consent to his\nobservations.\"Supposing, from the French Minister's opening assertion, that a\nreclamation had really been made, Paine's simplicity led him into a\ntrap.He sent his argument to be used by the Minister in an answer of\nhis own, so that Minister was able to do as he pleased with it, the\nresult being that it was buried among his private papers, to be partly\nbrought to light by Jared Sparks, who is candid enough to remark on the\nMinister's indifference and the force of Paine's argument.Not a word to\nCongress was ever said on the subject.Jefferson, without the knowledge or expectation of Morris, had resigned\nthe State Secretaryship at the close of 1793.Morris' letter of March\n6th reached the hands of Edmund Randolph, Jefferson's successor, late in\nJune.On June 25th Randolph writes Washington, at Mount Vernon, that\nhe has received a letter from Morris, of March 6th, saying \"that he has\ndemanded Paine as an American citizen, but that the Minister holds him\nto be amenable to the French laws.\"Randolph was a just man and an exact\nlawyer; it is certain that if he had received a copy of the fictitious\n\"reclamation\" the imprisonment would have been curtailed.Under the\nfalse information before him, nothing could be done but await the\nstatement of the causes of Paine's detention, which Deforgues would\n\"lose no time\" in transmitting.It was impossible to deny, without\nfurther knowledge, the rights over Paine apparently claimed by the\nFrench government.And what could be done by the Americans in Paris, whom Paine alone had\nbefriended?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Joel Barlow, who had best opportunities of knowing the\nfacts, says: \"He [Paine] was always charitable to the poor beyond his\nmeans, a sure friend and protector to all Americans in distress that he\nfound in foreign countries; and he had frequent occasions to exert his\ninfluence in protecting them during the Revolution in France.\"They were\ngrateful and deeply moved, these Americans, but thoroughly deceived\nabout the situation.Told that they must await the action of a distant\ngovernment, which itself was waiting for action in Paris, alarmed by the\nAmerican Minister's hints of danger that might ensue on any misstep or\nagitation, assured that he was proceeding with the case, forbidden to\ncommunicate with Paine, they were reduced to helplessness.Meanwhile,\nbetween silent America and these Americans, all so cunningly disabled,\nstood the remorseless French Committee, ready to strike or to release in\nobedience to any sign from the alienated ally, to soothe whom no\nsacrifice would be too great.Genet had been demanded for the altar of\nsacred Alliance, but (to Morris' regret) refused by the American\ngovernment.The Revolution would have preferred Morris as a victim, but\nwas quite ready to offer Paine.Six or seven months elapsed without bringing from President or Cabinet a\nword of sympathy for Paine.But they brought increasing indications that\nAmerica was in treaty with England, and Washington disaffected towards\nFrance.Under these circumstances Robespierre resolved on the accusation\nand trial of Paine.It does not necessarily follow that Paine would\nhave been condemned; but there were some who did not mean that he should\nescape, among whom Robespierre may or may not have been included.The\nprobabilities, to my mind, are against that theory.Robespierre having\nceased to attend the Committee of Public Safety when the order issued\nfor Paine's death.SICK AND IN PRISON\n\nIt was a strange world into which misfortune had introduced Paine.There\nwas in prison a select and rather philosophical society, mainly persons\nof refinement, more or less released from conventional habit by the\nstrange conditions under which they found themselves.There were\ngentlemen and ladies, no attempt being made to separate them until some\nscandal was reported.The Luxembourg was a special prison for the French\nnobility and the English, who had a good opportunity for cultivating\ndemocratic ideas.The gaoler, Benoit, was good-natured, and cherished\nhis unwilling guests as his children, according to a witness.Paine might even have been happy there but for the ever recurring\ntragedies--the cries of those led forth to death.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.He was now and then in\nstrange juxtapositions.One day Deforgues came to join him, he who had\nconspired with Morris.Instead of receiving for his crime diplomatic\nsecurity in America he found himself beside his victim.Perhaps if\nDeforgues and Paine had known each other's language a confession might\nhave passed There were horrors on horrors.Paine's old friend, Herault\nde Sechelles, was imprisoned for having humanely concealed in his house\na poor officer who was hunted by the police; he parted from Paine for\nthe scaffold.So also he parted from the brilliant Camille Desmoulins,\nand the fine dreamer, Anacharsis Clootz.One day came Danton, who,\ntaking Paine's hand, said: \"That which you did for the happiness and\nliberty of your country, I tried in vain to do for mine.I have been\nless fortunate, but not less innocent.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.They will send me to the\nscaffold; very well, my friends, I shall go gaily.\"Even so did Danton\nmeet his doom.*\n\nAll of the English prisoners became Paine's friends.Among these was\nGeneral O'Hara,--that same general who had fired the American heart at\nYorktown by offering the surrendered sword of Cornwallis to\nRochambeau instead of Washington.O'Hara's captured suite included two\nphysicians--Bond and Graham--who attended Paine during an illness, as he\ngratefully records.What money Paine had when arrested does not appear\nto have been taken from him, and he was able to assist General O'Hara\nwith L200 to return to his country; though by this and similar charities\nhe was left without means when his own unexpected deliverance came.**\n\nThe first part of \"The Age of Reason\" was sent out with final revision\nat the close of January.* \"Memoires sur les prisons,\" t.** Among the anecdotes told of O'Hara in prison, one is related of an\nargument he held with a Frenchman, on the relative degrees of liberty\nin England and France.\"In England,\" he said, \"we are perfectly free to\nwrite and print, George is a good King; but you--why you are not even\nPermitted to write, Robespierre is a tiger!\"In the second edition appeared the following inscription:\n\n\"TO MY FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.--I put the\nfollowing work under your protection.You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always\nstrenuously supported the Right of every man to his opinion, however\ndifferent that opinion might be to mine.He who denies to another this\nright, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he\nprecludes himself the right of changing it.The most formidable weapon\nagainst errors of every kind is Reason.I have never used any other, and\nI trust I never shall.--Your affectionate friend and fellow citizen,\n\n\"Thomas Paine.\"This dedication is dated, \"Luxembourg (Paris), 8th Pluviose, Second year\nof the French Republic, one and indivisible.Paine now addressed himself to the second part of \"The Age of Reason,\"\nconcerning which the following anecdote is told in the manuscript\nmemoranda of Thomas Rickman:\n\n\"Paine, while in the Luxembourg prison and expecting to die hourly, read\nto Mr.Bond (surgeon of Brighton, from whom this anecdote came) parts\nof his _Age of Reason_; and every night, when Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Bond left him, to\nbe separately locked up, and expecting not to see Paine alive in the\nmorning, he [Paine] always expressed his firm belief in the principles\nof that book, and begged Mr.Bond should tell the world such were his\ndying sentiments.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.Paine further said, if he lived he should further\nprosecute the work and print it.Bond added, Paine was the most\nconscientious man he ever knew.\"In after years, when Paine was undergoing persecution for \"infidelity,\"\nhe reminded the zealots that they would have to \"accuse Providence of\ninfidelity,\" for having \"protected him in all his dangers.\"Incidentally\nhe gives reminiscences of his imprisonment.\"I was one of the nine members that composed the first Committee of\nConstitution.Sieyes and myself have\nsurvived--he by bending with the times, and I by not bending.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.The other\nsurvivor [Barrere] joined Robespierre; he was seized and imprisoned in\nhis turn, and sentenced to transportation.He has since apologized to me\nfor having signed the warrant, by saying he felt himself in danger\nand was obliged to do it.Herault Sechelles, an acquaintance of Mr.Jefferson, and a good patriot, was my _suppleant_ as member of the\nCommittee of Constitution.... He was imprisoned in the Luxembourg with\nme, was taken to the tribunal and guillotined, and I, his principal,\nleft.There were two foreigners in the Convention, Anacharsis Clootz\nand myself.We were both put out of the Convention by the same vote,\narrested by the same order, and carried to prison together the same\nnight.He was taken to the guillotine, and I was again left.... Joseph\nLebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who made the\nstreets of Arras run with blood, was my _suppleant_ as member of the\nConvention for the Pas de Calais.When I was put out of the Convention\nhe came and took my place.When I was liberated from prison and voted\nagain into the Convention, he was sent to the same prison and took\nmy place there, and he was sent to the guillotine instead of me.He\nsupplied my place all the way through.\"One hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg\nin one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined next day,\nof which I knew I was to be one; and the manner I escaped that fate is\ncurious, and has all the appearance of accident.The room in which I\nlodged was on the ground floor, and one of a long range of rooms under a\ngallery, and the door of it opened outward and flat against the wall; so\nthat when it was open the inside of the door appeared outward, and the\ncontrary when it was shut.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the apple.I had three comrades, fellow prisoners with\nme, Joseph Vanhuile of Bruges, since president of the municipality of\nthat town, Michael and Robbins Bastini of Louvain.When persons by\nscores and by hundreds were to be taken out of the prison for the\nguillotine it was always done in the night, and those who performed that\noffice had a private mark or signal by which they knew what rooms to go\nto, and what number to take.We, as I have-said, were four, and the door\nof our room was marked, unobserved by us, with that number in chalk; but\nit happened, if happening is the proper word, that the mark was put on\nwhen the door was open and flat against the wall, and thereby came on\nthe inside when we shut it at night; and the destroying angel passed by\nit.\"Paine did not hear of this chalk mark until afterwards.In his letter to\nWashington he says:\n\n\"I had been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the executive\npart of the government of America (Mr.Washington) upon the case, and\nupon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to Robespierre\nthat he might proceed to extremities.A violent fever which had nearly\nterminated my existence was, I believe, the circumstance that preserved\nit.I was not in a condition to be removed, or to know of what was\npassing, or of what had passed, for more than a month.It makes a blank\nin my remembrance of life.The first thing I was informed of was the\nfall of Robespierre.\"The probabilities are that the prison physician Marhaski, whom Paine\nmentions with gratitude, was with him when the chalk mark was made,\nand that there was some connivance in the matter.In the same letter he\nsays:\n\n\"From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robespierre,\nJuly 29, (9th of Thermidor,) the state of things in the prisons was a\ncontinued scene of horror.No man could count upon life for twenty-four\nhours.To such a pitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his\ncommittee arrived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man to\nlive.Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty\nor more were not taken out of the prison, carried before a pretended\ntribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night.One hundred and\nsixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night in the month\nof July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined.A list of two\nhundred more, according to the report in the prison, was preparing a few\ndays before Robespierre fell.In this last list I have good reason to\nbelieve I was included.\"To this Paine adds the memorandum for his accusation found in\nRobespierre's note-book.Of course it was natural, especially with the\nmemorandum, to accept the Robespierre mythology of the time without\ncriticism.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.The massacres of July were not due to Robespierre, who during\nthat time was battling with the Committee of Public Safety, at whose\nhands he fell on the 29th.At the close of June there was an alarm at\npreparations for an insurrection in Luxembourg prison, which caused a\nunion of the Committee of Public Safety and the police, resulting in\nindiscriminate slaughter of prisoners.Barrere, long after, apologized to him for\nhaving signed \"the warrant,\" by saying he felt himself in danger and\nwas obliged to do it Paine accepted the apology, and when Barrere\nhad returned to France, after banishment, Paine introduced him to the\nEnglish author, Lewis Goldsmith.* As Barrere did not sign the warrant\nfor Paine's imprisonment, it must have been a warrant for his death, or\nfor accusation at a moment when it was equivalent to a death sentence.Whatever danger Barrere had to fear, so great as to cause him to\nsacrifice Paine, it was not from Robespierre; else it would not have\ncontinued to keep Paine in prison three months after Robespierre's\ndeath.* \"Memoires de B. Barrere,\" t. i., p.Lewis Goldsmith was\n     the author of \"Crimes of the Cabinets.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.As Robespierre's memorandum was for a \"decree of accusation\" against\nPaine, separately, which might not have gone against him, but possibly\nhave dragged to light the conspiracy against him, there would seem to be\nno ground for connecting that \"demand\" with the warrant signed by a\nCommittee he did not attend.Paine had good cause for writing as he did in praise of \"Forgetfulness.\"During the period in which he was unconscious with fever the horrors of\nthe prison reached their apogee.On June 19th the kindly gaoler, Benoit,\nwas removed and tried; he was acquitted but not restored.His place was\ngiven to a cruel fellow named Gayard, who instituted a reign of terror\nin the prison.There are many evidences that the good Benoit, so warmly remembered\nby Paine, evaded the rigid police regulations as to communications of\nprisoners with their friends outside, no doubt with precaution against\nthose of a political character.It is pleasant to record an instance\nof this which was the means of bringing beautiful rays of light into\nPaine's cell.Shortly before his arrest an English lady had called on\nhim, at his house in the Faubourg St.Denis, to ask his intervention in\nbehalf of an Englishman of rank who had been arrested.Paine had now,\nhowever, fallen from power, and could not render the requested service.This lady was the last visitor who preceded the officers who\narrested him.But while he was in prison there was brought to him a\ncommunication, in a lady's handwriting, signed \"A little corner of the\nWorld.\"So far as can be gathered, this letter was of a poetical\ncharacter, perhaps tinged with romance.It was followed by others, all\nevidently meant to beguile the weary and fearful hours of a prisoner\nwhom she had little expectation of ever meeting again.Paine, by the aid\nof Benoit, managed to answer his \"contemplative correspondent,\" as he\ncalled her, signing, \"The Castle in the Air.\"These letters have never\nseen the light, but the sweetness of this sympathy did, for many an\nhour, bring into Paine's _oubliette_ the oblivion of grief described in\nthe letter on \"Forgetfulness,\" sent to the lady after his liberation.\"Memory, like a beauty that is always present to hear herself\nflattered, is flattered by every one.But the absent and silent goddess,\nForgetfulness, has no votaries, and is never thought of: yet we owe her\nmuch.She is the goddess of ease, though not of pleasure.When the mind\nis like a room hung with black, and every corner of it crowded with the\nmost horrid images imagination can create, this kind, speechless maid,\nForgetfulness, is following us night and day with her opium wand, and\ngently touching first one and then another, benumbs them into rest, and\nthen glides away with the silence of a departing shadow.\"Paine was not forgotten by his old friends in France.So soon as the\nexcitement attending Robespierre's execution had calmed a little,\nLan-thenas (August 7th) sent Merlin de Thionville a copy of the \"Age of\nReason,\" which he had translated, and made his appeal.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.\"I think it would be in the well-considered interest of the Republic,\nsince the fall of the tyrants we have overthrown, to re-examine the\nmotives of Thomas Paine's imprisonment.That re-examination is suggested\nby too many and sensible grounds to be related in detail.Every friend\nof liberty familiar with the history of our Revolution, and feeling the\nnecessity of repelling the slanders with which despots are loading it in\nthe eyes of nations, misleading them against us, will understand these\ngrounds.Should the Committee of Public Safety, having before it no\nfounded charge or suspicion against Thomas Paine, retain any scruples,\nand think that from my occasional conversation with that foreigner, whom\nthe people's suffrage called to the national representation, and some\nacquaintance with his language, I might perhaps throw light upon their\ndoubt, I would readily communicate to them all that I know about him.I\nrequest Merlin de Thionville to submit these considerations to the\nCommittee.\"Merlin was now a leading member of the Committee.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.On the following day\nPaine sent (in French) the following letters:\n\n\"Citizens, Representatives, and Members of the Committee of Public\nSafety: I address you a copy of a letter which I have to-day written to\nthe Convention.The singular situation in which I find myself determines\nme to address myself to the whole Convention, of which you are a part\n\n\"Thomas Paine.Maison d'Arret du Luxembourg, Le 19 Thermidor, l'an 2 de\nla Republique, une et indivisible.\"\"Citizen Representatives: If I should not express myself with the energy\nI used formerly to do, you will attribute it to the very dangerous\nillness I have suffered in the prison of the Luxembourg.For several\ndays I was insensible of my own existence; and though I am much\nrecovered, it is with exceeding great difficulty that I find power to\nwrite you this letter.\"But before I proceed further, I request the Convention to observe: that\nthis is the first line that has come from me, either to the Convention,\nor to any of the Committees, since my imprisonment,--which is\napproaching to Eight months.--Ah, my friends, eight months' loss of\nLiberty seems almost a life-time to a man who has been, as I have been,\nthe unceasing defender of Liberty for twenty years.\"I have now to inform the Convention of the reason of my not having\nwritten before.It is a year ago that I had strong reason to believe\nthat Robespierre was my inveterate enemy, as he was the enemy of every\nman of virtue and humanity.The address that was sent to the Convention\nsome time about last August from Arras, the native town of Robespierre,\nI have always been informed was the work of that hypocrite and the\npartizans he had in the place.The intention of that address was to\nprepare the way for destroying me, by making the People declare (though\nwithout assigning any reason) that I had lost their confidence; the\nAddress, however, failed of success, as it was immediately opposed by\na counter-address from St.But\nthe strange power that Robespierre, by the most consummate hypocrisy\nand the most hardened cruelties, had obtained rendered any attempt on\nmy part to obtain justice not only useless but even dangerous; for it\nis the nature of Tyranny always to strike a deeper blow when any attempt\nhas been made to repel a former one.This being my situation I submitted\nwith patience to the hardness of my fate and waited the event of\nbrighter days.I hope they are now arrived to the nation and to me.\"Citizens, when I left the United States in the year 1787, I promised to\nall my friends that I would return to them the next year; but the hope\nof seeing a Revolution happily established in France, that might serve\nas a model to the rest of Europe, and the earnest and disinterested\ndesire of rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced me\nto defer my return to that country, and to the society of my friends,\nfor more than seven years.This long sacrifice of private tranquillity,\nespecially after having gone through the fatigues and dangers of the\nAmerican Revolution which continued almost eight years, deserved a\nbetter fate than the long imprisonment I have silently suffered.But it\nis not the nation but a faction that has done me this injustice, and it\nis to the national representation that I appeal against that injustice.Parties and Factions, various and numerous as they have been, I have\nalways avoided.My heart was devoted to all France, and the object to\nwhich I applied myself was the Constitution.The Plan which I proposed\nto the Committee, of which I was a member, is now in the hands of\nBarrere, and it will speak for itself.\"It is perhaps proper that I inform you of the cause assigned in the\norder for my imprisonment It is that I am 'a Foreigner'; whereas, the\n_Foreigner_ thus imprisoned was invited into France by a decree of the\nlate national Assembly, and that in the hour of her greatest danger,\nwhen invaded by Austrians and Prussians.He was, moreover, a citizen of\nthe United States of America, an ally of France, and not a subject of\nany country in Europe, and consequently not within the intentions of\nany of the decrees concerning Foreigners.But any excuse can be made to\nserve the purpose of malignity when it is in power.\"I will not intrude on your time by offering any apology for the broken\nand imperfect manner in which I have expressed myself.I request you to\naccept it with the sincerity with which it comes from my heart; and I\nconclude with wishing Fraternity and prosperity to France, and union and\nhappiness to her representatives.\"Citizens, I have now stated to you my situation, and I can have no\ndoubt but your justice will restore me to the Liberty of which I have\nbeen deprived.\"Luxembourg, Thermidor 19th, 2d year of the French Republic, one and\nindivisible.\"No doubt this touching letter would have been effectual had it reached\nthe Convention.But the Committee of Public Safety took care that no\nwhisper even of its existence should be heard.Paine's participation in\ntheir fostered dogma, that _Robespierre le veut_ explained all crimes,\nprobably cost him three more months in prison.The lamb had confided its\nappeal to the wolf.Barrere, Bil-laud-Varennes, and Collot d'Herbois,\nby skilful use of the dead scapegoat, maintained their places on the\nCommittee until September 1st, and after that influenced its counsels.At the same time Morris, as we shall see, was keeping Monroe out of his\nplace.There might have been a serious reckoning for these men had Paine\nbeen set free, or his case inquired into by the Convention.And Thuriot\nwas now on the Committee of Public Safety; he was eager to lay his own\ncrimes on Robespierre, and to conceal those of the Committee.Paine's\nold friend, Achille Audibert, unsuspicious as himself of the real\nfacts, sent an appeal (August 20th) to \"Citizen Thuriot, member of the\nCommittee of Public Safety.\"\"Representative:--A friend of mankind is groaning in chains,--Thomas\nPaine, who was not so politic as to remain silent in regard to a man\nunlike himself, but dared to say that Robespierre was a monster to be\nerased from the list of men.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple.From that moment he became a criminal;\nthe despot marked him as his victim, put him into prison, and doubtless\nprepared the way to the scaffold for him, as for others who knew him and\nwere courageous enough to speak out.*\n\n     * It most be remembered that at this time it seemed the\n     strongest recommendation of any one to public favor to\n     describe him as a victim of Robespierre;

Bouchot, a weak creature who, as Morris said, would\nnot wipe his nose without permission of the Committee of Public Safety.When Monroe opened Paine's case he was asked whether he had brought\ninstructions.Of course he had none, for the administration had no\nsuspicion that Morris had not, as he said, attended to the case.When Paine recovered from his fever he heard that Monroe had superseded\nMorris.\"As soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be read,\nI found a way to convey one to him [Monroe] by means of the man who\nlighted the lamps in the prison, and whose unabated friendship to me,\nfrom whom he never received any service, and with difficulty accepted\nany recompense, puts the character of Mr.In a few\ndays I received a message from Mr.Monroe, conveyed in a note from an\nintermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and expressing\na desire that I should rest the case in his hands.After a fortnight\nor more had passed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a friend\n[Whiteside], a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him to inform me what\nwas the true situation of things with respect to me.I was sure\nthat something was the matter; I began to have hard thoughts of Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.In about ten days I\nreceived an answer to my letter, in which the writer says: 'Mr.Monroe\ntold me he had no order (meaning from the president, Mr.Washington)\nrespecting you, but that he (Mr.Monroe) will do everything in his\npower to liberate you, but, from what I learn from the Americans\nlately arrived in Paris, you are not considered, either by the American\ngovernment or by individuals, as an American citizen.'\"As the American government did regard Paine as an American citizen,\nand approved Monroe's demanding him as such, there is no difficulty in\nrecognizing the source from which these statements were diffused among\nPaine's newly arriving countrymen.On the receipt of Whiteside's note, Paine wrote a Memorial to Monroe,\nof which important parts--amounting to eight printed pages--are omitted\nfrom American and English editions of his works.In quoting this\nMemorial, I select mainly the omitted portions.*\n\n     * The whole is published in French: \"Memoire de Thomas\n     Payne, autographe et signe de sa main: addresse a M. Monroe,\n     ministre des Etats-unis en France, pour reclamer sa mise en\n     liberte comme Citoyen Americain, zo Septembre, 1794.Paine says that before leaving London for the Convention, he consulted\nMinister Pinckney, who agreed with him that \"it was for the interest of\nAmerica that the system of European governments should be changed and\nplaced on the same principle with her own\"; and adds: \"I have wished to\nsee America the mother church of government, and I have done my utmost\nto exalt her character and her condition.\"He points out that he had not\naccepted any title or office under a foreign government, within the\nmeaning of the United States Constitution, because there was no\ngovernment in France, the Convention being assembled to frame one; that\nhe was a citizen of France only in the honorary sense in which others in\nEurope and America were declared such; that no oath of allegiance was\nrequired or given.The following paragraphs are from various parts of\nthe Memorial.\"They who propagate the report of my not being considered as a citizen\nof America by government, do it to the prolongation of my imprisonment,\nand without authority; for Congress, as a government, has neither\ndecided upon it, nor yet taken the matter into consideration; and I\nrequest you to caution such persons against spreading such reports....\n\n\"I know not what opinions have been circulated in America.It may have\nbeen supposed there, that I had voluntarily and intentionally abandoned\nAmerica, and that my citizenship had ceased by my own choice.I can\neasily conceive that there are those in that Country who would take such\na proceeding on my part somewhat in disgust.The idea of forsaking\nold friendships for new acquaintances is not agreeable.I am a little\nwarranted in making this supposition by a letter I received some time\nago from the wife of one of the Georgia delegates, in which she says,\n'your friends on this side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea\nof your abandoning America.'I have never abandoned America in thought,\nword, or deed, and I feel it incumbent upon me to give this assurance\nto the friends I have in that country, and with whom I have always\nintended, and am determined, if the possibility exists, to close the\nscene of my life.It is there that I have made myself a home.It is\nthere that I have given the services of my best days.America never\nsaw me flinch from her cause in the most gloomy and perilous of her\nsituations: and I know there are those in that Country who will not\nflinch from me.If I have Enemies (and every man has some) I leave them\nto the enjoyment of their ingratitude....\n\n\"It is somewhat extraordinary, that the Idea of my not being a Citizen\nof America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned\nin France because, or on the pretence that, I am a foreigner.The case\ninvolves a strange contradiction of Ideas.None of the Americans who\ncame to France whilst I was in liberty, had conceived any such idea or\ncirculated any such opinion; and why it should arise now is a matter\nyet to be explained.However discordant the late American Minister,\nGouverneur Morris, and the late French Committee of Public Safety were,\nit suited the purpose of both that I should be continued in arrestation.The former wished to prevent my return to America, that I should not\nexpose his misconduct; and the latter, lest I should publish to the\nworld the history of its wickedness.Whilst that Minister and that\nCommittee continued, I had no expectation of liberty.I speak here of\nthe Committee of which Robespierre was a member....\n\n\"I here close my Memorial and proceed to offer to you a proposal, that\nappears to me suited to all the circumstances of the case; which is,\nthat you reclaim me conditionally, until the opinion of Congress can\nbe obtained upon the subject of my Citizenship of America, and that I\nremain in liberty under your protection during that time.I found this\nproposal upon the following grounds:\n\n\"First, you say you have no orders respecting me; consequently you\nhave no orders _not_ to reclaim me; and in this case you are left\ndiscretionary judge whether to reclaim or not.My proposal therefore\nunites a consideration of your situation with my own.\"Secondly, I am put in arrestation because I am a foreigner.It is\ntherefore necessary to determine to what Country I belong.The right of\ndetermining this question cannot appertain exclusively to the committee\nof public safety or general surety; because I appear to the Minister of\nthe United States, and shew that my citizenship of that Country is good\nand valid, referring at the same time, through the agency of the\nMinister, my claim of Right to the opinion of Congress,--it being a\nmatter between two governments.\"Thirdly, France does not claim me for a citizen; neither do I set up\nany claim of citizenship in France.The question is simply, whether I am\nor am not a citizen of America.I am imprisoned here on the decree for\nimprisoning Foreigners, because, say they, I was born in England.I\nsay in answer, that, though born in England, I am not a subject of the\nEnglish Government any more than any other American is who was born, as\nthey all were, under the same government, or that the citizens of France\nare subjects of the French monarchy, under which they were born.I have\ntwice taken the oath of abjuration to the British king and government,\nand of Allegiance to America.Once as a citizen of the State of\nPennsylvania in 1776; and again before Congress, administered to me by\nthe President, Mr.Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary in the office\nof foreign affairs in 1777....\n\n\"Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to\nbelieve that my imprisonment proves to the world that I had no share in\nthe murderous system that then reigned.That I was an enemy to it, both\nmorally and politically, is known to all who had any knowledge of\nme; and could I have written French as well as I can English, I would\npublicly have exposed its wickedness, and shown the ruin with which it\nwas pregnant.They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether\nin America or England, will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem\nwhen they reflect, that imprisonment with preservation of character, is\npreferable to liberty with disgrace.\"In a postscript Paine adds that \"as Gouverneur Morris could not inform\nCongress of the cause of my arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it\nis to be supposed that Congress was not enough acquainted with the case\nto give any directions respecting me when you left.\"Which to the reader\nof the preceding pages will appear sufficiently naive.To this Monroe responded (September 18th) with a letter of warm\nsympathy, worthy of the high-minded gentleman that he was.After\nascribing the notion that Paine was not an American to mental confusion,\nand affirming his determination to maintain his rights as a citizen of\nthe United States, Monroe says:\n\n\"It is unnecessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I\nspeak of the great mass of the people, are interested in your welfare.They have not forgotten the history of their own revolution, and the\ndifficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its\nseveral stages without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the\nmerits of those who served them in that great and arduous conflict.The\ncrime of ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain,\nour national character.You are considered by them, as not only having\nrendered important services in our own revolution, but as being on a\nmore extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished\nand able advocate in favor of public liberty.To the welfare of Thomas\nPaine the Americans are not and cannot be indifferent.Of the sense\nwhich the President has always entertained of your merits, and of his\nfriendly disposition towards you, you are too well assured to require\nany declaration of it from me.That I forward his wishes in seeking your\nsafety is what I well know; and this will form an additional obligation\non me to perform what I should otherwise consider as a duty.\"You are, in my opinion, menaced by no kind of danger.To liberate you,\nwill be an object of my endeavors, and as soon as possible.But you\nmust, until that event shall be accomplished, face your situation with\npatience and fortitude; you will likewise have the justice to recollect,\nthat I am placed here upon a difficult theatre, many important objects\nto attend to, and with few to consult.It becomes me in pursuit of\nthose, to regulate my conduct in respect to each, as to the manner and\nthe time, as will, in my judgment, be best calculated to accomplish the\nwhole.\"With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend,\n\n\"James Monroe.\"Monroe was indeed \"placed upon a difficult theatre.\"Morris was showing\na fresh letter from the President expressing unabated confidence in him,\napologizing for his recall; he still had friends in the Committee of\nPublic Safety, to which Monroe had appealed in vain.The continued dread\nthe conspirators had of Paine's liberation appears in the fact that\nMonroe's letter, written September 18th, did not reach Paine until\nOctober 18th, when Morris had reached the boundary line of Switzerland,\nwhich he entered on the 19th.He had left Paris (Sainport) October 14th,\nwhen Barrere, Billaud-Varennes, and Collot d'Herbois, no longer on\nthe Committee, were under accusation, and their papers under\ninvestigation,--a search that resulted in their exile.Morris got across\nthe line on an irregular passport.While Monroe's reassuring letter to Paine was taking a month to\npenetrate his prison walls, he vainly grappled with the subtle\nobstacles.All manner of delays impeded the correspondence, the\nprincipal one being that he could present no instructions from the\nPresident concerning Paine.Of course he was fighting in the dark,\nhaving no suspicion that the imprisonment was due to his predecessor.At length, however, he received from Secretary Randolph a letter (dated\nJuly 30th), from which, though Paine was not among its specifications,\nhe could select a sentence as basis of action: \"We have heard with\nregret that several of our citizens have been thrown into prison in\nFrance, from a suspicion of criminal attempts against the government.If\nthey are guilty we are extremely sorry for it; if innocent we must\nprotect them.\"What Paine had said in his Memorial of collusion between\nMorris and the Committee of Public Safety probably determined Monroe to\napply no more in that quarter; so he wrote (November 2d) to the\nCommittee of General Surety.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.After stating the general principles and\nlimitations of ministerial protection to an imprisoned countryman, he\nadds:\n\n\"The citizens of the United States cannot look back upon the time of\ntheir own revolution without recollecting among the names of their most\ndistinguished patriots that of Thomas Paine; the services he rendered to\nhis country in its struggle for freedom have implanted in the hearts of\nhis countrymen a sense of gratitude never to be effaced as long as they\nshall deserve the title of a just and generous people.\"The above-named citizen is at this moment languishing in prison,\naffected with a disease growing more intense from his confinement.I\nbeg, therefore, to call your attention to his condition and to request\nyou to hasten the moment when the law shall decide his fate, in case of\nany accusation against him, and if none, to restore him to liberty.At this the first positive assertion of Paine's American citizenship the\nprison door flew open.He had been kept there solely \"pour les interets\nde l'Amerique,\" as embodied in Morris, and two days after Monroe\nundertook, without instructions, to affirm the real interests of America\nin Paine he was liberated.Third year of the French Republic.--The Committee of\nGeneral Surety orders that the Citizen Thomas Paine be set at liberty,\nand the seals taken from his papers, on sight of these presents.\"Members of the Committee (signed): Clauzel, Lesage, Senault, Bentabole,\nReverchon, Goupilleau de Fontenai, Rewbell.\"Delivered to Clauzel, as Commissioner.\"*\n\nThere are several interesting points about this little decree.It\nis signed by Bentabole, who had moved Paine's expulsion from the\nConvention.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.It orders that the seals be removed from Paine's papers,\nwhereas none had been placed on them, the officers reporting them\ninnocent.This same authority, which had ordered Paine's arrest, now,\nin ordering his liberation, shows that the imprisonment had never been\na subject of French inquiry.It had ordered the seals but did not know\nwhether they were on the papers or not.It was no concern of France,\nbut only of the American Minister.It is thus further evident that when\nMonroe invited a trial of Paine there was not the least trace of any\ncharge against him.And there was precisely the same absence of any\naccusation against Paine in the new Committee of Public Safety, to which\nMonroe's letter was communicated the same day.Writing to Secretary Randolph (November 7th) Monroe says:\n\n\"He was actually a citizen of the United States, and of the United\nStates only; for the Revolution which parted us from Great Britain broke\nthe allegiance which was before due to the Crown, of all who took our\nside.He was, of course, not a British subject; nor was he strictly a\ncitizen of France, for he came by invitation for the temporary purpose\nof assisting in the formation of their government only, and meant to\nwithdraw to America when that should be completed.And what confirms\nthis is the act of the Convention itself arresting him, by which he is\ndeclared a foreigner.\"I told him I had hoped getting him enlarged without it; but, if I did\ninterfere, it could only be by requesting that he be tried, in case\nthere was any charge against him, and liberated in case there was\nnot.His correspondence with me is lengthy and\ninteresting, and I may probably be able hereafter to send you a copy\nof it.After some time had elapsed, without producing any change in his\nfavor, I finally resolved to address the Committee of General Surety in\nhis behalf, resting my application on the above principle.My letter was\ndelivered by my Secretary in the Committee to the president, who assured\nhim he would communicate its contents immediately to the Committee of\nPublic Safety, and give me an answer as soon as possible.The conference\ntook place accordingly between the two Committees, and, as I presume,\non that night, or on the succeeding day; for on the morning of the day\nafter, which was yesterday, I was presented by the Secretary of the\nCommittee of General Surety with an order for his enlargement.I\nforwarded it immediately to the Luxembourg, and had it carried into\neffect; and have the pleasure now to add that he is not only released to\nthe enjoyment of liberty, but is in good spirits.\"In reply, the Secretary of State (Randolph) in a letter to Monroe of\nMarch 8, 1795, says: \"Your observations on our commercial relations\nto France, and your conduct as to Mr.Gardoqui's letter, prove your\njudgment and assiduity.Paine, and the\nlady of our friend [Lafayette] less approved.\"Thus, after an imprisonment of ten months and nine days, Thomas Paine\nwas liberated from the prison into which he had been cast by a Minister\nof the United States.A RESTORATION\n\nAs in 1792 Paine had left England with the authorities at his heels,\nso in 1794 escaped Morris from France.The ex-Minister went off to\nplay courtier to George III.the despotic\nproclamation with which monarchy was to be restored in France*; Paine\nsat in the house of a real American Minister, writing proclamations of\nrepublicanism to invade the empires.While the American Minister in Paris and his wife were nursing their\npredecessor's victim back into life, a thrill of joy was passing\nthrough European courts, on a rumor that the dreaded author had\nbeen guillotined.Paine had the satisfaction of reading, at Monroe's\nfireside, his own last words on the scaffold,** and along with it an\ninvitation of the 27th of December 1792.* Morris' royal proclamations are printed in full in his\n     biography by Jared Sparks.** \"The last dying words of Thomas Paine.Executed at the\n     Guillotine in France on the 1st of September, 1794.\"The\n     dying speech begins: \"Ye numerous spectators gathered\n     around, pray give ear to my last words; I am determined to\n     speak the Truth in these my last moments, altho' I have\n     written and spoke nothing but lies all my life.\"There is\n     nothing in the witless leaflet worth quoting.When Paine was\n     burnt in effigy, in 1792, it appears to have been with\n     accompaniments of the same kind.Before me is a small\n     placard, which reads thus: \"The Dying Speech and Confession\n     of the Arch-Traitor Thomas Paine.Who was executed at Oakham\n     on Thursday.\"\"This morning the Officers usually attending on such\n     occasions went in procession on Horseback to the County\n     Gaol, and demanded the Body of the Arch-Traitor, and from\n     thence proceeded with the Criminal drawn in a Cart by an Ass\n     to the usual place of execution with his Pamphlet called the\n     'Rights of Man' in his right hand.\"On December 7, 1794, Thibaudeau had spoken to that assembly in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\"It yet remains for the Convention to perform an act of justice.I\nreclaim one of the most zealous defenders of liberty'--Thomas Paine.My reclamation is for a man who has honored his\nage by his energy in defence of the rights of humanity, and who is\nso gloriously distinguished by his part in the American revolution.A\nnaturalized Frenchman* by a decree of the legislative assembly, he was\nnominated by the people.It was only by an intrigue that he was driven\nfrom the Convention, the pretext being a decree excluding foreigners\nfrom representing the French people.There were only two foreigners in\nthe Convention; one [Anacharsis Clootz] is dead, and I speak not of him,\nbut of Thomas Paine, who powerfully contributed to establish liberty in\na country allied with the French Republic.I demand that he be recalled\nto the bosom of the Convention.\"(_Applause._)\n\n\"The _Moniteur_, from which I translate, reports the unanimous adoption\nof Thibaudeau's motion.The Committee of Public\nInstruction, empowered to award pensions for literary services, reported\n(January 3, 1795) as the first name on their list, Thomas Paine.Chenier, in reading the report, claimed the honor of having originally\nsuggested Paines name as an honorary citizen of France, and denounced,\namid applause, the decree against foreigners under which the great\nauthor had suffered.In the next sentence but one\n     he rightly describes Paine as a foreigner.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.The allusion to\n     \"an intrigue\" is significant.You have revoked that inhospitable decree, and we again see Thomas\nPaine, the man of genius without fortune, our colleague, dear to all\nfriends of humanity,--a cosmopolitan, persecuted equally by Pitt and by\nRobespierre.Notable epoch in the life of this philosopher, who opposed\nthe arms of Common Sense to the sword of Tyranny, the Rights of Man to\nthe machiavelism of English politicians; and who, by two immortal works,\nhas deserved well of the human race, and consecrated liberty in the two\nworlds.\"Poor as he was, Paine declined this literary pension.He accepted\nthe honors paid him by the Convention, no doubt with a sorrow at the\ncontrasted silence of those who ruled in America.Monroe, however,\nencouraged him to believe that he was still beloved there, and, as he\ngot stronger, a great homesickness came upon him.The kindly host\nmade an effort to satisfy him.On January 4th he (Monroe) wrote to the\nCommittee of Public Safety:\n\n\"Citizens: The Decree just passed, bearing on the execution of Articles\n23 and 24 of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between the two\nRepublics, is of such great importance to my country, that I think it\nexpedient to send it there officially, by some particularly confidential\nhand; and no one seems to be better fitted for this errand than Thomas\nPaine, Having resided a long time in France, and having a perfect\nknowledge of the many vicissitudes which the Republic has passed, he\nwill be able to explain and compare the happy lot she now enjoys.As he\nhas passed the same himself, remaining faithful to his principles, his\nreports will be the more trustworthy, and consequently produce a better\neffect.But as Citizen Paine is a member of the Convention, I thought it\nbetter to submit this subject to your consideration.If this affair\ncan be arranged, the Citizen will leave for America immediately, via\nBordeaux, on an American vessel which will be prepared for him.As he\nhas reason to fear the persecution of the English government, should he\nbe taken prisoner, he desires that his departure may be kept a secret.The Convention alone could give a passport to one of its members, and\nas an application to it would make Paine's mission known, the Committee\nreturned next day a negative answer.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"Citizen: We see with satisfaction and without surprise, that you attach\nsome interest to sending officially to the United States the Decree\nwhich the National Convention has just made, in which are recalled and\nconfirmed the reports of Friendship and Commerce existing between the\ntwo Republics.\"As to the design you express of confiding this errand to Citizen Thomas\nPaine, we must observe to you that the position he holds will not permit\nhim to accept it.\"*\n\nLiberty's great defender gets least of it!The large seal of the\nCommittee--mottoed \"Activity, Purity, Attention\"--looks like a wheel of\nfortune; but one year before it had borne from the Convention to prison\nthe man it now cannot do without.France now especially needs the\ncounsel of shrewd and friendly American heads.There are indications\nthat Jay in London is carrying the United States into Pitt's combination\nagainst the Republic, just as it is breaking up on the Continent.Monroe's magnanimity towards Paine found its reward.He brought to his\nhouse, and back into life, just the one man in France competent to\ngive him the assistance he needed.Comprehending the history of the\nRevolution, knowing the record of every actor in it, Paine was able to\nrevise Monroe's impressions, and enable him to check calumnies\ncirculated in America.The despatches of Monroe are of high historic\nvalue, largely through knowledge derived from Paine.Monroe\n     dates his letter, \"19th year of the American Republic.\"In Monroe's instructions emphasis was laid on\nthe importance to the United States of the free navigation of the\nMississippi and its ultimate control.* Paine's former enthusiasm in this\nmatter had possibly been utilized by Gouverneur Morris to connect him,\nas we have seen, with Genet's proceedings.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.The Kentuckians consulted\nPaine at a time when expulsion of the Spaniard was a patriotic American\nscheme.This is shown in a letter written by the Secretary of State\n(Randolph) to the President, February 27, 1794.Brown [Senator of Kentucky] has shown me a letter from the famous\nDr.O'Fallon to Captain Herron, dated Oct 18, 1793.It was intercepted,\nand he has permitted me to take the following extract:--'This plan\n(an attack on Louisiana) was digested between Gen.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.I framed the whole of the correspondence in the General's\nname, and corroborated it by a private letter of my own to Mr.Thomas\nPaine, of the National Assembly, with whom during the late war I was\nvery intimate.His reply reached me but a few days since, enclosed in\nthe General's despatches from the Ambassador.\"**\n\n     * \"The conduct of Spain towards us is unaccountable and\n     injurious.Pinckney is by this time gone over to Madrid\n     as our envoy extraordinary to bring matters to a conclusion\n     some way or other.But you will seize any favorable moment\n     to execute what has been entrusted to you respecting the\n     Mississippi.\"--Randolph to Monroe, February 15, 1795.** Two important historical works have recently appeared\n     relating to the famous Senator Brown.The first is a\n     publication of the Filson Club: \"The Political Beginnings of\n     Kentucky,\" by John Mason Brown.The second is: \"The Spanish\n     Conspiracy,\" by Thomas Marshall Green (Cincinnati, Robert\n     Clarke & Co., 1891).The intercepted letter quoted above has\n     some bearing on the controversy between these authors.Apparently, Senator Brown, like many other good patriots,\n     favored independent action in Kentucky when that seemed for\n     the welfare of the United States, but, when the situation\n     had changed, Brown is found co-operating with Washington and\n     Randolph.That such letters (freely written as they were at the beginning of 1793)\nwere now intercepted indicates the seriousness of the situation time had\nbrought on.The administration had soothed the Kentuckians by pledges\nof pressing the matter by negotiations.Hence Monroe's instructions, in\ncarrying out which Paine was able to lend a hand.{1795}\n\nIn the State Archives at Paris (Etats Unis, vol.there are two\npapers marked \"Thomas Payne.\"The first urges the French Ministry to\nseize the occasion of a treaty with Spain to do a service to the United\nStates: let the free navigation of the Mississippi be made by France a\ncondition of peace.The second paper (endorsed \"3 Ventose, February 21,\n1795\") proposes that, in addition to the condition made to Spain, an\neffort should be made to include American interests in the negotiation\nwith England, if not too late.The negotiation with England was\nthen finished, but the terms unpublished.Paine recommended that the\nConvention should pass a resolution that freedom of the Mississippi\nshould be a condition of peace with Spain, which would necessarily\naccept it; and that, in case the arrangement with England should\nprove unsatisfactory, any renewed negotiations should support the just\nreclamations of their American ally for the surrender of the frontier\nposts and for depredations on their trade.Paine points out that such a\ndeclaration could not prolong the war a day, nor cost France an obole;\nwhereas it might have a decisive effect in the United States, especially\nif Jay's treaty with England should be reprehensible, and should be\napproved in America.That generosity \"would certainly raise the reputation of the French\nRepublic to the most eminent degree of splendour, and lower in\nproportion that of her enemies.\"It would undo the bad effects of the\ndepredations of French privateers on American vessels, which rejoiced\nthe British party in the United States and discouraged the friends of\nliberty and humanity there.It would acquire for France the merit\nwhich is her due, supply her American friends with strength against the\nintrigues of England, and cement the alliance of the Republics.This able paper might have been acted on, but for the anger in France at\nthe Jay treaty.While writing in Monroe's house, the invalid, with an abscess in his\nside and a more painful sore in his heart--for he could not forget that\nWashington had forgotten him,--receives tidings of new events through\ncries", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "In the month of his release they had been resonant\nwith yells as the Jacobins were driven away and their rooms turned to\na Normal School.Then came shouts, when, after trial, the murderous\ncommitteemen were led to execution or exile.In the early weeks of 1795\nthe dread sounds of retribution subside, and there is a cry from the\nstreet that comes nearer to Paine's heart--\"Bread and the Constitution\nof Ninety-three!\"He knows that it is his Constitution for which\nthey are really calling, for they cannot understand the Robespierrian\nadulteration of it given out, as one said, as an opiate to keep the\ncountry asleep.These are the\npeople in whom Paine has ever believed,--the honest hearts that summoned\nhim, as author of \"The Rights of Man,\" to help form their Constitution.They, he knows, had to be deceived when cruel deeds were done, and\nheard of such deeds with as much horror as distant peoples.Over that\nConstitution for which they were clamoring he and his lost friend\nCondorcet had spent many a day of honest toil.Of the original Committee\nof Nine appointed for the work, six had perished by the revolution,\none was banished, and two remained--Sieyes and Paine.That original\nCommittee had gradually left the task to Paine and Condorcet,--Sieyes,\nbecause he had no real sympathy with republicanism, though he honored\nPaine.* When afterwards asked how he had survived the Terror, Sieyes\nanswered, \"I lived.\"He lived by bending, and now leads a Committee of\nEleven on the Constitution, while Paine, who did not bend, is\ndisabled.The people will vainly try for the\n\"Constitution of Ninety-three.\"They shall have no Constitution but\nof Sieyes' making, and in it will be some element of monarchy.Sieyes\npresently seemed to retire from the Committee, but old republicans did\nnot doubt that he was all the more swaying it.Thomas Paine is one of those men who have contributed\n     the most to establish the liberty of America.His ardent\n     love of humanity, and his hatred of every sort of tyranny,\n     have induced him to take up in England the defence of the\n     French revolution, against the amphigorical declamation of\n     Mr.His work has been translated into our language,\n     and is universally known.What French patriot is there who\n     has not already, from the bottom of his heart, thanked this\n     foreigner for having strengthened our cause by all the\n     powers of his reason and reputation?It is with pleasure\n     that I observe an opportunity of offering him the tribute of\n     my gratitude and my esteem for the truly philosophical\n     application of talents so distinguished as his own.\"--Sieyes\n     in the Moniteur, July 6, 1791.So once more Paine seizes his pen; his hand is feeble, but His intellect\nhas lost no fibre of force, nor his heart its old faith.His trust in\nman has passed through the ordeal of seeing his friends--friends of\nman--murdered by the people's Convention, himself saved by accident; it\nhas survived the apparent relapse of Washington into the arms of\nGeorge the Third.The ingratitude of his faithfully-served America\nis represented by an abscess in his side, which may strike into his\nheart--in a sense has done so--but will never reach his faith in\nliberty, equality, and humanity.Early in July the Convention is reading Paine's \"Dissertation on First\nPrinciples of Government\" His old arguments against hereditary right,\nor investing even an elective individual with extraordinary power, are\nrepeated with illustrations from the passing Revolution.\"Had a Constitution been established two years ago, as ought to have\nbeen done, the violences that have since desolated France and injured\nthe character of the revolution, would, in my opinion, have been\nprevented.The nation would have had a bond of union, and every\nindividual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow.But,\ninstead of this, a revolutionary government, a thing without either\nprinciple or authority, was substituted in its place; virtue or crime\ndepended upon accident; and that which was patriotism one day, became\ntreason the next.All these things have followed from the want of a\nConstitution; for it is the nature and intention or a Constitution to\nprevent governing by party, by establishing a common principle that\nshall limit and control the power and impulse of party, and that says\nto all parties, _Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther_.But in the\nabsence of a Constitution men look entirely to party; and instead of\nprinciple governing party, party governs principle.\"An avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty.It leads men to\nstretch, to misinterpret and to misapply even the best of laws.He\nthat would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from\noppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent\nthat will reach himself.\"Few of Paine's pamphlets better deserve study than this.In writing it,\nhe tells us, he utilized the fragment of a work begun at some time\nnot stated, which he meant to dedicate to the people of Holland,\nthen contemplating a revolution.It is a condensed statement of the\nprinciples underlying the Constitution written by himself and Condorcet,\nnow included among Condorcet's works.They who imagine that Paine's\npolitical system was that of the democratic demagogues may undeceive\nthemselves by pondering this pamphlet.It has been pointed out, on a\nprevious page of this work, that Paine held the representative to be\nnot the voter's mouthpiece, but his delegated sovereignty.The\nrepresentatives of a people are therefore its supreme power.The\nexecutive, the ministers, are merely as chiefs of the national police\nengaged in enforcing the laws.They are mere employes, without any\nauthority at all, except of superintendence.\"The executive department\nis official, and is subordinate to the legislative as the body is to\nthe mind.\"The chief of these official departments is the judicial.In\nappointing officials the most important rule is, \"never to invest any\nindividual with extraordinary power; for besides being tempted to\nmisuse it, it will excite contention and commotion in the nation for\nthe office.\"All of this is in logical conformity with the same author's\n\"Rights of Man,\" which James Madison declared to be an exposition of the\nprinciples on which the United States government is based.It would be\nentertaining to observe the countenance of a President should our House\nof Representatives address him as a chief of national police.Soon after the publication of Paine's \"Dissertation\" a new French\nConstitution was textually submitted for popular consideration.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.Although\nin many respects it accorded fairly well with Paine's principles, it\ncontained one provision which he believed would prove fatal to the\nRepublic.This was the limitation of citizenship to payers of direct\ntaxes, except soldiers who had fought in one or more campaigns for the\nRepublic, this being a sufficient qualification.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.This revolutionary\ndisfranchisement of near half the nation brought Paine to the Convention\n(July 7th) for the first time since the fall of the Brissotins, two\nyears before.A special motion\nwas made by Lan-thenas and unanimously adopted, \"that permission be\ngranted Thomas Paine to deliver his sentiments on the declaration of\nrights and the Constitution.\"With feeble step he ascended the tribune,\nand stood while a secretary read his speech.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.Of all present this man had\nsuffered most by the confusion of the mob with the people, which caused\nthe reaction on which was floated the device he now challenged.It is\nan instance of idealism rare in political history.The speech opens with\nwords that caused emotion.\"Citizens, The effects of a malignant fever, with which I was afflicted\nduring a rigorous confinement in the Luxembourg, have thus long\nprevented me from attending at my post in the bosom of the Convention;\nand the magnitude of the subject under discussion, and no other\nconsideration on earth, could induce me now to repair to my station.A recurrence to the vicissitudes I have experienced, and the critical\nsituations in which I have been placed in consequence of the French\nRevolution, will throw upon what I now propose to submit to the\nConvention the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the\nrectitude of those principles which have uniformly influenced my\nconduct.In England I was proscribed for having vindicated the French\nRevolution, and I have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in France for\nhaving pursued a similar line of conduct.During the reign of terrorism\nI was a prisoner for eight long months, and remained so above three\nmonths after the era of the 10th Thermidor.I ought, however, to state,\nthat I was not persecuted by the _people_, either of England or France.The proceedings in both countries were the effects of the despotism\nexisting in their respective governments.But, even if my persecution\nhad originated in the people at large, my principles and conduct would\nstill have remained the same.Principles which are influenced and\nsubject to the control of tyranny have not their foundation in the\nheart.\"Though they slay him Paine will trust in the people.There seems a\nslight slip of memory; his imprisonment, by revolutionary calendar,\nlasted ten and a half months, or 315 days; but there is no failure\nof conviction or of thought.He points out the inconsistency of the\ndisfranchisement of indirect tax-payers with the Declaration of Rights,\nand the opportunity afforded partisan majorities to influence\nsuffrage by legislation on the mode of collecting taxes.The soldier,\nenfranchised without other qualification, would find his children\nslaves.\"If you subvert the basis of the Revolution, if you dispense with\nprinciples and substitute expedients, you will extinguish that\nenthusiasm which has hitherto been the life and soul of the revolution;\nand you will substitute in its place nothing but a cold indifference and\nself-interest, which will again degenerate into intrigue, cunning, and\neffeminacy.\"There was an educational test of suffrage to which he did not object.\"Where knowledge is a duty, ignorance is a crime.\"But in his appeal to\npure principle simple-hearted Paine knew nothing of the real test of the\nConvention's votes.This white-haired man was the only eminent member\nof the Convention with nothing in his record to cause shame or fear.He\nalmost alone among them had the honor of having risked his head rather\nthan execute Louis, on whom he had looked as one man upon another.He\nalone had refused to enter the Convention when it abandoned the work for\nwhich it was elected and became a usurping tribunal.During two fearful\nyears the true Republic had been in Paine's house and garden, where he\nconversed with his disciples; or in Luxembourg prison, where he won all\nhearts, as did imprisoned George Fox, who reappeared in him, and where,\nbeneath the knife whose fall seemed certain, he criticised consecrated\ndogmas.With this record Paine spoke that day to men who feared to face\nthe honest sentiment of the harried peasantry.Some of the members had\nindeed been terrorized, but a majority shared the disgrace of the old\nConvention.The heart of France was\nthrobbing again, and what would become of these \"Conventionnels,\" when\ntheir assembly should die in giving birth to a government?They must\nfrom potentates become pariahs.Their aim now was to prolong their\npolitical existence.--\n    \"He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound\n    Within the safe and guarded ground:\n    For some foul purpose yet unknown,--\n    Most sure for evil to the throne,--\n    The outlaw'd Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,\n    Has summon'd his rebellious crew;\n    'Tis said, in James of

the Court of Guard,\n    And, struggling with the smoky air,\n    Deaden'd the torches' yellow glare.In comfortless alliance shone\n    The lights through arch of blacken'd stone,\n    And show'd wild shapes in garb of war,\n    Faces deform'd with beard and scar,\n    All haggard from the midnight watch,\n    And fever'd with the stern debauch;\n    For the oak table's massive board,\n    Flooded

mien,\n    Ill suited to the garb and scene,\n    Might lightly bear construction strange,\n    And give loose fancy scope to range.\"Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!Come ye to seek a champion's

flash'd;--she paused and sigh'd,--\n    \"Oh, what have I to do with pride!--\n    Through scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,\n    A suppliant for a father's life,\n    I crave an audience of the King.Behold, to back my suit, a ring,\n    The royal pledge of grateful claims,\n    Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James.\"[340] Tullibardine was an old seat of the Murrays in Perthshire.[341] In the

With deep respect and alter'd look;\n    And said,--\"This ring our duties own;\n    And pardon, if to worth unknown,\n    In semblance mean, obscurely veil'd,\n    Lady, in aught my folly fail'd.Soon as the day flings wide his gates,\n    The King shall know what suitor waits.Please you, meanwhile, in fitting bower\n    Repose you till his waking hour;\n    Female attendance shall obey\n    Your

their guerdon took;\n    But Brent, with shy and awkward look,\n    On the reluctant maiden's hold\n    Forced bluntly back the proffer'd gold;--\n    \"Forgive a haughty English heart,\n    And oh,

could--the maid\n    His rugged courtesy repaid.When Ellen forth with Lewis went,\n    Allan made suit to John of Brent:--\n    \"My lady safe, oh, let your grace\n    Give me to see my master's face!His minstrel I,--to share his doom\n    Bound from the cradle to the tomb.Tenth in descent, since first my sires\n    Waked for his noble house their lyres,\n    Nor one of all the race was known\n    But prized its weal above their own.With the Chief's birth begins our care;\n    Our harp must soothe the infant heir,\n    Teach the youth tales of fight, and grace\n    His earliest feat of field or chase;\n    In peace, in war, our rank we keep,\n    We cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,\n    Nor leave him till we pour our verse--\n    A doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.Then let me share his captive lot;\n    It is my right--deny it not!\"--\n    \"Little we reck,\" said John of Brent,\n    \"We Southern men, of long descent;\n    Nor wot we how a name--a word--\n    Makes

Lay wheel, and ax, and headsman's sword,\n    And many an hideous engine grim,\n    For wrenching joint, and crushing limb,\n    By artist form'd, who deemed it shame\n    And sin to give their work a name.They halted at a low-brow'd porch,\n    And Brent to Allan gave the torch,\n    While bolt and chain he backward roll'd,\n    And made the bar unhasp its hold.They enter'd:--'twas a prison room\n    Of stern security and gloom,\n    Yet not a dungeon; for the day\n    Through lofty gratings found its way,\n    And rude and antique garniture\n    Deck'd the sad walls and oaken floor;\n    Such

fact in mind that the following\nsuggestions have been made.It is an excellent book with which to begin\nthe study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the\nsimpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that\nfollow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the \"Arms and the man I sing,\" of the AEneid, and the\ninvocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, \"Knighthood's\ndauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye,\" and the invocation to the\nHarp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants\nof the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a\ngreat clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated\nthan those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the\nsupernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here\nsupplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest\nof the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story\nof Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the\ngreat epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of\npeople rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story\nof Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan\nagainst the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very\nslight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the\nother, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the\nlove story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the\nbeginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a\nsimple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to\n      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which\n      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the\n      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition\n      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of\n      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of\n      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the\n      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess\n      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the\nbeginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with\nthe problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most\ncases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses\nthe details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of\norder used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find\nand follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness\nof his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls\nin the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must\nleave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and\nelemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the\nspecial topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon\ndescription because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs\nof the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.\n\nI.

again\n     made a spring upon me.We had then a very long and desperate\n     struggle, when he overpowered me and pinned me in a corner of\n     the compartment.At last he got my right thumb into his mouth,\n     holding my hand to steady it with both his hands while he bit\n     it.With a great effort he then bit my thumb off, clean to the\n     bone.I called to the other man to\n     help me, but he seemed stupefied.He called two or three times\n     to the prisoner, 'Leave the poor man alone.The poor man has\n     done thee no harm.'Though sitting within nine inches of my\n     knees he rendered me no help.\"When the prisoner bit my thumb off, he held it in his mouth; he\n     pushed his head through the glass, spat the thumb into his hand\n     and flung it out through the window.I then stood up and put my\n     left hand in my pocket, took out my purse and cried out: 'If it\n     is money you want take all I have.'He made a grab at the purse\n     and flung it through the window, on the same side as the thumb\n     was thrown out.From this act I inferred that I was struggling\n     with a maniac.I retreated to the other end of the compartment,\n     holding the other man between me and the prisoner, but he passed\n     the other man by jumping over the seat and again got hold of me.Then he forced his head through the other window, breaking the\n     glass, and, loosing me for a moment, with his fists smashed the\n     remaining glass in the window.Addressing me he said: 'You ----,\n     you will have to go over;' at the same time he flung both his\n     arms around my waist.I put my leg behind his and threw him on\n     his back.I called upon the other man to help me and he did so.\"We held him down for some time, but he overpowered us and flung\n     us back some distance.He then laid hold of my travelling rug\n     and threw it through the window.Laying his hand on the bottom\n     of the window he cried out, 'Here goes,' and made a leap through\n     the window.I and the other man instantly laid hold of his legs\n     as he was falling over.I got my four fingers into his right\n     shoe, and, his father assisting me, we held him through the\n     window, hanging head downward for about half a mile.I then\n     fainted, and as I was losing my hold on his heels I have some\n     faint recollection that the prisoner's father lost his hold at\n     the same time, and I can't say what happened afterward.As I was\n     coming to myself the train was stopping, and I heard the other\n     man say, 'Oh, my son, my son.'When the train stopped I

thus referring, however, to this instance of British railroad\nconservatism, which with a stolid indifference seems to ignore\nthe teachings of every day life and to meet constantly recurring\nexperience with a calm defiance, it will not do for the American\nrailroad manager to pride himself too much on his own greater\ningenuity and more amenable disposition.The Angola disaster has\nbeen referred to, as well as that at Shipton.If the absence of\nthe bell-cord had indeed any part in the fatality of the latter,\nthe presence in cars crowded with passengers of iron pots full of\nliving fire lent horrors before almost unheard of to the former.The methods of accomplishing needed results which are usual to any\npeople are never easily changed, whether in Europe or in America;\nbut certainly the disasters which have first and last ensued from\nthe failure to devise any safe means of heating passenger coaches\nin this country are out of all proportion to those which can be\nattributed in England to the absence of means of communication\nbetween the passengers on trains and those in charge of them.There\nis an American conservatism as well as an English; and when it comes\nto a question of running risks it would be strange indeed if the\ngreater margin of security were found west of the Atlantic.The\nsecurity afforded by the bell-cord assuredly has not as yet in this\ncountry off-set the danger incident to red-hot stoves.CHAPTER V.\n\nTELESCOPING AND THE MILLER PLATFORM.The period of exemption from wholesale railroad slaughters referred\nto in a previous chapter and which fortunately marked the early days\nof the system, seems to have lasted some eleven years.The record of\ngreat catastrophes opened on the Great Western railway of England,\nand it opened also, curiously enough, upon the 24th of December, a\nday which seems to have been peculiarly unfortunate in the annals\nof that corporation, seeing that it was likewise the date of the\nShipton-on-Cherwell disaster.Upon that day, in 1841, a train, while\nmoving through a thick fog at a high rate of speed, came suddenly\nin contact with a mass of earth that had slid down upon the track\nfrom the <DW72> of the cutting.Instantly the whole rear of the train\nwas piled up on the top of the first carriage, which happened to\nbe crowded with passengers, eight of whom were killed on the spot\nwhile seventeen others were more or less injured.The coroner's\njury returned a verdict of accidental death, and at the same time,\nas if to give the corporation a forcible hint to look closer to the\ncondition of its roadway, a \"deodand\" of one hundred pounds was\nlevied on the locomotive and tender.This practice, by the way,\nof levying a deodand in cases of railroad accidents resulting in\nloss of life, affords a curious illustration of how seldom those\naccidents must have occurred.The mere mention of it now as ever\nhaving existed sounds almost as strange and unreal as would an\nassertion that the corporations had in their earlier days been wont\nto settle their differences by wager of battle.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.Like the wager of\nbattle, the deodand was a feature of the English common law derived\nfrom the feudal period.It was nothing more nor less than a species\nof fine, everything through the instrumentality of which accidental\ndeath occurred being forfeited to the crown; or, in lieu of the\nthing itself, its supposed money value as assessed by a coroner's\njury.[2] Accordingly, down to somewhere about the year 1847, when\nthe practice was finally abolished by act of Parliament, we find in\nall cases of English railroad accidents resulting in death, mention\nof the deodand assessed by coroner's juries on the locomotives.These appear to have been arbitrarily fixed, and graduated in amount\nas the circumstances of the particular accident seemed to excite\nin greater or less degree the sympathies or the indignation of the\njury.In November, 1838, for instance, a locomotive exploded on\nthe Manchester & Liverpool road, killing its engineer and fireman:\nand for this escapade a deodand of twenty pounds was assessed upon\nit by the coroner's jury; while upon another occasion, in 1839,\nwhere the locomotive struck and killed a man and horse at a street\ncrossing, the deodand was fixed at no less a sum than fourteen\nhundred pounds, the full value of the engine.Yet in this last\ncase there did not appear to be any circumstances rendering the\ncorporation liable in civil damages.The deodand seems to have been\nlooked upon as a species of rude penalty imposed on the use of\ndangerous appliances,--a sharp reminder to the corporations to look\nclosely after their locomotives and employ\u00e9s.As, however, accidents\nincreased in frequency it became painfully apparent that \"crowner's\n'quest law\" was not in any appreciable degree better calculated to\ncommand the public respect in the days of Victoria than in those of\nElizabeth, and the ancient usage was accordingly at last abolished.Certainly the position of railroad corporations would now be even\nmore hazardous than it is, if, after every catastrophe resulting\nin death, the coroner's jury of the vicinage enjoyed the power of\narbitrarily imposing on them such additional penalty not exceeding\nthe value of a locomotive, in addition to all other liabilities, as\nmight seem to it proper under the circumstances of the case.[2] \"_Deodand._ By this is meant whatever personal chattel is\n  the immediate occasion of the death of any reasonable creature:\n  which is forfeited to the king, to be applied to pious uses, and\n  distributed in alms by his high almoner; though formerly destined\n  to a more superstitious purpose.* * * Wherever the thing is in\n  motion, not only that part which immediately gives the wounds\n  (as the wheel which runs over his body,) but all things which\n  move with it and help to make the wound more dangerous, (as the\n  cart and loading, which increase the pressure of the wheel) are\n  forfeited.\"--_Blackstone, Book I, Chap.8, XVI._\n\nRecurring, however, to the accident of December 24, 1861, the\nnumerous casualties in that case were due to the crushing of the\nrolling stock which was not strong enough to resist the shock of\nthe sudden stop.Under these circumstances the light, short English\ncarriages rode over each other and were broken to pieces; under\nsimilar circumstances the longer and heavier cars then in use in\nAmerica would have \"telescoped;\" that is, the platforms between the\ncars would have been broken off and the forward end of each car\nriding slightly up on its broken coupling would have shot in over\nthe floor of the car before it, sweeping away the studding and other\nlight wood-work and crushing stoves, seats and passengers into one\ninextricable mass, until, if the momentum was sufficiently great,\nthe several vehicles in the train would be enclosed in each other\nsomewhat like the slides of a partially shut telescope.Crushing in other countries and telescoping in America were formerly\nthe greatest, if not the worst, dangers to which travel by rail\nwas liable.As respects crushing there is little to be said.It is\na mere question of proportions,--resisting strength opposed to\nmomentum.So long as trains go at great speed it is inevitable that\nthey will occasionally be brought to a dead-stand by running upon\nunexpected obstacles.The simple wonder is that they do this so\ninfrequently.When, however, now and again, they are thus brought\nto a dead-stand the safety of the passenger depends and can depend\non nothing but the strength of the car in which he is sitting as\nmeasured by the force of the shock to which it is subjected.This\nmatter has already been referred to in connection with the Shipton\nand Wollaston accidents,[3] the last of which was a significant\nreminder to all railroad managers that no matter how strongly or\nwith how careful a regard to scientific principles cars may be\nconstructed, just so long as they are made by human hands it is easy\nto load on weight sufficient, when combined with only a moderate\nmomentum, to crush them into splinters.Telescoping, however, was an incident of crushing, and a peculiarly\nAmerican incident, which is not without a certain historical\ninterest; for the particular feature in car construction which\nled directly to it and all its attendant train of grisly horrors\nfurnishes a singular and instructive illustration of the gross\nviolations of mechanical principles into which practical, as opposed\nto educated, mechanics are apt constantly to fall,--and in which,\nwhen once they have fallen, they steadily persist.The original\nidea of the railroad train was a succession of stage coaches chained\ntogether and hauled by a locomotive.The famous pioneer train of\nAugust 9, 1831, over the Mohawk Valley road was literally made up\nin this way, the bodies of stage coaches having been placed on\ntrucks, which \"were coupled together with chains or chain-links,\nleaving from two to three feet slack, and when the locomotive\nstarted it took up the slack by jerks, with sufficient force to jerk\nthe passengers, who sat on seats across the tops of the coaches,\nout from under their hats, and in stopping they came together with\nsuch force as to send them flying from their seats.\"On this trip,\nit will be remembered, the train presently came to a stop, when\nthe passengers upon it, with true American adaptability, set their\nwits at once to the work of devising some means of remedying the\nunpleasant jerks.[4] \"A plan was soon hit upon and put in execution.The three links in the couplings of the cars were stretched to their\nutmost tension, a rail, from a fence in the neighborhood, was placed\nbetween each pair of cars and made fast by means of the packing yarn\nfrom the cylinders.\"Here was the incipient idea of couplers and\nbuffers improvised by practical men, and for a third of a century\nit remained almost unimproved upon, except by the introduction\nof a spring upon which coupler and buffer played.The only other\nconsiderable change made in the earlier days of car construction\nwas by no means an improvement, inasmuch as it introduced the new\nand wholly unnecessary danger of telescoping.[4] Railroads: their Origin and Problems, p.The original passenger cars, however frail and light they may have\nbeen, were at least, when shackled together in a train, continuous\nin their bearings on each other,--that is, their sills and floor\ntimbers were all on a level and in line, so that, if the cars were\nsuddenly pressed together, they met in such a way as to resist the\npressure to the extent of their resisting power, and the floor\nof one did not quietly slide under or over that of another.The\nbodies of these cars were about thirty-two inches from the rails.In raising the bodies\nof the cars, however, the mechanics of those days encountered a\npractical difficulty.The couplings of the cars built on the new\nmodel were higher than those of the old.They at once met, and,\nas they thought, no less ingeniously then successfully overcame\nthis difficulty, by placing the couplings and draw-heads of their\nnew cars below the line of the sills.This necessitated putting\nthe platform which sustained the coupling also beneath the sills,\nand in doing that they disregarded, without the most remote\nconsciousness of the fact, a fundamental law of mechanics.With a\npossible pressure, both sudden and heavy to be resisted, the line\nof resistance was no longer the line of greatest strength.During\nthirty years this stupid blunder remained uncorrected.It was as\nif the builders during that period had from force of habit insisted\nupon always using as supports pillars which were curved or bent\ninstead of upright.At the close of those thirty years also the\nrailroad mechanics had become so thoroughly educated into their\nfalse methods that it took yet other years and a series of frightful\ndisasters, the significance of which they seemed utterly unable to\ntake in, before they could be induced to abandon those methods.The two great dangers of telescoping and oscillation were directly\ndue to this system of car construction and of train coupling,--and\ntelescoping and oscillation were probably the cause of one-half at\nleast of the loss of life and the injuries to persons incident to\nthe first thirty years of American railroad experience.The badly\nbuilt and loosely connected coaches of every train going at any\nconsiderable rate of speed used then to swing and roll about and\nhammer against each other after a fashion which made the infrequent\noccurrence of serious disaster the only fair subject for surprise.In case of a sudden stoppage or partial derailment, the train\nstopped or went on, not as a whole, but as a succession of parts,\nwhile the low platforms and slack couplings fearfully increased\nthe danger;--for, if the train held together, the cars in stopping\nwere likely to break off the platforms, making of what remained of\nthem a sort of inclined plane over which the car-bodies rode into\neach other at different levels; or, if the couplings, as was more\nprobable, held and the train did not part, the swaying and swinging\nof the loosely connected cars was almost sure to throw them from\nthe track and break them in pieces.The invention through which\nthis difficulty was at last overcome, simple and obvious as it was,\nis fairly entitled, so far as America at least is concerned, to be\nclassed among the four or five really noticeable advances which\nhave of late years been made in railroad appliances.It contributed\nunmistakably and essentially to the safety of every traveller.Known\nas the Miller platform and buffer, from the name of the inventor,\nit was, like all good work of the sort, a simple and intelligent\nrecurrence to correct mechanical principles.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.Miller went to work to\nconstruct cars in such a way as to cause them to come in contact\nwith each other in the line of their greatest resisting power, while\nin coupling them together in trains he introduced both tension and\ncompression;--that is he, in plain language, brought the ends of\nthe heavy longitudinal floor timbers of the separate cars exactly\non a line and directly bearing on each other, and then forced them\nagainst each other until the heavy spring buffers which played\non those floor timbers were compressed, when the couplers sprung\ntogether and the train then stood practically one solid body from\nend to end.It could no more swing or crush than a single car could\nswing or crush.It then only remained to increase the weight and to\nperfect the construction of the vehicles to insure all the safety in\nthis respect of which travel by rail admitted.Simple as these improvements were, and apparently obvious as the\nmechanical principles on which they were based now seem, the\nopposition for years offered to them by practical master-mechanics\nand railroad men would have been ludicrous had it not been\nexasperating.There was hardly a railroad in the country whose\nofficers did not insist that their method of construction was\nexceptional, it was true, but far better than Miller's.It was\nmaintained that the slack couplings were necessary in order to\nenable the locomotives to start the trains,--that a train made up\nwithout the slack, on Miller's plan, could not be set in motion,\nand that if it was set in motion it must twist apart at every sharp\ncurve etc.The ingenuity displayed in thus inventing theoretical\nobjections to the appliance far exceeded that required for inventing\nit, and indeed no one who has not had official experience of it\ncan at all realize the objecting capacity of the typical practical\nmechanic whose conceit as a rule is measured by his ignorance,\nwhile his stupidity is unequalled save by his obstinacy.Even when\nMiller's invention for one reason or another was not adopted, the\nprinciples upon which that invention was founded,--the principles\nof tension, cohesion and direct resistance,--at last forced their\nway into general acceptance.The long-urged objection that the\nthing was practically impossible was slowly abandoned in face of\nthe awkward but undeniable fact that it was done every day, and\nmany times a day.Consequently, as the result of much patient\narguing, duly emphasized by the regular recurrence of disaster,\nit is not too much to assert that for weight, resisting power,\nperfection of construction and equipment and the protection they\nafford to travellers, the standard American passenger coach is now\nfar in advance of any other.As to comfort, convenience, taste\nin ornamentation, etc., these are so much matters of habit and\neducation that it is unnecessary to discuss them.They do not affect\nthe question of safety.A very striking illustration of the vast increase of safety secured\nthrough this improved car construction was furnished in an accident,\nwhich happened in Massachusetts upon July 15, 1872.As an express\ntrain on the Boston & Providence road was that day running to Boston\nabout noon and at a rate of speed of some forty miles an hour, it\ncame in contact with a horse and wagon at a grade crossing in the\ntown of Foxborough.The train was made up of thoroughly well-built\ncars, equipped with both the Miller platform and the Westinghouse\ntrain-brake.There was no time in which to check the speed, and it\nthus became a simple question of strength of construction, to be\ntested in an unavoidable collision.The engine struck the wagon, and\ninstantly destroyed it.The horse had already cleared the rails when\nthe wagon was struck, but, a portion of his harness getting caught\non the locomotive, he was thrown down and dragged a short distance\nuntil his body came in contact with the platform of a station close\nto the spot of collision.The body was then forced under the cars,\nhaving been almost instantaneously rolled and pounded up into a\nhard, unyielding mass.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the milk.The results which ensued were certainly\nvery singular.Next to the locomotive was an ordinary baggage and\nmail car, and it was under this car, and between its forward and\nits hind truck, that the body of the horse was forced; coming then\ndirectly in contact with the truck of the rear wheels, it tore it\nfrom its fastenings and thus let the rear end of the car drop upon\nthe track.In falling, this end snapped the coupling by its weight,\nand so disconnected the train, the locomotive going off towards\nBoston dragging this single car, with one end of it bumping along\nthe track.Meanwhile the succeeding car of the train had swept over\nthe body of the horse and the disconnected truck, which were thus\nbrought in contact with its own wheels, which in their turn were\nalso torn off; and so great was the momentum that in this way all of\nthe four passenger cars which composed that part of the train were\nsuccessively driven clean off their rolling gear, and not only did\nthey then slide off the track, but they crossed a railroad siding\nwhich happened to be at that point, went down an embankment three or\nfour feet in height, demolished a fence, passed into an adjoining\nfield, and then at last, after glancing from the stump of a large\noak-tree, they finally came to a stand-still some two hundred feet\nfrom the point at which they had left the track.There was not in\nthis case even an approach to telescoping; on the contrary, each car\nrested perfectly firmly in its place as regarded all the others, not\na person was injured, and when the wheel-less train at last became\nstationary the astonished passengers got up and hurried through the\ndoors, the very glass in which as well as that in the windows was\nunbroken.Here was an indisputable victory of skill and science over\naccident, showing most vividly to what an infinitesimal extreme the\ndangers incident to telescoping may be reduced.The vast progress in this direction made within twenty years can,\nhowever, best perhaps be illustrated by the results of two accidents\nalmost precisely similar in character, which occurred, the one on\nthe Great Western railroad of Canada, in October, 1854, the other\non the Boston & Albany, in Massachusetts, in October, 1874.In the\nfirst case a regular train made up of a locomotive and seven cars,\nwhile approaching Detroit at a speed of some twenty miles an hour,\nran into a gravel train of fifteen cars which was backing towards\nit at a speed of some ten miles an hour.The locomotive of the\npassenger train was thrown completely off the track and down the\nembankment, dragging after it a baggage car.At the head of the\npassenger portion of the train were two second-class cars filled\nwith emigrants; both of these were telescoped and demolished,\nand all their unfortunate occupants either killed or injured.The\nfront of the succeeding first-class car was then crushed in, and a\nnumber of those in it were hurt.In all, no less than forty-seven\npersons lost their lives, while sixty others were maimed or severely\nbruised.So much for a collision in October, 1854.In October, 1874,\non the Boston & Albany road, the regular New York express train,\nconsisting of a locomotive and seven cars, while going during the\nnight at a speed of forty miles an hour, was suddenly, near the\nBrimfield station, thrown by a misplaced switch into a siding upon\nwhich a number of platform freight cars were standing.The train was\nthoroughly equipped, having both Miller platform and Westinghouse\nbrake.The six seconds which intervened, in the darkness, between\nnotice of displacement and the collision did not enable the engineer\nto check perceptibly the speed of his train, and when the blow came\nit was a simple question of strength to resist.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.The shock must\nhave been tremendous, for the locomotive and tender were flung off\nthe track to the right and the baggage car to the left, the last\nbeing thrown across the interval between the siding and the main\ntrack and resting obliquely over the latter.The forward end of the\nfirst passenger coach was thrown beyond the baggage car up over\nthe tender, and its rear end, as well as the forward end of the\nsucceeding coach, was injured.As in the Foxborough case, several\nof the trucks were jerked out from under the cars to which they\nbelonged, but not a person on the train was more than slightly\nbruised, the cars were not disconnected, nor was there even a\nsuggestion of telescoping.Going back once more to the early days, a third of a century\nsince, before yet the periodical recurrence of slaughter had\ncaused either train-brake or Miller platform to be imagined as\npossibilities, before, indeed, there was yet any record of what\nwe would now consider a regular railroad field-day, with its long\ntrain of accompanying horrors, including in the grisly array death\nby crushing, scalding, drowning, burning, and impalement,--going\nback to the year 1840, or thereabouts, we find that the railroad\ncompanies experienced a notable illustration of the truth of the\nancient adage that it never rains but it pours; for it was then\nthat the long immunity was rudely broken in upon.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the milk.After that time\ndisasters on the rail seemed to tread upon one another's heels\nin quick and frightful succession.Within a few months of the\nEnglish catastrophe of December 24, 1841, there happened in France\none of the most famous and most horrible railroad slaughters\never recorded.It took place on the 8th of May, 1842.It was the\nbirthday of the king, Louis Philippe, and, in accordance with the\nusual practice, the occasion had been celebrated at Versailles by a\ngreat display of the fountains.At half past five o'clock these had\nstopped playing, and a general rush ensued for the trains then about\nto leave for Paris.That which went by the road along the left bank\nof the Seine was densely crowded, and so long that two locomotives\nwere required to draw it.As it was moving at a high rate of speed\nbetween Bellevue and Meudon, the axle of the foremost of these\ntwo locomotives broke, letting the body of the engine drop to the\nground.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.It instantly stopped, and the second locomotive was then\ndriven by its impetus on top of the first, crushing its engineer and\nfireman, while the contents of both the fire-boxes were scattered\nover the roadway and among the _d\u00e9bris_.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.Three carriages crowded\nwith passengers were then piled on top of this burning mass and\nthere crushed together into each other.The doors of these carriages\nwere locked, as was then and indeed is still the custom in Europe,\nand it so chanced that they had all been newly painted.They blazed\nup like pine kindlings.Some of the carriages were so shattered that\na portion of those in them were enabled to extricate themselves, but\nthe very much larger number were held fast; and of these such as\nwere not so fortunate as to be crushed to death in the first shock\nperished hopelessly in the flames before the eyes of a throng of\nlookers-on impotent to aid.Fifty-two or fifty-three persons were\nsupposed to have lost their lives in this disaster, and more than\nforty others were injured; the exact number of the killed, however,\ncould never be ascertained, as the piling-up of the cars on top of\nthe two locomotives had made of the destroyed portion of the train\na veritable holocaust of the most hideous description.Not only did\nwhole families perish together,--in one case no less than eleven\nmembers of the same family sharing a common fate,--but the remains\nof such as were destroyed could neither be identified nor separated.In one case a female foot was alone recognizable, while in others\nthe bodies were calcined and and fused into an indistinguishable\nmass.The Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to inquire\nwhether Admiral D'Urville, a distinguished French navigator, was\namong the victims.His body was thought to be found, but it was so\nterribly mutilated that it could be recognized only by a sculptor,\nwho chanced some time before to have taken a phrenological cast of\nthe skull.His wife and only son had perished with him.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.It is not easy now to conceive the excitement and dismay which this\ncatastrophe caused throughout France.The railroad was at once\nassociated in the minds of an excitable people with novel forms\nof imminent death.France had at best been laggard enough in its\nadoption of the new invention, and now it seemed for a time as if\nthe Versailles disaster was to operate as a barrier in the way of\nall further railroad development.Persons availed themselves of the\nsteam roads already constructed as rarely as possible, and then in\nfear and trembling, while steps were taken to substitute horse for\nsteam power on other roads then in process of construction.The disaster was, indeed, one well calculated to make a deep\nimpression on the popular mind, for it lacked almost no attribute of\nthe dramatic and terrible.There were circumstances connected with\nit, too, which gave it a sort of moral significance,--contrasting\nso suddenly the joyous return from the country _f\u00eate_ in the\npleasant afternoon of May, with what De Quincey has called the\nvision of sudden death.It contained a whole homily on the familiar\ntext.As respects the number of those killed and injured, also,\nthe Versailles accident has not often been surpassed; perhaps\nnever in France.In this country it was surpassed on one occasion,\namong others, under circumstances very similar to it.This was the\naccident at Camphill station, about twelve miles from Philadelphia,\non July 17, 1856, which befell an excursion train carrying some\neleven hundred children, who had gone out on a Sunday-school picnic\nin charge of their teachers and friends.The road had but a single track, and the\ntrain, both long and heavy, had been delayed and was running behind\nits schedule time.The conductor thought, however, that the next\nstation could yet be reached in time to meet and there pass a\nregular train coming towards him.It may have been a miscalculation\nof seconds, it may have been a difference of watches, or perhaps\nthe regular train was slightly before its time; but, however it\nhappened, as the excursion train, while running at speed, was\nrounding a reverse curve, it came full upon the regular train, which\nhad just left the station.In those days, as compared with the\npresent, the cars were but egg-shells, and the shock was terrific.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.The locomotives struck each other, and, after rearing themselves\nup for an instant, it is said, like living animals, fell to the\nground mere masses of rubbish.In any case the force of the shock\nwas sufficient to hurl both engines from the track and lay them side\nby side at right angles to, and some distance from it.As only the\nexcursion train happened to be running at speed, it alone had all\nthe impetus necessary for telescoping; three of its cars accordingly\nclosed in upon each other, and the children in them were", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "It would be hard to imagine anything more thoroughly\nheart-rending, for the holocaust was of little children on a party\nof pleasure.Five cars in all were burned, and sixty-six persons\nperished; the injured numbered more than a hundred.[5]\n\n  [5] A collision very similar to that at Camphill occurred upon the\n  Erie railway at a point about 20 miles west of Port Jervis on the\n  afternoon of July 15, 1864.The train in this case consisted of\n  eighteen cars, in which were some 850 Confederate soldiers on their\n  way under guard to the prisoner's camp at Elmira.A coal train\n  consisting of 50 loaded cars from the hanch took the main line at\n  Lackawaxen.The telegraph operator there informed its conductor that\n  the track was clear, and, while rounding a sharp reversed curve,\n  the two trains came together, the one going at about twelve and the\n  other at some twenty miles an hour.Some 60 of the soldiers, besides\n  a number of train hands were killed on the spot, and 120 more were\n  seriously injured, some of them fatally.This disaster occurred in the midst of some of the most important\n  operations of the Rebellion and excited at the time hardly any\n  notice.There was a suggestive military promptness in the subsequent\n  proceedings.\"T. J. Ridgeway, Esq., Associate Judge of Pike County,\n  was soon on the spot, and, after consultation with Mr.Riddle [the\n  superintendent of the Erie road] and the officer in command of the\n  men, a jury was impanneled and an inquest held; after which a large\n  trench was dug by the soldiers and the railway employ\u00e9s, 76 feet\n  long, 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep, in which the bodies were at once\n  interred in boxes, hastily constructed--one being allotted to four\n  rebels, and one to each Union soldier.\"There were sixteen of the\n  latter killed.Of this disaster nothing could be said either in excuse or in\nextenuation; it was not only one of the worst description, but\nit was one of that description the occurrence of which is most\nfrequent.An excursion train, while running against time on a\nsingle-track road, came in collision with a regular train.The\nrecord is full of similar disasters, too numerous to admit of\nspecific reference.Primarily of course, the conductors of the\nspecial trains are as a rule in fault in such cases.He certainly\nwas at Camphill, and felt himself to be so, for the next day he\ncommitted suicide by swallowing arsenic.But in reality in these\nand in all similar cases,--both those which have happened and those\nhereafter surely destined to happen,--the full responsibility\ndoes not rest upon the unfortunate or careless subordinate;--nor\nshould the weight of punishment be visited upon him.At this late day no board of directors, nor president,\nnor superintendent has any right to operate a single track road\nwithout the systematic use of the telegraph in connection with its\ntrain movements.That the telegraph can be used to block, as it is\ntermed, double-track roads, by dividing them into sections upon no\none of which two trains can be running at the same time, is matter\nof long and daily experience.There is nothing new or experimental\nabout it.It is a system which has been forced on the more crowded\nlines of the world as an alternative to perennial killings.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.That\nin the year 1879 excursion trains should rush along single-track\nroads and hurl themselves against regular trains, just as was done\ntwenty-three years ago at Camphill, would be deemed incredible were\nnot exactly similar accidents still from time to time reported.Louis, for instance, on July 4, 1879.The\nsimple fact is that to now operate single-track roads without the\nconstant aid of the telegraph, as a means of blocking them for every\nirregular train, indicates a degree of wanton carelessness, or an\nexcess of incompetence, for which adequate provision should be made\nin the criminal law.Nothing but this appeal to the whipping-post,\nas it were, seems to produce the needed mental activity; for it is\ndifficult to realize the stupid conservatism of ordinary men when\nbrought to the consideration of something to which they are not\naccustomed.On this very point of controlling the train movement\nof single-track roads by telegraph, for instance, within a very\nrecent period the superintendent of a leading Massachusetts road\ngravely assured the railroad commissioners of that state, that he\nconsidered it a most dangerous reliance which had occasioned many\ndisasters, and that he had no doubt it would be speedily abandoned\nas a practice in favor of the old time-table and running-rules\nsystem, from which no deviations would be allowed.This opinion\nwas expressed, also, after the Revere disaster of 1871, it might\nhave been supposed, had branded into the record of the state the\nimpossibility of safely running any crowded railroad in a reliance\nupon the schedule.[6] Such men as this, however, are not accessible\nto argument or the teachings of experience, and the gentle stimulant\nof a criminal prosecution seems to be the only thing left.And yet, even with the wires in active use, collisions will\noccasionally take place.They have sometimes, indeed, even been\ncaused by the telegraph, so that railroad officials at two adjacent\nstations on the same road, having launched trains at each other\nbeyond recall, have busied themselves while waiting for tidings of\nthe inevitable collision in summoning medical assistance for those\nsure soon to be injured.In such cases, however, the mishap can\nalmost invariably be traced to some defect in the system under which\nthe telegraph is used;--such as a neglect to exact return messages\nto insure accuracy, or the delegating to inexperienced subordinates\nthe work which can be properly performed only by a principal.This\nwas singularly illustrated in a terrible collision which took place\nat Thorpe, between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, on the Great Eastern\nRailway in England, on the 10th of September, 1874.The line had\nin this place but a single track, and the mail train to Norwich,\nunder the rule, had to wait at a station called Brundell until the\narrival there of the evening express from Yarmouth, or until it\nreceived permission by the telegraph to proceed.On the evening of\nthe disaster the express train was somewhat behind its time, and\nthe inspector wrote a dispatch directing the mail to come forward\nwithout waiting for it.This dispatch he left in the telegraph\noffice unsigned, while he went to attend to other matters.Just then\nthe express train came along, and he at once allowed it to proceed.Hardly was it under way when the unsigned dispatch occurred to him,\nand the unfortunate man dashed to the telegraph office only to learn\nthat the operator had forwarded it.Under the rules of the company\nno return message was required.A second dispatch was instantly sent\nto Brundell to stop the mail; the reply came back that the mail was\ngone.The two trains were of very equal weight, the one consisting of\nfourteen and the other of thirteen carriages.They were both drawn\nby powerful locomotives, the drivers of which had reason for putting\non an increased speed, believing, as each had cause to believe, that\nthe other was waiting for him.The night was intensely dark and\nit was raining heavily, so that, even if the brakes were applied,\nthe wheels would slide along the slippery track.Under these\ncircumstances the two trains rushed upon each other around a slight\ncurve which sufficed to conceal their head-lights.The combined\nmomentum must have amounted to little less than sixty miles an\nhour, and the shock was heard through all the neighboring village.The smoke-stack of the locomotive drawing the mail train was swept\naway as the other locomotive seemed to rush on top of it, while\nthe carriages of both trains followed until a mound of locomotives\nand shattered cars was formed which the descending torrents alone\nhindered from becoming a funeral pyre.So sudden was the collision\nthat the driver of one of the engines did not apparently have an\nopportunity to shut off the steam, and his locomotive, though forced\nfrom the track and disabled, yet remained some time in operation in\nthe midst of the wreck.In both trains, very fortunately, there were\na number of empty cars between the locomotives and the carriages in\nwhich the passengers were seated, and they were utterly demolished;\nbut for this fortunate circumstance the Thorpe collision might well\nhave proved the most disastrous of all railroad accidents.As it\nwas, the men on both the locomotives were instantly killed, together\nwith seventeen passengers, and four other passengers subsequently\ndied of their injuries; making a total of twenty-five deaths,\nbesides fifty cases of injury.It would be difficult to conceive of a more violent collision\nthan that which has just been described; and yet, as curiously\nillustrating the rapidity with which the force of the most severe\nshock is expended, it is said that two gentlemen in the last\ncarriage of one of the trains, finding it at a sudden standstill\nclose to the place to which they were going, supposed it had stopped\nfor some unimportant cause and concluded to take advantage of a\nhappy chance which left them almost at the doors of their homes.They accordingly got out and hurried away in the rain, learning\nonly the next morning of the catastrophe in which they had been\nunconscious participants.The collision at Thorpe occurred in September, 1874.Seven months\nlater, on the 4th of April, 1875, there was an accident similar\nto it in almost every respect, except fatality, on the Burlington\n& Missouri road in Iowa.In this case the operator at Tyrone had\ntelegraphic orders to hold the east-bound passenger express at that\npoint to meet the west-bound passenger express.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.This order he failed\nto deliver, and the train accordingly at once went on to the usual\npassing place at the next station.It was midnight and intensely\ndark, with a heavy mist in the air which at times thickened to rain.Both of the trains approaching each other were made up in the way\nusual with through night trains on the great western lines, and\nconsisted of locomotives, baggage and smoking cars, behind which\nwere the ordinary passenger cars of the company followed by several\nheavy Pullman sleeping coaches.Those in charge of the east-bound\ntrain, knowing that it was behind time, were running it rapidly,\nso as to delay as little as possible the west-bound train, which,\nhaving received the order to pass at Tyrone was itself being run at\nspeed.Both trains were thus moving at some thirty-five miles an\nhour, when suddenly in rounding a sharp curve they came upon each\nother.Indeed so close were they that the west-bound engineer had no\ntime in which to reverse, but, jumping straight from the gangway,\nhe afterwards declared that the locomotives came together before he\nreached the ground.The engineer of the east-bound train succeeded\nboth in reversing his locomotive and in applying his airbrake, but\nafter reversal the throttle flew open.The trains came together,\ntherefore, as at Thorpe, with their momentum practically unchecked,\nand with such force that the locomotives were completely demolished,\nthe boilers of the two, though on the same line of rails, actually,\nin some way, passing each other.The baggage-cars were also\ndestroyed, and the smoking cars immediately behind them were more\nor less damaged, but the remaining coaches of each train stood\nupon the tracks so wholly uninjured that four hours later, other\nlocomotives having been procured but the track being still blocked,\nthe passengers were transferred from one set of cars to the other,\nand in them were carried to their destinations.So admirably did\nMiller's construction serve its purpose in this case, that, while\nthe superintendent of the road, who happened to be in the rear\nsleeping car of one of the trains, merely reported that he \"felt the\nshock quite sensibly,\" passengers in the rear coaches of the other\ntrain hardly felt it at all.At Tyrone the wrecks of the trains caught fire from the stoves\nthrown out of the baggage cars and from the embers from the\nfire-boxes of the locomotives, but the flames were speedily\nextinguished.Of the train hands three were killed and two injured,\nbut no passenger was more than shaken or slightly bruised.This\nwas solely due to strength of car construction.Heavy as the shock\nwas,--so heavy that in the similar case at Thorpe the carriages were\ncrushed like nut-shells under it,--the resisting power was equal to\nit.The failure of appliances at one point in the operation of the\nroad was made good by their perfection at another.Similar in some of its more dramatic features to the Versailles\naccident, though originating from a wholly different cause, was the\nAbergele disaster, which at the time occupied the attention of the\nBritish public to the exclusion of everything else.It occurred\nin 1868, and to the \"Irish mail,\" perhaps the most famous train\nwhich is run in England, if, indeed, not in the world.Leaving\nLondon shortly after 7 A.M., the Irish mail was then timed to make\nthe distance to Chester, 166 miles, in four hours and eighteen\nminutes, or at the rate of 40 miles an hour.For the next 85 miles,\ncompleting the run to Holyhead, the speed was somewhat increased,\ntwo hours and five minutes only being allowed for it.Abergele is a\npoint on the sea-coast of Wales, nearly midway between Chester and\nHolyhead.On the day of the accident, August 20, 1868, the Irish\nmail left Chester as usual.It was made up of thirteen carriages\nin all, which were occupied, as the carriages of that train usually\nwere, by a large number of persons whose names at least were widely\nknown.Among these, on this particular occasion, was the Duchess of\nAbercorn, wife of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with five\nchildren.Under the running arrangements of the London & North\nWestern road a freight, or as it is there called a goods train, left\nChester half an hour before the mail, and was placed upon the siding\nat Llanddulas, a station about a mile and a half beyond Abergele,\nto allow the mail to pass.From Abergele to Llanddulas the track\nascended by a gradient of some sixty feet to the mile.On the day of\nthe accident it chanced that certain wagons between the engine and\nthe rear end of the goods train had to be taken out to be left at\nLlanddulas, and in doing this it became necessary to separate the\ntrain and to leave five or six of the last wagons in it standing on\nthe tracks of the main line, while those which were to be left were\nbacked onto a siding.The employ\u00e9, whose duty it was, neglected to\nset the brakes on the wagons thus left standing, and consequently\nwhen the engine and the rest of the train returned for them, the\nmoment they were touched and before a coupling could be effected,\nthe jar set them in motion down the incline towards Abergele.They\nstarted so slowly that a brakeman of the train ran after them,\nfully expecting to catch and stop them, but as they went down the\ngrade they soon outstripped him and it became clear that there was\nnothing to check them until they should meet the Irish mail, then\nalmost due.It also chanced that the cars thus set in motion were\noil cars.The track of the North Western road between Abergele and Llanddulas\nruns along the sides of the picturesque Welsh hills, which rise\nup to the south, while to the north there stretches out a wide\nexpanse of sea.The mail train was skirting the hills and laboring\nup the grade at a speed of thirty miles an hour, when its engineer\nsuddenly became aware of the loose wagons coming down upon it around\nthe curve, and then but a few yards off.Seeing that they were oil\ncars he almost instinctively sprang from his locomotive, and was\nthrown down by the impetus and rolled to the side of the road-bed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.Picking himself up, bruised but not seriously hurt, he saw that\nthe collision had already taken place, that the tender had ridden\ndirectly over the engine, that the colliding cars were demolished,\nand that the foremost carriages of the train were already on fire.Running quickly to the rear of the train he succeeded in uncoupling\nsix carriages and a van, which were drawn away from the rest, before\nthe flames extended to them, by an engine which most fortunately was\nfollowing the train.All the other carriages were utterly destroyed,\nand every person in them perished.The Abergele was probably the solitary instance of a railroad\naccident in which but a single survivor sustained any injury.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.The collision was\nnot a particularly severe one, and the engineer of the mail train\nespecially stated that at the moment it occurred the loose cars were\nstill moving so slowly that he would not have sprung from his engine\nhad he not seen that they were loaded with oil.The very instant\nthe collision took place, however, the fluid seemed to ignite and\nto flash along the train like lightning, so that it was impossible\nto approach a carriage when once it caught fire.The fact was that\nthe oil in vast quantities was spilled upon the track and ignited by\nthe fire of the locomotive, and then the impetus of the mail train\nforced all of its leading carriages into the dense mass of smoke and\nflame.All those who were present concurred in positively stating\nthat not a cry, nor a moan, nor a sound of any description was heard\nfrom the burning carriages, nor did any one in them apparently make\nan effort to escape.The most graphic description of this extraordinary and terrible\ncatastrophe was that given by the Marquis of Hamilton, the eldest\nson of the Duke of Abercorn whose wife and family, fortunately\nfor themselves, occupied one of those rear carriages which were\nunshackled and saved.In this account the Marquis of Hamilton\nsaid:--\"We were startled by a collision and a shock which, though\nnot very severe, were sufficient to throw every one against his\nopposite neighbor.I immediately jumped out of the carriage,\nwhen a fearful sight met my view.Already the whole of the three\npassengers' carriages in front of ours, the vans, and the engine\nwere enveloped in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising fully\ntwenty feet high, and spreading out in every direction.No words can convey the instantaneous nature\nof the explosion and conflagration.I had actually got out almost\nbefore the shock of the collision was over, and this was the\nspectacle which already presented itself.Not a sound, not a scream,\nnot a struggle to escape, not a movement of any sort was apparent\nin the doomed carriages.It was as though an electric flash had\nat once paralyzed and stricken every one of their occupants.So\ncomplete was the absence of any presence of living or struggling\nlife in them that as soon as the passengers from the other parts\nof the train were in some degree recovered from their first shock\nand consternation, it was imagined that the burning carriages were\ndestitute of passengers; a hope soon changed into feelings of horror\nwhen their contents of charred and mutilated remains were discovered\nan hour afterward.From the extent, however, of the flames, the\nsuddenness of the conflagration, and the absence of any power to\nextricate themselves, no human aid would have been of any assistance\nto the sufferers, who, in all probability, were instantaneously\nsuffocated by the black and fetid smoke peculiar to paraffine, which\nrose in volumes around the spreading flames.\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.Though the collision took place before one o'clock, in spite\nof the efforts of a large gang of men who were kept throwing\nwater on the tracks, the perfect sea of flame which covered the\nline for a distance of some forty or fifty yards could not be\nextinguished until nearly eight o'clock in the evening; for the\npetroleum had flowed down into the ballasting of the road, and the\nrails themselves were red-hot.It was therefore small occasion\nfor surprise that, when the fire was at last gotten under, the\nremains of those who lost their lives were in some cases wholly\nundistinguishable, and in others almost so.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.Among the thirty-three\nvictims of the disaster the body of no single one retained any\ntraces of individuality; the faces of all were wholly destroyed,\nand in no case were there found feet, or legs, or anything at all\napproaching to a perfect head.Ten corpses were finally identified\nas those of males, and thirteen as those of females, while the sex\nof ten others could not be determined.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.The body of one passenger,\nLord Farnham, was identified by the crest on his watch; and, indeed,\nno better evidence of the wealth and social position of the victims\nof this accident could have been asked for than the collection of\narticles found on its site.It included diamonds of great size\nand singular brilliancy; rubies, opals, emeralds, gold tops of\nsmelling-bottles, twenty-four watches, of which but two or three\nwere not gold, chains, clasps of bags, and very many bundles of\nkeys.Of these the diamonds alone had successfully resisted the\nintense heat of the flame; the settings were nearly all destroyed.Of the causes of this accident little need or can be said.No human\nappliances, no more ingenious brakes or increased strength of\nconstruction, could have averted it or warded off its consequences\nonce it was inevitable.It was occasioned primarily by two things,\nthe most dangerous and the most difficult to reach of all the\nmany sources of danger against which those managing railroads\nhave unsleepingly to contend:--a somewhat defective discipline,\naggravated by a little not unnatural carelessness.The rule of\nthe company was specific that all the wagons of every goods train\nshould be out of the way and the track clear at least ten minutes\nbefore a passenger train was due; but in this case shunting was\ngoing actively on when the Irish-mail was within a mile and a half.A careless brakeman then forgot for once that he was leaving his\nwagons close to the head of an incline; a blow in coupling, a little\nheavier perhaps than usual, sufficed to set them in motion; and they\nhappened to be loaded with oil.A catastrophe strikingly similar to that at Abergele befell an\nexpress train on the Hudson River railroad, upon the night of the\n6th of February, 1871.The weather for a number of days preceding\nthe accident had been unusually cold, and it is to the suffering\nof employ\u00e9s incident to exposure, and the consequent neglect of\nprecautions on their part, that accidents are peculiarly due.On\nthis night a freight train was going south, all those in charge of\nwhich were sheltering themselves during a steady run in the caboose\ncar at its rear end.Suddenly, when near a bridge over Wappinger's\nCreek, not far from New Hamburg, they discovered that a car in the\ncentre of the train was off the track.The train was finally stopped\non the bridge, but in stopping it other cars were also derailed,\nand one of these, bearing on it two large oil tanks, finally rested\nobliquely across the bridge with one end projecting over the up\ntrack.Hardly had the disabled train been brought to a stand-still,\nwhen, before signal lanterns could in the confusion incident to the\ndisaster be sent out, the Pacific express from New York, which was\na little behind its time, came rapidly along.As it approached the\nbridge, its engineer saw a red lantern swung, and instantly gave the\nsignal to apply the brakes.It was too late to avoid the collision;\nbut what ensued had in it, so far as the engineer was concerned,\nan element of the heroic, which his companion, the fireman of the\nengine, afterwards described on the witness stand with a directness\nand simplicity of language which exceeded all art.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.The engineer's\nname was Simmons, and he was familiarly known among his companions\nas \"Doc.\"His fireman, Nicholas Tallon, also saw the red light swung\non the bridge, and called out to him that the draw was open.In\nreply Simmons told him to spring the patent brake, which he did,\nand by this time they were alongside of the locomotive of the\ndisabled train and running with a somewhat slackened speed.Tallon\nhad now got out upon the step of the locomotive, preparatory to\nspringing off, and turning asked his companion if he also proposed\nto do the same:--\"'Doc' looked around at me but made no reply, and\nthen looked ahead again, watching his business; then I jumped and\nrolled down on the ice in the creek; the next I knew I heard the\ncrash and saw the fire and smoke.\"The next seen of \"Doc\" Simmons,\nhe was dragged up days afterwards from under his locomotive at the\nbottom of the river.He went out\nof the world and of the sight of men with his hand on the lever,\nmaking no reply to the suggestion that he should leave his post, but\n\"looking ahead and watching his business.\"Dante himself could not have imagined a greater complication of\nhorrors than then ensued: liquid fire and solid frost combined to\nmake the work of destruction perfect.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the apple there.The shock of the collision\nbroke in pieces the oil car, igniting its contents and flinging them\nabout in every direction.In an instant bridge, river, locomotive,\ncars, and the glittering surface of the ice were wrapped in a sheet\nof flame.At the same time the strain proved too severe for the\ntrestlework, which gave way, precipitating the locomotive, tender,\nbaggage cars, and one passenger car onto the ice, through which they\ninstantly crushed and sank deep out of sight beneath the water.Of the remaining seven cars of the passenger train, two, besides\nseveral of the freight train, were destroyed by fire, and shortly,\nas the supports of the remaining portions of the bridge burned away,\nthe superstructure fell on the half-submerged cars in the water and\nburied them from view.Twenty-one persons lost their lives in this disaster, and a large\nnumber of others were injured; but the loss of life, it will be\nnoticed, was only two-thirds of that at Abergele.The New Hamburg\ncatastrophe also differed from that at Abergele in that, under\nits particular circumstances, it was far more preventable, and,\nindeed, with the appliances since brought into use it would surely\nbe avoided.The modern train-brake had, however, not then been\nperfected, so that even the hundred rods at which the signal was\nseen did not afford a sufficient space in which to stop the train.It is difficult to see how on double track roads, where the\noccurrence of an accident on one line of tracks is always liable to\ninstantly \"foul\" the other line, it is possible to guard against\ncontingencies like that which occurred at New Hamburg.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.At the time,\nas is usual in such cases, the public indignation expended itself\nin vague denunciation of the Hudson River Railroad Company, because\nthe disaster happened to take place upon a bridge in which there was\na draw to permit the passage of vessels.There seemed to be a vague\nbut very general impression that draw-bridges were dangerous things,\nand, because other accidents due to different causes had happened\nupon them, that the occurrence of this accident, from whatever\ncause, was in itself sufficient evidence of gross carelessness.The\nfact was that not even the clumsy Connecticut rule, which compels\nthe stopping of all trains before entering on any draw-bridge,\nwould have sufficed to avert the New Hamburg disaster, for the\nriver was then frozen and the draw was not in use, so that for the\ntime being the bridge was an ordinary bridge; and not even in the\nfrenzy of crude suggestions which invariably succeeds each new\naccident was any one ever found ignorant enough to suggest the\nstopping of all trains before entering upon every bridge, which, as\nrailroads generally follow water-courses, would not infrequently\nnecessitate an average of one stop to every thousand feet or so.Only incidentally did the bridge at New Hamburg have anything to\ndo with the disaster there, the essence of which lay in the sudden\nderailment of an oil car immediately in front of a passenger train\nrunning in the opposite direction and on the other track.Of course,\nif the derailment had occurred long enough before the passenger\ntrain came up to allow the proper signals to be given, and this\nprecaution had been neglected, then the disaster would have been\ndue, not to the original cause, but to the defective discipline\nof the employ\u00e9s.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.Such does not appear to have been the case at\nNew Hamburg, nor was that disaster by any means the first due to\nderailment and the throwing of cars from one track in front of a\ntrain passing upon the other;--nor will it be the last.Indeed, an\naccident hardly less destructive, arising from that very cause, had\noccurred only eight months previous in England, and resulted in\neighteen deaths and more than fifty cases of injury.A goods train made up of a locomotive and twenty-nine wagons was\nrunning at a speed of some twenty miles an hour on the Great\nNorthern road, between Newark and Claypole, about one hundred miles\nfrom London, when the forward axle under one of the wagons broke.As\na result of the derailment which ensued the train became divided,\nand presently the disabled car was driven by the pressure behind it\nout of its course and over the interval, so that it finally rested\npartly across the other track.At just this moment an excursion\ntrain from London, made up of twenty-three carriages and containing\nsome three hundred and forty passengers, came along at a speed of\nabout thirty-five miles an hour.It was quite dark, and the engineer\nof the freight train waved his arm as a signal of danger; one of\nthe guards, also, showed a red light with his hand lantern, but his\naction either was not seen or was misunderstood, for without any\nreduction of speed being made the engine of the excursion train\nplunged headlong into the disabled goods wagon.The collision was\nso violent as to turn the engine aside off the track and cause it\nto strike the stone pier of a bridge near by, by which it was flung\ncompletely around and then driven up the <DW72> of the cutting, where\nit toppled over like a rearing horse and fell back into the roadway.The tender likewise was overturned; but not so the carriages.They\nrushed along holding to the track, and the side of each as it passed\nwas ripped and torn by the projecting end of the goods wagon.Of the twenty-three carriages and vans in the train scarcely one\nescaped damage, while the more forward ones were in several cases\nlifted one on top of the other or forced partly up the <DW72> of\nthe cutting, whence they fell back again, crushing the passengers\nbeneath them.This accident occurred on the 21st of June, 1870; it was very\nthoroughly investigated by Captain Tyler on behalf of the Board of\nTrade, with the apparent conclusion that it was one which could\nhardly have been guarded against.The freight cars, the broken\naxle of which occasioned the disaster, did not belong to the Great\nNorthern company, and the wheels of the train had been properly\nexamined by viewing and tapping at the several stopping-places; the\nflaw which led to the fracture was, however, of such a nature that\nit could have been detected only by the removal of the wheel.It did\nnot appear that the employ\u00e9s of the company had been guilty of any\nnegligence; and it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the\naccident was due to one of those defects to which the results of\neven the most perfect human workmanship must ever remain liable, and\nthis had revealed itself under exactly those conditions which must\ninvolve the most disastrous consequences.The English accident did, however, establish one thing, if nothing\nelse; it showed the immeasurable superiority of the system of\ninvestigation pursued in the case of railroad accidents in England\nover that pursued in this country.There a trained expert after\nthe occurrence of each disaster visits the spot and sifts the\naffair to the very bottom, locating responsibility and pointing out\ndistinctly the measures necessary to guard against its repetition.Here the case ordinarily goes to a coroner's jury, the findings of\nwhich as a rule admirably sustain the ancient reputation of that\naugust tribunal.It is absolutely sad to follow the course of these\ninvestigations, they are conducted with such an entire disregard of\nmethod and lead to such inadequate conclusions.Indeed, how could it\nbe otherwise?--The same man never investigates two accidents, and,\nfor the one investigation he does make, he is competent only in his\nown esteem.Take the New Hamburgh accident as an example.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the apple there.Rarely has any\ncatastrophe merited a more careful investigation, and few\nindeed have ever called forth more ill-considered criticism or\ncrude suggestions.Almost nothing of interest respecting it was\nelicited at the inquest, and now no reliable criticism can be\nventured upon it.The question of responsibility in that case,\nand of prevention thereafter, involved careful inquiry into at\nleast four subjects:--First, the ownership and condition of the\nfreight car, the fractured axle of which occasioned the disaster,\ntogether with the precautions taken by the company, usually and in\nthis particular case, to test the wheels of freight cars moving\nover its road, especially during times of severe cold.--Second,\nthe conduct of those in charge of the freight train immediately\npreceding and at the time of the accident; was the fracture of the\naxle at once noticed and were measures taken to stop the train, or\nwas the derailment aggravated by neglect into the form it finally\ntook?--Third, was there any neglect in signaling the accident on\nthe part of those in charge of the disabled train, and how much\ntime elapsed between the accident and the collision?--Fourth, what,\nif any, improved appliances would have enabled those in charge\nof either train to have averted the accident?--and what, if any,\ndefects either in the rules or the equipment in use were revealed?No satisfactory conclusion can now be arrived at upon any of these\npoints, though the probabilities are that with the appliances since\nintroduced the train might have been stopped in time.In this case,\nas in that at Clay", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "There is a strong probability that the investigation\nwent off, so to speak, on a wholly false issue,--turned on the\ndraw-bridge frenzy instead of upon the question of care.So far\nas the verdict declared that the disaster was due to a collision\nbetween a passenger train and a derailed oil car, and not to the\nexistence of a draw in the bridge on which it happened to occur, it\nwas, indeed, entitled to respect, and yet it was on this very point\nthat it excited the most criticism.Loud commendation was heard\nthrough the press of the Connecticut law, which had been in force\nfor twenty years, and, indeed, still is in force there, under which\nall trains are compelled to come to a full stop before entering\non any bridge which has a draw in it,--a law which may best be\ndescribed as a useless nuisance.Yet the grand jury of the Court of\nOyer and Terminer of New York city even went so far as to recommend,\nin a report made by it on the 23d of February, 1871,--sixteen days\nafter the accident,--the passage by the legislature then in session\nat Albany of a similar legal absurdity.Fortunately better counsels\nprevailed, and, as the public recovered its equilibrium, the matter\nwas allowed to drop.The Connecticut law in question, however, originated in an accident\nwhich at the time had startled and shocked the community as much\neven as that at Versailles did before or that at Abergele has since\ndone.It occurred to an express train on the New York & New Haven\nroad at Norwalk, in Connecticut, on the 6th of May, 1853.CHAPTER X.\n\nTHE NORWALK ACCIDENT.The railroad at Norwalk crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound\nby means of a draw-bridge, which is approached from the direction\nof New York around a sharp curve.A ball at the mast-head was in\n1853 the signal that the draw was open and the bridge closed to\nthe passage of trains.The express passenger train for Boston,\nconsisting of a locomotive and two baggage and five passenger cars,\ncontaining about one hundred and fifty persons, left New York as\nusual at eight o'clock that morning.The locomotive was not in\ncharge of its usual engine-driver but of a substitute named Tucker;\na man who some seven years before had been injured in a previous\ncollision on the same road, for which he did not appear to have\nbeen in any way responsible, but who had then given up his position\nand gone to California, whence he had recently returned and was now\nagain an applicant for an engineer's situation.This was his third\ntrip over the road, as substitute.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.In approaching the bridge at\nNorwalk he apparently wholly neglected to look for the draw-signal.He was running his train at about the usual rate of speed, and\nfirst became aware that the draw was open when within four hundred\nfeet of it and after it had become wholly impossible to stop the\ntrain in time.He immediately whistled for brakes and reversed his\nengine, and then, without setting the brake on his tender, both he\nand the fireman sprang off and escaped with trifling injuries.The\ntrain at this time did not appear to be moving at a speed of over\nfifteen miles an hour.The draw was sixty feet in width; the water\nin the then state of the tide was about twelve feet deep, and the\nsame distance below the level of the bridge.Although the speed\nof the train had been materially reduced, yet when it came to the\nopening it was still moving with sufficient impetus to send its\nlocomotive clean across the sixty foot interval and to cause it to\nstrike the opposite abutment about eight feet below the track; it\nthen fell heavily to the bottom.The tender lodged on top of the\nlocomotive, bottom up and resting against the pier, while on top\nof this again was the first baggage car.The second baggage car,\nwhich contained also a compartment for smokers, followed, but in\nfalling was canted over to the north side of the draw in such a way\nas not to be wholly submerged, so that most of those in it were\nsaved.The first passenger car next plunged into the opening; its\nforward end crushed in, as it fell against the baggage car in front\nof it, while its rear end dropped into the deep water below; and\non top of it came the second passenger car, burying the passengers\nin the first beneath the _d\u00e9bris_, and itself partially submerged.The succeeding or third passenger car, instead of following the\nothers, broke in two in the middle, the forward part hanging down\nover the edge of the draw, while the rear of it rested on the track\nand stayed the course of the remainder of the train.Including those\nin the smoking compartment more than a hundred persons were plunged\ninto the channel, of whom forty-six lost their lives, while some\nthirty others were more or less severely injured.The killed were\nmainly among the passengers in the first car; for, in falling, the\nroof of the second car was split open, and it finally rested in such\na position that, as no succeeding car came on top of it, many of\nthose in it were enabled to extricate themselves; indeed, more than\none of the passengers in falling were absolutely thrown through the\naperture in the roof, and, without any volition on their part, were\nsaved with unmoistened garments.Shocking as this catastrophe was, it was eclipsed in horror by\nanother exactly similar in character, though from the peculiar\ncircumstances of the case it excited far less public notice, which\noccurred eleven years later on the Grand Trunk railway of Canada.In this case a large party of emigrants, over 500 in number and\nchiefly Poles, Germans and Norwegians of the better class, had\nlanded at Quebec and were being forwarded on a special train to\ntheir destination in the West.With their baggage they filled\nthirteen cars.The Grand Trunk on the way to Montreal crosses the\nRichelieu river at Beloeil by an iron bridge, in the westernmost\nspan of which was a draw over the canal, some 45 feet below it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.Both\nby law and under the running rules of the road all trains were to\ncome to a dead stand on approaching the bridge, and to proceed only\nwhen the safety signal was clearly discerned.This rule, however,\nas it appeared at the subsequent inquest, had been systematically\ndisobeyed, it having been considered sufficient if the train was\n\"slowed down.\"In the present case, however--the night of June 29,\n1864,--though the danger signal was displayed and in full sight\nfor a distance of 1,600 feet, the engine-driver, unfamiliar with\nthe road and its signals, failed to see it, and, without slowing\nhis train even, ran directly onto the bridge.He became aware of\nthe danger when too late to stop.The draw was open to permit the\npassage of a steamer with six barges in tow, one of which was\ndirectly under the opening.The whole train went through the draw,\nsinking the barge and piling itself up in the water on top of it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.The three last cars, falling on the accumulated wreck, toppled over\nupon the west embankment and were thus less injured than the others.The details of the accident were singularly distressing.\"As soon\nas possible a strong cable was attached to the upper part of the\npiling, and by this means two cars, the last of the ill-fated train,\nwere dragged onto the wharf under the bridge.A shapeless blue mass of hands and heads and feet\nprotruded among the splinters and frame-work, and gradually resolved\nitself into a closely-packed mass of human beings, all ragged and\nbloody and dinted from crown to foot with blue bruises and weals\nand cuts inflicted by the ponderous iron work, the splinters and\nthe enormous weight of the train.* * * A great many of the dead\nhad evidently been asleep; the majority of them had taken off their\nboots and coats in the endeavor to make themselves as comfortable\nas possible.They lay heaped upon one another like sacks, dressed\nin the traditional blue clothing of the German people.* * * A\nchild was got at and removed nine hours after the accident, being\nuninjured in its dead mother's arms.\"The accident happened at 2 A.M., and before sundown of the next day\n86 bodies had been taken out of the canal; others were subsequently\nrecovered, and yet more died from their hurts.It was altogether a disaster of the most\nappalling description, in extenuation of which nothing was to\nbe said.It befell, however, a body of comparatively friendless\nemigrants, and excited not a tithe of the painful interest which yet\nattaches to the similar accident to the Boston express at Norwalk.These terrible disasters were both due, not alone to the\ncarelessness of the two engine-drivers, but to the use of a crude\nand inadequate system of signals.It so happened, however, that\nthe legislature of Connecticut was unfortunately in session at the\ntime of the Norwalk disaster, and consequently the public panic\nand indignation took shape in a law compelling every train on\nthe railroads of that state to come to a dead stand-still before\nentering upon any bridge in which there was a draw.This law is\nstill in force, and from time to time, as after the New Hamburg\ncatastrophe, an unreasoning clamor is raised for it in other\nstates.In point of fact it imposes a most absurd, unnecessary and\nannoying delay on travel, and rests upon the Connecticut statute\nbook a curious illustration of what usually happens when legislators\nundertake to incorporate running railroad regulations into the\nstatutes-at-large.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.They are being beaten with whips of their\nown choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with\nscorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,\nsemi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and\nuphold it.Let them drudge and let\nthem starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded\nstreets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.The shops\nwere all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,\nand the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with\nsightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed\nmen and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the\npoulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried\nrows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share\nmany of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly\nat their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the\nwomen, evidently working men's wives.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the apple there.Their faded, ill-fitting\ngarments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn\nfaces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little\nchildren who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and\ndependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the\nwistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of\nthe toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and\nfilled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy\nand all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the\nthings that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they\nwere not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his\nheart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the\nmidst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame\nbecause he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest\ncause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of\nthe disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children\nwere standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some\nof these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro\nbefore the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way\nin which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their\ncages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from\none end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed\nagainst the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each\nother the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a\nlarge strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in\nit and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines\nas well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real\ntunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the\nsignals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to\nlight when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes\nthat you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this\nneedlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung\ntightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and\ndesire.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a\nsigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no\nuse lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have\nsuch good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities\nof life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to\nfollow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not\nlived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were\nnot for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he\npursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a\ngee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort\nhim by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the\nwindows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to\nbring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any\nimpression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at\nonce.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom\nthey hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain\ngifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from\nhim.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'\nsaid Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized\nthe absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's\nhand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered\nElsie.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's\nsure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest\nextent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man\nnow, so old that he can't do all his work himself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.Last year he was so\ntired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to\ngive things to, and consequently a great many of them never got\nanything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's\ngiven me some money and a list of children's names, and against their\nnames are written the toys they are to have.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.My work is to buy the\nthings and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible\nas the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost\ncompel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at\nlength, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an\nawestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of\nhis hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his\npocket-book and turned over the leaves.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.'I've got the list here;\nperhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they\nlistened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,\n'Why, yes, here they are!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can\nbe taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse\nwith real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of\ngroceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with\nreal coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines\nround.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'\nhe continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;\nit will save me a lot of work.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.I shall not have the trouble of taking\nthem round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't\nit?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to\ngasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the\nfour whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in\na half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at\nall.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They\ndid not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and\nhanded it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely\nconscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington\nwas talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the\nsound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one\nparcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,\nwas also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst\nwhen the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,\nwho went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he\nwere walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near\nby, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that\nhe had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a\npair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy\nthese, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of\nholes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure\nSanta Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,\nbut had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54\n\nThe End\n\n\nThe following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he\nwas going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,\nalthough he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share\nof work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they\noften had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that\nthe slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,\nwhich made it almost impossible to work even when he had the\nopportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will\nthat he was able to continue working at all.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the milk.He contrived to keep up\nappearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew\nthat Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook\nit so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very\nuseful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with\nwhom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a\nmate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two\nmen's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it\nmakes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in\nthe winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local\nhospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid\nthey were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in\nthe town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the\nhospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they\ngave to anyone who needed and asked for them.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.The employer had to fill\nin the ticket or application form with the name and address of the\napplicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a\ndeserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the\nmajority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to\nthis hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a\nprivate doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a\nparticular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The\nmedicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for\nthe truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of\nothers--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things\nthat had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been\ndying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to\nbuy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but\nalthough some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough\nfor him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of\nbeing unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to\nbelieve that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once\nmore.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in\nthe sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off\nthe ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in\nRushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been\ntalking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not\nwork for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.I just\nwanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the\nmajority.He doesn't approve of my\nopinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding\nthem, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own\nway.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring\nI intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold\nmeetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll\nstart a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up\nfrom the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot\nof boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in\nthe next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door\nbell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing\nthe door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,\nand from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the\nadjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the\nfront door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with\nexcitement, burst into the room, crying out:\n\n'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering\ngleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified\nby this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home\nagain with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for\na Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation\nfrom his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;\nit was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to\nwrite.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then\nshe helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested\nthat the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.He went in here\nand bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed\nthe pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with\nthe two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having\naddressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for\nhim outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I\ndon't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get\nhome.'Barrington hesitated and looked at his watch.'I think I have time to\ngo back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be\nquite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the\nentrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a\nmoment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and\nlooking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you\nwere to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we\ncould wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of\nOwen's flat, and then he hurried away.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football.When he gained the main road he\nheard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the\nside-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious\nmeeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and\non the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not\nmocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they\nhad come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy\nto hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of\nthe Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the\norganizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he\nwas 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there\nco-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,\nRushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd\nas his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in\na new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr\nGrinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged\nworship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk\nhats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they\nhad fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr\nDauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he\nwas paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing\nin his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function\nwas to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of\nrespectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang\nof swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority\nof the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his\npresence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical\nrepresentatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity\nhave made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who\nlooked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily\ndressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of\nplace in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced\nworking men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off\nclothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give\nout the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of\nhis remarks:\n\n\n        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,\n        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of\nthem ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were\nconducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of\nChrist--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not\nthe world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it\nis easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich\nman to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled\n'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal\nbusiness of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and\ngrievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they\nthemselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is\nyour master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all\nthese alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be\nother people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,\nwhilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and\nfared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands\nof those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and\nlittle children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have\nalready seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton\nand the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus\npreached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not\nseem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,\nthat Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to\nforget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do\nnot the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and\ndoeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house\nupon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did\nthe things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and\nsang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to\nexhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And\nthey procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,\nGod is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,\nforgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically\nfalse and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several\nother infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had\naddressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,\nof whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain\npleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as\nRushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:\n\n        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium\nstruck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the\nsinging:\n\n        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the\ncrowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to\nBarrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was\nSlyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by\nname.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:\n\n'I don't", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after\na pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge\nanyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much\nI've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I\nshould 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was\nfinished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a\nhearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing\nweek at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there\nspecially, of course, because it was the place with which he was\nhimself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they\nwould not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places\nof worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly\nevery street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining\nLight could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did\nhope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go\nSomewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for\nthe presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed\ndisciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore\nmore respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each\nother or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two\npoor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with\nthe hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried\noff to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he\nread by the light of a street lamp--\n\n                   Come and join the Brotherhood\n                    at the Shining Light Chapel\n                                PSA\n                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band\n                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a\nplace--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like\nthis.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep\nin her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had\nboth been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton\nand Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of\naccomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their\nown position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said\nNora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her\ntoo.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill\nyou are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said\nOwen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled\nthrough somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make\nmuch difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have\nbeen if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child\nand the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent\na thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,\ndependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he\nwould never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had\nsometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do\nso still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a\nmoment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his\ntrain goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's\nimpetuosity.We don't want the window open\nall that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and\nthat's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past\nunnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the\nglass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while\nOwen opened the letter:\n\n'Dear Owen,\n\n'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the\nother for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself\nin the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you\nif our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you\nwould willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you\nby refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's\nmother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for\nthe fray when I come back in the spring,\n\n                             'Yours for the cause,\n\n                                                  'George Barrington.'<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly\nunderstand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not\nhave spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who\nfelt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted\nfrom her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as\nshe thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the\ndirection of the station.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at\nlast as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass\nas fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's\nnearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said\nOwen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the\nchild up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened\nthe window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it\ndrew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came\ninto sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were\nilluminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;\na few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed\nas it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later\nit thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his\nface, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a\nhandkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in\nreturn.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the\nlights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those\nvanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the\nadjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the\nroad were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'\nadvertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop\nformerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt\ntwo or three months previously, was also plastered with similar\ndecorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the\npremises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were\njust being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were\nclosing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more\ncheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the\nmoon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;\nbut a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the\nweather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being\nconcealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly\naccumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few\nminutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that\nthe gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the\nInfamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting\nfor their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each\nother like wild beasts.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;\nabundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and\ncrime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of\nworking for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and\ncold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time\ntheir grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the\nblack masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,\nseemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist\nSystem.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest\nmeasure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling\ninto ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so\nwicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and\ncurse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for\never, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the\nCo-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of\nbondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain\nprone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving\nasunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from\nthem the face of heaven.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.The light that will shine upon the world wide\nFatherland

miles from London.Looking\nwest, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand\nParade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad\nhills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,\ncultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles\naway.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful\nand sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the\nwealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous\nboarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,\nthe town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the\nother side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working\nclasses lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more\ncostly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of\nlate years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on\nthe Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of\nEngland.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of\nprosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what\nwere called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The\nGrand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and\ncarriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of\nour story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair\noutward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited\nsepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the\nmajority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty\nwhich in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for\nthis was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and\nboarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working\nclasses were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public\nworks and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased\nthe rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services\nundertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every\npublic service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of\nprivate companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the\nhands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the\nCorporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of\ntheir number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of\nwhom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which\nbattened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,\nthe Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous\nothers.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,\nDidlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the\noldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown\nwith the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the\ngreater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although\nthey lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by\nlaw from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently\nfound it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They\npaid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of\ncourse--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and\nluxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of\nBonuses.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the\nprofits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the\nworkmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by\nthe terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of\ncourse none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing\nthat.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about\nthem.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small\namount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy\nthe Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon\nwhom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that\nthe sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but\nit was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally\nconsidered to be impracticable.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough\nhad to buy the gas.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company\nfor the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the\nCouncil.\u201cDuring the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very\nhigh prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same\nspirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal\ncould be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire\nit is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is\nunquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives\nprizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most\nimportant horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the\nbreed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial\nfarmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a\nsimilar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large\nrailway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a\nbinder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West\nTerritory of Canada, and his last letter says, \u2018The only thing in\nthe stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are\nkeeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are\ncoming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough\nfor their own needs\u2019; and it may be mentioned that almost the only\nkind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which\nis certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the\nnative draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING\n\n\u201cThe cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about \u00a311,\nwhich is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire\nhorse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows\nlike Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at\nthe best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least\nsome of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an\nincrease in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.\u201cA few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of\na thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;\nbut the reign of what may be called \u2018fancy\u2019 prices appears to be\nover, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have\ndeclined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the\nrecord average of \u00a3226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general\naverage for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.\u00a3112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the\nhighest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being\n1550 guineas, given by Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre\nChampion, at the late Mr.Other high-priced\nstallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and\nChancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,\n1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases\nof Mr.Victor Cavendish in the year 1897.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.These figures show that the\nworth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and\nit is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is\nby no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males\noffered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there\nis \u2018room on the top\u2019 for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in\nview and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions\nit behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no\nfalling off in the standard of the horses \u2018raised,\u2019 to use the American\nword, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that\nvisitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they\ncome to \u2018the stud farm of the world.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock\nwhich has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly\nemphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British\nmarket being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of\nmales, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which\nbreeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood\nfamous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs\u2019 brothers,\nNorthwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as\nshowing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after\nyear if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of\nmerit.\u201cWith the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply\nof mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring\nsocieties, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade\nsires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,\nand the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other\ncountries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for\nShires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,\nbut from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either\nforming or replenishing studs, therefore, \u2018the almighty dollar\u2019 has not\nbeen responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable\nthat with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western\nCanada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to\nhelp the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be\nuseful for both tillage and haulage purposes.\u201cThe adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well\nknown, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an\naverage of \u00a3223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making \u00a3525.\u201cMeanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British\nbreeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest\nfairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus\nfurther the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the\nexport trade.\u201d\n\nIt may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and\nLord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of\nAmerica for exhibition.CHAPTER XV\n\nPROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS\n\n\nSeeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge\ncups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name\nis mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show\nof 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased\nthe second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by\nLincolnshire Lad II.)Edward Green for 1100 guineas.He is\nremembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short\nlegs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been\nfound at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and\nthird with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan\u2019s Flower by the Champion Vulcan\nand Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.The former won the\nFilly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud\nof Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a\nvery high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,\nwhich won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him\n750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord\nRothschild\u2019s stud.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in\n1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as\nmodels of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in\n1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win\nhighest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through\nLord Rothschild\u2019s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as\na two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.\nWhitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football there.Champion\u2019s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,\nso we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central\nfigure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,\nWoldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the\nTring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire\nHorse Society.At Lord Rothschild\u2019s first sale in 1898, he purchased\nWindley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old\nfilly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.At the\nTandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the\nLockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir\nWalpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King\nblood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at\nthe Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a\nbrilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.\nEwart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at\nPeterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give \u00a34305 for a two-year-old colt\ndeserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD\n\nAt the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased\nDunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,\nfor 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won\nsecond and third for him in London the same month, this being the first\nshow at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by\nMessrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas\ncreated quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so\nfor nearly four years.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is\nMollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is\nLorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased\nprivately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines\nis Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,\nwon first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards\nselling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With\nsuch animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,\nalthough they do not come from the district known to the law makers of\nold as the breeding ground of \u201cthe Great Horse.\u201d\n\n\nTHE PENDLEY FEMALES\n\nOne of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at\nthe shows of the past few seasons has been Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.J. G. Williams, Pendley\nManor, Tring.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the football.Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under\nnotice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.In 1908 Lord\nEgerton\u2019s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having\nbeen first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest\nPrincess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup\nwinner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named.At the\nTring Park sale of 1913 Mr.Williams gave the highest price made by\na female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest\nKing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the football there.She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him.One of the\nlater acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and\nreserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the\nRoyal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Williams joined the\nShire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London\nChampionship with his mares and fillies.A NEW STUD\n\nAfter Champion\u2019s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr.Beck announced that\nthe disappointed bidder was Mr.C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the\nEdgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission\nto the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,\n1913.Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and\nhalf brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown\nin London just after, where he won fourth prize.From this single entry\nin 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries\nwere made at the 1914 London Show.Fine Feathers was the first prize\nyearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,\nthe own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.After the show Lord Rothschild\u2019s first prize two-year colt, Orfold\nBlue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize\nyearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill\nForest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,\nLtd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.In future Edgcote\npromises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its\nShorthorns.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.DUCAL STUDS\n\nA very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace\nthe Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton\nNunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.Shires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the\nstud contains many promising animals now.Mention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke\nof Devonshire who, as the Hon.Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class\nstud at Holker, Lancs.At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker\nMars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the\nNorwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912\nfor his popular owner.OTHER STUDS\n\nAmong those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old\nEnglish type of cart-horse, the name of Mr.Clement Keevil deserves\na foremost place.At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of\nstud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for\nmassive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree\nwhich traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the\nyear 1769, to Wiseman\u2019s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire\nweighing 1 ton 8 cwt.Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where\nseveral sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.Everard gave\n860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon.Shortly before that he\nsold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.The prefix \u201cBirdsall\u201d has been seen in show catalogues for a number of\nyears, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by\nLord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen\nto found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the\nShire Horse Society.As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two\nentries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton\u2019s own sire, Northwood, to which\nreference is made elsewhere.Another notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in\nLondon, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall\nMenestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild\nas a yearling.As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve\nChampion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner.A good bidder at\nShire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of\nthe Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion\nhonours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.Another stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.A. Grandage, has\nnow been removed to Cheshire.Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,\nhis first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in\n1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of\nLincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr.Edward Green for 825\nguineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr.Grandage,\nseeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two\nfollowing years, 1910 and 1911.Candidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are\nlikely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.Among those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,\nHighfield, Leek, Staffs.His first London success was third prize with\nRokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he\nhas taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and\nhas the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced\nmare yet sold by auction.At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second\nhighest price of that day,", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "Another bad loss to Sir Arthur\nand to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,\nseeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest\nKing, for begetting show animals.Among the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be\nmentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,\nfirst as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by\nRedlynch Forest King.With such as these coming on there is a future\nbefore the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame\nachieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz.F. E. Muntz,\nof Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore\nBaronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.Quite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for\nthe best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914.The winner,\nDanesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on\nboth occasions, and this typical \u201cOld English Black\u201d had a host of\nadmirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his\nparade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.It used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but\nMr.Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove\notherwise.Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered\nquite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of\nhigh-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,\nand a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge\n(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.Salomons at the Tandridge\ndispersion sale for 1600 guineas.At the sale during the London Show of\n1914 Mr.Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury\nCoronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his\nclass, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,\nby the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both\nbeing three years old.This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,\nno matter where its situation.Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who\nhas been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.He purchased\nDanesfield Stonewall from Mr.R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes\nbefore re-selling him to Mr.His stud horses now includes\nMarathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910.Mares and\nfillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and\nother meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.A fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,\nGarstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,\nKing\u2019s Choice, was bred by Messrs.J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won\nfirst with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.John Ferneyhough\ntook first prize as a three-year-old.With stallions of his type and\nmares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion\u2019s Choice (by Childwick\nChampion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these\nLancashire breeders.The Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late\nMr.James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908.His business abilities\nand keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged\nin London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.This being a\nrecord in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great\nShow of the breed.Carlton has always been famous for its stallions.It has furnished\nLondon winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom\n(1902 and 1903), Present King II.(1906), and Stolen Duchess, the\nChallenge Cup winning mare of 1907.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.Forshaw and his sons are too numerous\nto mention in detail.Another very\nimpressive stallion was What\u2019s Wanted, the sire of Mr.A. C. Duncombe\u2019s\nPremier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of\ncelebrated sons.His great grandsire was (Dack\u2019s) Matchless 1509, a\ngreat sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate\nfor thirteen consecutive seasons.Forshaw\u2019s opinion\nof him is given on another page.One of the most successful Carlton\nsires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray\nKing, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when\nsold.Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud\nthrough several decades of last century, and that a large number have\nbeen travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has\nbeen done by Messrs.Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the\ninfluence of this stud has been world-wide.It is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book\nlike this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that\nthey are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,\ntherefore they have \u201ckept the ball rolling,\u201d viz.Thomas\nEwart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud\nof the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was\ndispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of\nwhich is Dunsmore Chessie.R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires\nof Mr.R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at\nDanesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking\nover the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire\nbreeding quite successfully on his own account.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.The other of this class to be named is Mr.C. E. McKenna, who took over\nthe Bardon stud from Mr.B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let\nthe Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last\nand worthiest years.Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate\nmeans faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither\nlandowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be\nmentioned Mr.James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon\nMenestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at\nthe 1914 London Show; Messrs.E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,\nwho won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards\nselling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree\nwith him two years later.Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the\nexhibitors\u2019 list at the London Show of 1899.Perhaps his most notable\nhorse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth\nprize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs.Potter\u2019s King\u2019s Choice\nabove mentioned.Many other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and\nspace permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his\nbest colts \u201cSign of Riches,\u201d which must be regarded as an advertisement\nfor the breed from a farmer\u2019s point of view.Of past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter\nGilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915.The first\nShire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the\nlate Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by\nSpark, the average of \u00a3172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby\nsale of 1891 (which was \u00a3198 17_s._ 3_d._).Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse\nSociety; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by\npresenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering\n1250.The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)\nat the London Show of 1891.CHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\n\nThis book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the\nabsorbing topic.In fact, no other will be listened to.What is\nthe good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of\nagriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence?To a\ncertain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more\nparticularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three\nseasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses\ncoming along for future use.The cry of the army authorities is for \u201cmore and more men,\u201d together\nwith a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including\nthe weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no\nprovision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the\nguns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and\nmost others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.The motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals\nwho have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered\nmountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable\nfor mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or\ndrawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.When the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,\nhorse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before.But horses,\nparticularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use.So far, coal\nmerchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry\nusers have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.For taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy\nhorses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they\nhave ever been.The railways will continue to exist, and, while they\ndo, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the\nnecessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.During the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got\nplenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,\n\u201cgrow more wheat.\u201d\n\nIf this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at\nleast to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,\nthat more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat.The land\nhas to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home\nand delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.It may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam\nwaggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.Moreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or\nstanding idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare\ndoes not do.If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value\nfrom the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years\nold, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make\nroom for younger animals.Horse power is therefore the cheapest and\nmost satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field\nimplements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of\nthe Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.When awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--\n\n\u201cGeneral Management with a view to profit,\u201d so that any breed of live\nstock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.Only a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord\nthat Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the\nrent audit, \u201cwith a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.\u201d\n\nMost landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,\ntherefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have\ndone during the past twenty-five years.Wars come to an end--the \u201cThirty Years\u2019 War\u201d did--so let us remember\nthe Divine promise to Noah after the flood, \u201cWhile the earth remaineth\nseedtime and harvest \u2026 shall not cease,\u201d Gen.As long as there is\nsowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.\u201cFar back in the ages\n      The plough with wreaths was crowned;\n    The hands of kings and sages\n      Entwined the chaplet round;\n    Till men of spoil disdained the toil\n      By which the world was nourished,\n    And dews of blood enriched the soil\n      Where green their laurels flourished:\n    Now the world her fault repairs--\n      The guilt that stains her story;\n    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares\n      That formed her earliest glory.The glory, earned in deadly fray,\n      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o\u2019er all the Earth\n      Through endless generations,\n    The art that calls her harvests forth\n      And feeds the expectant nations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\n\n    A\n\n    Alston Rose, champion mare 1901 \u2026 104\n\n    Armour-clad warriors, 1, 7\n\n    Army horses, 6\n\n    Ashbourne Foal Show, 80\n\n    Attention to feet, 42\n\n    Aurea, champion mare, 18, 65\n\n    Author\u2019s Preface, v\n\n    Average prices, 76\n\n\n    B\n\n    Back breeding, value of, 11, 13, 39\n\n    Bakewell, Robert, 2, 22, 54\n\n    Bardon Extraordinary, champion gelding, 65, 78\n\n    Bardon Stud, 118\n\n    Bar None, 80\n\n    Bearwardcote Blaze, 60\n\n    Bedding, 35\n\n    Birdsall Menestrel, 84, 111\n\n    ---- stud, 110\n\n    Black horses, Bakewell\u2019s, 55\n\n    Black horses from Flanders, 58\n\n    Blagdon Stud, 110\n\n    Blending Shire and Clydesdale breeds, 59\n\n    Boiled barley, 36\n\n    Bradley, Mr.John, 83\n\n    Bramhope stud, 111\n\n    Breeders, farmer, 27\n\n    Breeders, prizes for, 65\n\n    Breeding from fillies, 17\n\n    Breeding, time for, 31\n\n    Bury Victor Chief, champion in 1892 \u2026 68, 69\n\n    Buscot Harold, champion stallion, 17, 65\n\n\n    C\n\n    Calwich Stud, 61, 80\n\n    Canada, 101\n\n    Carbonite, 103\n\n    Care of the feet, 42\n\n    Carlton Stud, 116\n\n    Cart-colts, 23\n\n    Cart-horses, 54\n\n    Castrating colts, 39\n\n    Certificate of Soundness, 62\n\n    Champion\u2019s Goalkeeper, champion in 1913 and 1914 \u2026 67, 104\n\n    Champions bred at Sandringham, 3\n\n    Cheap sires, 12\n\n    Clark, Mr.A.

perfectly crammed with Indians and scalps and awful\nbattles and elegant Mexican palaces full of diamonds and gold saucepans\nand lovely Spanish girls carried off by the hair of their heads!\"This flourishing rigmarole, which Harry delivered regardless of stops,\nmade the boys shout with laughter.\"You'd better tell the story yourself, since you know so much about\nit!\"\"I allow you've never been in Mexico, sir,\" said Jerry, grinning.\"I\ndoubt but thar's palisses somewhar in Mexico, but I and my mates hev\nbeen thar, an' _we_ never seed none o' 'em.No, Master Harry, I can't\ntell ye sich stories as that, but I do mind a thing what happened on the\nfield afore Monterey.\"The boys, delightedly exclaiming, \"A story!drew their\ncamp stools around him; and Jerry, after slowly rubbing his hand round\nand round over his bristling chin, while he considered what to say\nfirst, began his story as follows:\n\n\nJERRY'S STORY.\"It wor a Sunday night, young genl'men, the 21st\n          of September, and powerful hot.We had been\n          fightin' like mad, wi' not a moment's rest, all\n          day, an' now at last wor under the canwas, they of\n          us as wor left alive, a tryin' to sleep.The\n          skeeters buzzed aroun' wonderful thick, and the\n          groun' aneath our feet wor like red-hot tin\n          plates, wi' the sun burnin' an blisterin' down.At\n          last my mate Bill says, says he, 'Jerry, my mate,\n          hang me ef I can stan' this any longer.Let you\n          an' me get up an' see ef it be cooler\n          out-o'-doors.'\"I wor tired enough wi' the day's fight, an'\n          worrited, too, wi' a wound in my shoulder; but\n          the tent wor no better nor the open field, an' we\n          got up an' went out.Thar wor no moon, but the sky\n          was wonderful full o' stars, so we could see how\n          we wor stannin' wi' our feet among the bodies o'\n          the poor fellows as had fired their last shot that\n          day.It wor a sight, young genl'men, what would\n          make sich as you sick an' faint to look on; but\n          sogers must larn not to min' it; an' we stood\n          thar, not thinkin' how awful it wor, and yet still\n          an' quiet, too.\"'Ah, Jerry,' says Bill--he wor a young lad, an'\n          brought up by a pious mother, I allow--'I dunnot\n          like this fightin' on the Sabba' day.The Lord\n          will not bless our arms, I'm afeard, if we go agin\n          His will so.'\"I laughed--more shame to me--an' said, 'I'm a\n          sight older nor you, mate, an' I've seed a sight\n          o' wictories got on a Sunday.The better the day,\n          the better the deed, I reckon.'\"'Well, I don't know,' he says;'mebbe things is\n          allers mixed in time o' war, an' right an' wrong\n          change sides a' purpose to suit them as wants\n          battle an' tumult to be ragin'; but it don't go\n          wi' my grain, noways.'\"I hadn't experienced a change o' heart then, as I\n          did arterward, bless the Lord!an' I hardly\n          unnerstood what he said.While we wor a stannin'\n          there, all to onct too dark figgers kim a creepin'\n          over the field to'ard the Major's tent.'Look\n          thar, Jerry,' whispered Bill, kind o' startin'\n          like, 'thar's some of them r", "question": "Where is the milk?

telling him it wor bad fur\n          his wownd to be so res'less (fur every time he\n          tossed, thar kim a little leap o' blood from his\n          breast); an' at last, about foore o'clock in the\n          day, he opened his eyes quite sensible like, an'\n          says to me, he says, 'Dear matey, is that you?Thank you fur coming to see me afore I die.'\"'No, Bill, don't talk so,' I says, a strivin' to\n          be cheerful like, tho' I seed death in his face,\n          'You'll be well afore long.'\"'Aye, well in heaven,' he says; and then, arter a\n          minnit, 'Jerry,' he says, 'thar's a little bounty\n          money as belongs to me in my knapsack, an' my\n          month's wages.I want you, wen I am gone, to take\n          it to my mother, an' tell her--'(he wor gaspin'\n          fearful)--'as I died--fightin' fur my country--an'\n          the flag.God bless you, Jerry--you hev been a\n          good frien' to me, an' I knows as you'll do\n          this--an' bid the boys good-by--fur me.'\"I promised, wi' the tears streamin' down my\n          cheeks; an' then we wor quiet a bit, fur it hurt\n          Bill's breast to talk, an' I could not say a wured\n          fur the choke in my throat.Arter a while he says,\n          'Jerry, won't you sing me the hymn as I taught you\n          aboard the transport?\"I could hardly find v'ice to begin, but it wor\n          Bill's dying wish, an' I made shift to sing as\n          well as I could--\n\n          \"'We air marchin' on together\n              To our etarnal rest;\n           Niver askin' why we're ordered--\n             For the Lord He knoweth best.is His word;\n           Ranks all steady, muskets ready,\n             In the army o' the Lord!\"'Satan's hosts are all aroun' us,\n             An' strive to enter in;\n           But our outworks they are stronger\n             Nor the dark brigades o' sin!Righteousness our sword;\n           Truth the standard--in the vanguard--\n             O' the army o' the Lord!\"'Comrads, we air ever fightin'\n             A battle fur the right;\n           Ever on the on'ard movement\n             Fur our home o' peace an' light.Heaven our reward,\n          Comin' nearer, shinin' clearer--\n             In the army o' the Lord!'\"Arter I hed sung the hymn--an' it wor all I could\n          do to get through--Bill seemed to be a sight\n          easier.He lay still, smilin' like a child on the\n          mother's breast.Pretty soon arter, the Major kim\n          in;

an', his v'ice all hoarse an' full\n          o' death, an' his arm in the air, he shouted,\n          'Aye!we'll fight fur it\n          till--' an' then we hearn a sort o' snap, an' he\n          fell forred--dead!\"We buried him that night, I an' my mates.I cut\n          off a lock o' his hair fur his poor mother, afore\n          we put the airth over him;

but Lord willing I shel go\n          next, to win the Salwation as I've fitten for, by\n          Bill's side, a sojer in Christ's army, in the\n          Etarnal Jerusalem!\"The boys took a long breath when Jerry had finished his story, and more\nthan one bright eye was filled with tears.The rough words, and plain,\nunpolished manner of the old soldier, only heightened the impression\nmade by his story; and as he rose to go away, evidently much moved by\nthe painful recollections it excited, there was a hearty, \"Thank you,\nsergeant, for your story--it was real good!\"Jerry only touched his cap\nto the young soldiers, and marched off hastily, while the boys looked\nafter him in respectful silence.But young spirits soon recover from\ngloomy influences, and in a few moments they were all chattering merrily\nagain.cried Louie; \"I wish we could camp\nout forever!Oh, Freddy, do write a letter to General McClellan, and ask\nhim to let us join the army right away!Tell him we'll buy some new\nindia-rubber back-bones and stretch ourselves out big directly, if he'll\nonly send right on for us!\"\"Perhaps he would, if he knew how jolly we can drill already!\"\"I tell you what, boys, the very thing!let's have a\nreview before we go home.I'll ask all the boys and girls I know to come\nand look on, and we might have quite a grand entertainment.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and\neverything!\"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?\"\"Why--I don't know,\" said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the\nsubject.\"Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean\nto ask my father right away.\"Finally it was\nconcluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,\nif the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for\ntheir swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the\nbattalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all\nthe time, in utter defiance of that \"article of war\" which forbids\n\"talking in the ranks.\"Just as they were passing the lake, they heard\ncarriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on\nthe other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the\nastonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about\nFreddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome\nbarouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, \"what in the world is all\nthis?\"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, \"why, these are the\nDashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie,\" to the little girl on the front seat, who\nwas looking on with deep interest.\"Oh, to be sure, I remember,\" said Miss Carlton, laughing; \"come,\nintroduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!\"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took\nplace.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and\nconfident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little\nJessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated\ncourt martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of\nthe grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with\nhis handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only\nthose poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered\naway with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise\nthat she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the\nunited petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know\nof Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed\nthem to come up to the house \"anyhow.\"The carriage was accordingly\ntaken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the\nZouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young\nladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the\nhorses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of\nthe coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn\nround and talk, didn't know \"where to have them,\" as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and\nfound Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet\nthem, with the cordial greeting of an old friend.\"Well, old bachelor,\" said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies\nascended the steps, \"you see we have come to visit you in state, with\nthe military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four\nbrothers on the Potomac.\"Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'\" said Mr.\"Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be\nleft.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,\nmademoiselle?\"\"Really, I beg their pardons,\" exclaimed Miss Carlton.\"They have come\non a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us\ninterrupt business.\"Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,\na little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the\nfollowing brief oration: \"Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys\nwant--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask\nour friends to look on.Schermerhorn,\nsmiling; \"but what will become of you good people when I tell you that\nI have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join\nher this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me.\"interrupted Peter; \"can't you tell ma\nI've joined the army for the war?\"No, the army\nmust give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just\nhave the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but\nas the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I\nhad intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only\nthing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy\nend being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a\nfellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to\nkeep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to\nchoke him on from morning till night?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the apple there.as Tom indignantly remarked to\nGeorge and Will the same evening.\"The fact is, this sort of thing is\n_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!\"an opinion in which the other _men_\nfully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a\nfew moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided\nto accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a\nbright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in\napple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special\ncharge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only\na soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque\ngroup--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the\nladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite\nreminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in\nwhich George alone quite came up to the regulation \"63 inches.\"Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,\nwho would have given their brightest buttons, every \"man\" of them, to be\nthe most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery\nand the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful\nfashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the\ntents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked\nin); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is\nthe greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy\nmade her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous \"glass agates;\"\none of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other\npatriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter\nclimbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a\nbough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with \"ox hearts;\" Harry\neagerly offered to make any number of \"stunning baskets\" out of the\nstones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before.was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A\nprivate remark was also circulated to the effect that \"Miss Jessie was\nstunningly pretty.\"The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully\nto send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off\nhighly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take\nthe afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the\nboys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two\no'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,\nconcerning the event to come off on the morrow.\"I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review,\" said\nJimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and\nlooking solemnly round the table.\"March about,\nand form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming\n\"parade rest,\" \"'der humps!\"and the rest of it; and finish off by\nfiring off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any\npossibility!\"\"But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder,\" said Peter\ndisconsolately.\"You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last\nFourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!\"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George\nsaid, \"You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.\"No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped\nthe 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the\nnasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play\nwith powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.\"\"Well, we must take it out in marching, then,\" said Freddy, with a\ntremendous sigh.\"No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!\"\"I have\nsome 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of\nthe cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother\nthis afternoon and get them.\"The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,\ncoming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the\nolder ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his\nbright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,\nhe heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,\nschoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy.\"I ran after you all the way,\" he pantingly said.\"I want to tell you,\ndear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,\nand how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as\nanything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and\nI feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable\ncourt martial.\"\"There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!\"was the hearty\nresponse; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion.\"It\nwas my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how\nsilly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.\"\"Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so\nwe will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this\nabominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to\ndescribe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed\nZouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the\nfollowing day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in\nhistory for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran\npoor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible\nvariety of exercise known to \"Hardee's Tactics,\" and nearly dislocated\ntheir shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward\nall at once when they went at \"double quick;\" at the same time keeping\nthe other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful\noperation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered\ndown nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and\na special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's\n\"'der arms!\"meant \"shoulder arms,\" and when \"order arms\" (or bringing\nall the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never\nwas such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of\nthe preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy\nclouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and\nnot a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of\nthe day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun\nwould be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry\nlet fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding\nhigh council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of\nat the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a\nmoment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn\nentered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of\neager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a\ncolony of rooks.\"Patience, patience, my good friends!\"Schermerhorn, holding\nup a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double\nheaders,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,\nand they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left\nfor you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in\ngeneral--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,\nand then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end\nof the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can\nhelp at present;\" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,\nunder strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which\nsuddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as\nthey could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four\no'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after\nanother, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and\nsoon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown\nreason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little\ntrilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,\nfolded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to\ndo with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in\nequal danger of irremediable \"mussing,\" as she fidgetted about on the\ncarriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs\nin the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best\nview of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the\nwhite tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a\nmagnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the\nlawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental\ngrounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view\nwas bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could\nbe seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit\nof regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice\nwas heard shouting, \"Are ye all ready now?and to\nthe melodious notes of \"Dixie,\" performed by the band, which was\nstationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry\nmarching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious\nmandates as, \"Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the\nhouse!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and\ngentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed\nZouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood\nlike statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,\nwhile Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:\n\n\"To the rear--open order!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.and the rear rank straightway fell back;\nexecuting, in fact, that wonderful \"tekkinapesstoth'rare\" which had\npuzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those\nother wonderful orders:\n\n          \"P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,\nwith such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond\nmeasure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on\neach side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,\ndeclared \"It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!\"a\ncelebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened\nhis pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at\nlast produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this\nvolume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they\nwould give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to\nthe gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: \"DOUBLE-QUICK.\"]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the\nregiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,\nformed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called \"breaking into\nplatoons,\" showed how to \"wheel on the right flank,\" and all manner of\nother mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the\norder, they started at \"double quick\" (which is the most comical\ntritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the\nlawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment\nmore were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once\nagain like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the\nZouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off\ntheir saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in\nreturn, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the\nlittle remaining breath they had after the \"double quick.\"Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of\ntheir rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went\nthrough some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and\njump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to\nrather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, \"Close up\nin ranks to dismiss,\" when Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and\nJessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,\n\"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony\nto go through with.\"The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could\nbe coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a\ngreat hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came\ntripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over\nher snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and\nblue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils\nencircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It\nwas made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was\npainted an American eagle, and on the other the words \"Dashahed\nZouaves,\" surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced\nto the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little\ntremulous, but very distinct, she said:\n\n          \"COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:\n\n          \"I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,\n          on the success you have achieved.You have shown\n          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a\n          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you\n          the colors of your regiment!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.\"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are\n          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you\n          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath\n          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down\n          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your\n          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name\n          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as\nhe advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our\nlittle Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member\nof the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have\nthought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with\nthe right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice\nthat he responded:\n\n          \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n\n          \"I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the\n          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,\n          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we\n          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness\n          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we\n          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we\n          fight, they shall never float over a retreating\n          battalion!\"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his\nhand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "still unsullied and bright,\n          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night\n          And the standard that guides us forever shall be\n          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.\"A handful of living--an army of dead,\n          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;\n          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain\n          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,\n          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see\n          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear\n          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;\n          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,\n          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,\n          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,\n          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the\nband struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves\nmarching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a\nbountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner\nof \"goodies,\" as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on\nthe sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a\nlarge flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the\nother officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took\ntheir seats.The other children found places around the table, and a\nmerrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively\nairs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,\nthat nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement\namong the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in\nsuch fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves\ntheir flag and music, while to Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the\nsupper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the\nbeginning of the week.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,\nof getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good\nfriends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.So there was a\npleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was\nquite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as\nthe company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the\nscene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and\ngentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly\npretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its\ncentre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all\ncrowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and\nadmiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and\nlistening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or\ngrown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,\ncentral figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful\nfor the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had\nscarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no\none else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he\nmoved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and\naffection.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier\nbeat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the\nyoung Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental\ncolors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes\nthem out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once\nmore the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with\nquivering lip and flashing eye, \"Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,\nI'll live and die a soldier!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful\nplanet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the\ncamp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly\nached; and then they all shook hands with \"dear\" Jessie, as Charley was\nheard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her\nsoft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she\ncertainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the\ngood people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving\ntheir handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and\nso, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended\nthe very end of\n\n                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that \"day of disaster,\" when Camp McClellan\nmust be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,\nthought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five\ndays, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very\nshortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the\nbreaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by\nthe early afternoon boat.\"Is it possible we have been here a week?\"<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple.exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat\ndown to breakfast.\"It seems as if we had only come yesterday.\"\"I don't want\nto go to Newport a bit.\"To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!\"added Tom, with a little\nblush.\"I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's\none too many rebels in the family.\"cried George Chadwick; \"the Pringles are a first rate\nfamily; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!\"and George gave\nTom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite\nbrought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and\nproceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not\nvery scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the\nbusiness was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and\nthen jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,\nand under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and\nplaced them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving\nthem to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;\nfor, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own\naffairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when\nit comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious\nlittle wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself\nout of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black\nCanadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall\nby a young lady in a saucy \"pork pie\" straw hat, who was driving--no\nother than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly\nsurrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, \"Jessie\nbegged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her.\"Really,\" repeated Freddy; \"but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just\nin time to see us off.\"\"You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all,\" said George;\n\"you will see the tents come down with a run presently.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.As he spoke, the donkey\ncart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and\nprepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,\ntwo of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from\none corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which\nsupported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated \"Now!\"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,\njust as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the\nfirst one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was\ndetached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and\ncharged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this\npurpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in\nhis hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it\nrapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, \"Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,\nthen, it is time to start for the boat.\"The boys turned and saw the\ncarriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to\nconvey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm\nwas rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony\nchaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to\nadore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and\nold Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate \"Good-by, my little\nColonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as\nlong as he lives.\"It would have seemed like insulting the old man to\noffer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome\ngilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of\nthe regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of\n\"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike.\"As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond\nthe capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on\nriding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of\ncarrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,\nwith that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with\nthree ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the\nregiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to\nsee the last of \"dear Jessie,\" until the locusts hid them from sight,\nwhen they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn\naccompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red\nbrickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the\nlovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party\ntook possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be\nwaiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers\nstreet, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the\ndepot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they\nhad to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this\nunusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers\nparading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,\nwhereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth\navenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine\nstyle, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping\nat the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one\nand another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon\nas possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they\nmarched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, \"I tell you\nwhat, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me\ngo to West Point as soon as I leave school!<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.I must be a soldier--I\ncan't think of anything else!\"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; \"and,\nFred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your\nregiment, won't you?\"answered Freddy; \"but you're the oldest, Tom,\nand, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget\nme when you come to your command!\"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to\ncome back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang\nthe bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of\neminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in\nhand, saying, \"Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll\nnever leave the Union!\"and the last words he heard Tom say were, \"No,\nby George, _never_!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history\nof Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends\nDr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had\nmany a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the\nbeautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed\nin every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and\nlearn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to\nBaltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join\nFreddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger\nin after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the\nfield, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant\nyoung friend,\n\n                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of \"Colonel\nFreddy,\" and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed\nand breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off\ntheir seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when\nanything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful\nstory that was seen \"before it was printed,\" and a great many \"oh's\" and\n\"ah's\" testified to their appreciation of the gallant \"Dashahed\nZouaves.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true\nstory of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had\nbeen read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang\nup once more, exclaiming; \"Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,\nmayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?\"cried his sister; \"I wish I had been Jessie; what a\npity it wasn't all true!\"\"And what if I should tell you,\" said their mother, laughing, \"that a\nlittle bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was\nwonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.\"Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more\nquestions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time\nthey paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg\nher to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about\nit.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at\nlast one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more\nstories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,\nwhich looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; \"Aunt Fanny's\ndaughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!\"and dressing himself in a\ndouble quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,\nforgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of\nlightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;\nshouting, \"Come, get up!here's another Sock story for\nus!\"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's\nstockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to\ntheir places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the\nwrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the\nwhole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored\nmaxim, \"The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;\" George, meanwhile,\nperforming a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his\nfather opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down\nstairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to\nexamine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was\nagain a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read\n\"GERMAN SOCKS.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\"These must be more stories like that\ndear 'Little White Angel.'\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the\nfirst story, it was found to be called, \"God's Pensioners;\" and\ncommenced, \"It was a cold--\" but stop!This book was to be devoted\nto \"Colonel Freddy;\" but if you will only go to Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Leavitt's, the\npublishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock\nStories.*       *       *       *       *\n\nTranscriber's Notes:\n\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 41, \"dilemna\" changed to \"dilemma\" (horns of this dilemma)\n\nPage 81, \"arttisically\" changed to \"artistically\" (his fork\nartistically)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the\nfruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and\ndraw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in\nthe English reports, are most prominent among them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.Wherever there\nis a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will\nbe an accident.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,\nin regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly\ndesirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges\nor at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of\nagents and passengers at stations.The effort in America, somewhat\nin advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the\nadoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been\ndirected towards the invention of an automatic system which at\none and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide\nfor all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the\nrisks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of\nnerves.Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English\nauthorities are of opinion that it cannot.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.They insist that \"if\nautomatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to\nthe duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be\nused as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery\nworked by competent signal-men.The signal-man should be bound to\nexercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and\nthe machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go\nwrong it shall check him.\"It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as\nyet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has\nundoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction.Of the\nvarious automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or\nbrought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal\nCompany systems have been developed to a very marked degree of\nperfection.They depend for their working on diametrically opposite\nprinciples: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric\ncircuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and\nconveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other\nsystem, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric\ncircuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected\nfor the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the\nbreaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and\ncars.So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential\ndifference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the\nnecessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in\nthe other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights.Of the\ntwo the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,\nhaving been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative\nprocess common to all inventions, during which they are regarded\nas of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a\nsuccession of partial failures.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.So far as Hall's system is concerned\nthis period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in\nestablished use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,\nand especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily\nincident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and\nso complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome.Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,\nstations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block\nsystem, through which it provides against dangers from collision and\nbroken tracks.So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection\nit affords is perfect.Not only is its interlocking apparatus so\ndesigned that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,\nbut the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or\nautomatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is\nnotified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it.In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell\nunder Hall's system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of\nthe approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile\nuntil it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents\ncan happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the\nhighway.When the electric bell is silent there is no train within\nhalf a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell\nis ringing.As it now stands the law usually provides that the\nprescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the\nlocomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance\nfrom it.The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several\nhundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.The electric\nsystem improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point\nof danger,--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell\napproaching the traveller.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.At any point of crossing which is really\ndangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or\nbuildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is\nvital.In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given\nand cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really\ngiven or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the\ndirection of the wind.Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more\ncrowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are\nprotected by gates or flag-men.Under similar circumstances in\nGreat Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the\ncabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block\nsystem on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of\nthe approach of trains from either direction.In this country it has\nheretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive\nwhistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the\ncrossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes.Under\nthe Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled\nto be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is\nneglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,\nwithout releasing the corporation from its liability.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.In America\nthe heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant\nhead lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the\nlocomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice\nto the most careless of an approaching train.Continually recurring\nexperience shows, however, that this is not the case.Under these\ncircumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a\nmatter of justice almost to the employ\u00e9 who is stationed there, but\na watchman over him.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been\nreferred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief\nuse, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown\ninto the bargain.As contradistinguished from the English block,\nwhich insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to\ninsure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment\ninto which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains\nby, in the case of Hall's system, double signals watching over each\nother, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to\ncombine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the\nthrowing of which may break the main track, is also protected.The\nUnion Signal Company's system it is claimed goes still further than\nthis and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental\nfracture or displacement of rails.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Without attempting this the Hall\nsystem has one other important feature in common with the English\nblock, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents\nin case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within\nhalf a mile or more of their stations on either side.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Within the\ngiven distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching.The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most\ndisastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at\nThorpe.The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,\nwhether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of\naccident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger.This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of\nthe wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means\nwithout precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could\nnot but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been\ntampered with.Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly\nbe provided for except by police precautions.Train wrecking is\nnot to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary\noperation of a railroad.Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,\nor, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary\nassumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost\ninseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the\ngreat sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against.The\ncomplicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand\nemploy\u00e9s, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and\ndid they not do so they would be either more or less than men.Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals\nwhose services are bought for money at the average market rate of\nwages, it would certainly seem no small point gained if an automatic\nmachine could be placed on guard over those whom it is the great\neffort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.Could this\nresult be attained, the unintentional throwing of a lever or the\ncarelessness which leaves it thrown, would simply block the track\ninstead of leaving it broken.An example of this, and at the same\ntime a most forcible illustration of the possible cost of a small\neconomy in the application of a safeguard, was furnished in the\ncase of the Wollaston disaster.At the time of that disaster, the\nOld Colony railroad had for several years been partially equipped\non the portion of its track near Boston, upon which the accident\noccurred, with Hall's system.It had worked smoothly and easily, was\nwell understood by the employ\u00e9s, and the company was sufficiently\nsatisfied with it to have even then made arrangements for its\nextension.Unfortunately, with a too careful eye to the expenditure\ninvolved, the line had been but partially equipped; points where\nlittle danger was apprehended had not been protected.Among these\nwas the \"Foundry switch,\" so called, near Wollaston.Had this switch\nbeen connected with the system and covered by a signal-target, the\nmere act of throwing it would have automatically blocked the track,\nand only when it was re-set would the track have been opened.The\nswitch was not connected, the train hands were recklessly careless,\nand so a trifling economy cost in one unguarded moment some fifty\npersons life and limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.One objection to the automatic block is generally based upon the\ndelicacy and complicated character of the machinery on which its\naction necessarily depends; and this objection is especially urged\nagainst those other portions of the Hall system, covering draws\nand level crossings, which have been particularly described.It\nis argued that it is always liable to get out of order from a\ngreat multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult to\nguard against, and that it is sure to get out of order during any\nelectric disturbance; but it is during storms that accidents are\nmost likely to occur, and especially is this the case at highway\ngrade-crossings.It is comparatively easy to avoid accidents so long\nas the skies are clear and the elements quiet; but it is exactly\nwhen this is not the case and when it becomes necessary to use every\nprecaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails or runs mad, and,\nby participating in the general confusion, proves itself worse\nthan nothing.Then it will be found that those in charge of trains\nand tracks, who have been educated into a reliance upon it under\nordinary circumstances, will from force of habit, if nothing else,\ngo on relying upon it, and disaster will surely follow.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the less open to\none serious objection; it is sustained neither by statistics nor\nby practical experience.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.Moreover it is not new, for, slightly\nvaried in phraseology, it has been persistently urged against the\nintroduction of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed, was first\nand most persistently of all urged against the introduction of\nrailroads themselves.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it\nis not feasible!--for more than half a century this formula has been\nheard.That the automatic electric signal system is complicated,\nand in many of its parts of most delicate construction, is\nundeniable.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.In point of fact the whole\nrailroad organization from beginning to end--from machine-shop to\ntrain-movement--is at once so vast and complicated, so delicate\nin that action which goes on with such velocity and power, that\nit is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all plain,\nsensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful creation of\nvisionaries.They were wholly justified in so doing; and to-day\nany sane man would of course pronounce the combined safety and\nrapidity of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility, did\nhe not see it going on before his eyes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk there.So it is with each new\nappliance.It is ever suggested that at last the final result has\nalready been reached.It is but a few years, as will presently be\nseen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered the old \"pretty and\ningenious\" formula.Going yet a step further, and taking the case\nof electricity itself, the bold conception of operating an entire\nline of single track road wholly as respects one half of its train\nmovement by telegraph, and without the use of any time table at\nall, would once have been condemned as mad.Yet to-day half of the\nvast freight movement of this continent is carried on in absolute\nreliance on the telegraph.Nevertheless it is still not uncommon\nto hear among the class of men who rise to the height of their\ncapacity in themselves being automaton superintendents that they do\nnot believe in deviating from their time tables and printed rules;\nthat, acting under them, the men know or ought to know exactly what\nto do, and any interference by a train despatcher only relieves them\nof responsibility, and is more likely to lead to accidents than if\nthey were left alone to grope their own way out.Another and very similar argument frequently urged against the\nelectric, in common with all other block systems by the large class\nwho prefer to exercise their ingenuity in finding objections rather\nthan in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed dependence and\ncare<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "This argument is, indeed, hardly less familiar than the \"pretty and\ningenious\" formula just referred to.It has, however, been met and\ndisposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports to the Board of\nTrade in a way which can hardly be improved upon:--\n\n     It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the introduction\n     of some of these improvements, or who make excuses for the want\n     of them, that their servants are apt to become more careless\n     from the use of them, in consequence of the extra security which\n     they are believed to afford; and it is desirable to consider\n     seriously how much of truth there is in this assertion.* * *\n     Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide too\n     much in additional means of safety, the risk is proved by\n     experience to be very much greater without them than with them;\n     and, in fact, the negligence and mistakes of servants are found\n     to occur most frequently, and generally with the most serious\n     results, not when the men are over-confident in their appliances\n     or apparatus, but when, in the absence of them, they are\n     habituated to risk in the conduct of the traffic.In the daily\n     practice of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,\n     engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in difficulties\n     which they have to surmount as best they can.The more they are\n     accustomed to incur risk in order to perform their duties, the\n     less they think of it, and the more difficult it is to enforce\n     discipline and obedience to regulations.The personal risk which\n     is encountered by certain classes of railway servants is coming\n     to be more precisely ascertained.It is very considerable;\n     and it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger\n     themselves from doing things which may be a source of danger to\n     others, or to compel them to obey regulations for which they do\n     not see altogether the necessity, and which impede them in their\n     work.This difficulty increases with the want of necessary means\n     and appliances; and is diminished when, with proper means and\n     appliances, stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes\n     of working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety is\n     constantly preserved.[14]\n\n  [14] Reports; 1872, page 23, and 1873, page 39.In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior appliances\nor greater personal comfort in some indefinable way lead to\ncarelessness in employ\u00e9s was carried to such an extent that only\nwithin the last few years has any protection against wind, rain and\nsunshine been furnished on locomotives for the engine-drivers and\nstokers.The old stage-coach driver faced the elements, and why\nshould not his successor on the locomotive do the same?--If made too\ncomfortable, he would become careless and go to sleep!--This was the\nline of argument advanced, and the tortures to which the wretched\nmen were subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying\nnature by drink.They had to be regularly inspected and examined\nbefore mounting the foot-board, to see that they were sober.It took\nyears in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn\nthat the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will\nattend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long\nexperience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,\nit, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and\nforce, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next\nnew safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the\nextracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block\nsystem from the increased carelessness of employ\u00e9s, supposed to be\ninduced by it, is entitled to no weight.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Neither is the argument\nfrom the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal\nsystem entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has\nit been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical\nresults, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of\nfact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not\nshow that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents\nduring periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train\nmovements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances\nmore especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the\nfull average of accidents of the worst description appear to\nhave occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and\nusually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of\naccidents at highway grade crossings.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.These commonly occur when the\nconditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose\nthat, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric\nsignals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,\nwith its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the\npurely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of\nproof is properly on the inventor.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been\nin limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been\nundergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable\ndegree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in\ntheir earlier stage of development.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.In use, however, they have not\nbeen found open to the practical objections urged against them.At\nfirst much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery\nthan could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more\ncare than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a\nsingle battery properly located can do all the necessary work for\na road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do\nnot lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph\nwires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance\ndoes take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a\ngeneral signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with\nrailroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of\naffairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident\nto exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,\nduring nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now\nthrough several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable\nsafeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they\nwill be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad\nconvergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage\nof trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,\nthe English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,\nindeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American\nmanagers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an\nindisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering\ntheir usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first\nsight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and\nsimple methods, just so long as they can through those methods\nhandle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and\nexpense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is\nmost extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two\nhouses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,\ncould be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is\nnot on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be\nmade very obvious by a comparison.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.Take, for instance, London and\nBoston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street\nstation in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so\ngreat that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground\ndevoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not\nonly must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be\nidle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already\nbeen referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing\nspectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result\nis that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,\nmore trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and\nleave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad\nstations in Boston combined.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.[15]\n\n  [15] \"It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,\n  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three\n  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of\n  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred\n  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from\n  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a\n  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional\n  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are\n  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen\n  hours.\"--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad\n  Commissioners, p.141._\n\n  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was\n  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours\n  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in\n  641 trains.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.About twice the passenger movement of the \"exceptional\n  day\" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of\n  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and\nleave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It\ncontains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is\n720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston\n& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate\nof 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily\naccommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many\npassengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: \"The platform area at this station is probably minimised\nbut, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic\nof long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as\n400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]\"\n\n  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has\n  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon\n  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be\n  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if\n  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to\n  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the\n  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being\nconducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks\nutilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it\nrequires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of\nmany employ\u00e9s.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London\nstandard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at\nthis time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working\ncapacity; and the same is probably true of all other American\ncities.Both employ\u00e9s and the travelling public are accustomed to a\nslow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,\nand the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself\nfelt.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the apple there.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the\nbusy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but\nbe struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive\nway in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all\nconnected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed\nfrom one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting\nof switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never\nstand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with\nsignals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection\nwith each other, and during thirty years no change has been made\nin the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be\nshifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk there.To facilitate the process,\nthe monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front\nand behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,\nand are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time\nthey would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could\nnot be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that\neven a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon\nit.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the\ntrain movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into\ninextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way\nwhich has been described.The number of trains is so great and\nthe movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of\nemploy\u00e9s stationed here and there at the signals and switches could\nkeep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then\nthe whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order\ncould be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple\nway, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over\nthe numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being\ndivided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated\nin the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is\nelevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding\nthe approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer\ncommands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means\nof what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal\nin the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has\nthe apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement\nof a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, \"there are here nearly\nseventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;\nthe number of combinations which would be possible if all the\nsignal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only\nby millions.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the\ninterlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,\nand all the others impossible.\"[17]\n\n  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical\ndetails of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one\nof the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in\nthe history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little\nknown in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find\nhere the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its\ngradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not\nbe out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals\non the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now\ncommonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,\nfor instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track\nconnection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks\nwere opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;\nand the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains\nincreased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,\nthe danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals\ndisplayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,\neven when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;\nand mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,\ntherefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or\nsignal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as\nis still almost universally the case in this country, to connect\nthem by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated\nat some convenient point for working, and placed under the control\nof one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was\nan improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of\nmistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of\nfirst making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal\nfor another was less liable to happen after the concentration of\nthe levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at\nany time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of\naccident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more\ncomplicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.In response to\nthis need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though\nnot until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable\ndegree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to\nrender it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary\nor agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give\ncontrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the\nsignal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the\nlevers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by\nside in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points\nand signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one\nor more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel\nwith it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the\nright or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in\ncertain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any\nother.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The\napparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with\na clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,\narises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and\nas such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,\nhowever, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the\noperator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which\na fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the\nformer the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,\nbest be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest\nthat can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track\nbranch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would\nin this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal\nlevers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations.\"The\nsignal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points\nmight occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position\nof the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible\nonly thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an\nengine-driver into danger.\"[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,\n  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little\n  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by\n  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of\ncertain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when\nmoved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of\niron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or\nnotched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar\nopposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their\nother ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily\nfollowed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro\nbetween them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of\nthe locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other\nlevers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus\nsecuring them in certain positions, and making it impossible for\nthem to be in any other positions.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement\non anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,\nand naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great\nthat they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied\nupon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new\nappliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced\na new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and\nswitches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points\nthemselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great\nexertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which\nwas a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper\nlength of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make\nit certain in each case that the switch points were brought into\nexactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,\nor quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when\nit was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch\ncaught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by\na clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the\nspring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process\nof interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and\nthe keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon\neach other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole\nprocess is effected.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.The result of this improvement was that, as\nthe switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is\nfastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he\nwill, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers\ncannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means\nof this improvement, the mere \"intention of the signal-man to move\nany lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the\nspring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in\nforce, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]\"\n\n  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,\n  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting\n  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in\n  his report on the accidents during 1870.\"When the apparatus is\n  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman\n  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which\n  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering\n  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his\n  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver\n  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Such a mistake was\n  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,\n  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but\n  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value\n  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect\n  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more\n  extensively applied on the older lines.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk.Without it, a signalman in\n  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or\n  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less\n  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to\n  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing\n  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by\n  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of\n  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,\n  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by\n  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally\n  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such\n  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines\n  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in\n  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct\n  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in\n  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'\"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has\n  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,\n  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a\n  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above\n  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking\n  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so\n  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur\n  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be\nurged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable\nadjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For\nthe elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption\nproved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,\netc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an\nessential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely\nimaginary.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.Difficulties from this source were long since met and\novercome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice\noccasion no inconvenience.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.That rods may break, and that wires are\nat all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet\nthis fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical\nimprovement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always\noccasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also\nbe admitted.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and\ndaily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the\nheaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of\nthe interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out\nof gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement\ngoes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]\n\n  [20] \"As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes\n  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing\n  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain\n  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern\n  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of\n  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually\n  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in\n  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the\n  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to\n  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as\n  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is\n  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point\n  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of\n  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the\n  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without\n  accident_.\"<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there._Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._\n\nIt is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and\njunctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.It is also\nthe scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling\ntrains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach\ngrade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from\nthe consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with\npatience of the existing American substitute for it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.If the former\nis a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of\nthe block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing\ndisgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is\ncompatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage\nof trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be\ndevised.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be\nfound in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,\nfor instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which\nmay, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that\nthe one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the\nmethod adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but\nfrequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.It\nhas already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws\nin bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported\nduring the last nine years.The security afforded in this case\nby interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the\napparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be\nclosed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as\nrespects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing\nall trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings\nis a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a\nmatter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six\nyears 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these\ncrossings.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine\ncases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both\nthe years 1877 and 1878 under the head of \"Accidents or Collisions\non Level Crossings of Railways,\" the chief inspector of the Board\nof Trade tersely stated that,--\"No accident was inquired into under\nthis head.[21]\" The interlocking system there affords the most\nperfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous\npractice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost\nrecklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that\nthe interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard\nin this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track\nroad involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most\ndangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New\nYork, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all\nday long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty\nmiles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so\nto do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible\nthat one track should be open except when the other is closed.An\naccident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness\nof the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful\ncarelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in\ncontrol of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always\ndo it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus\nnot only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact\nalways does.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the apple.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold\ngood at level crossings.There is no essential difference between\nthe two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can\nbe so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that\nwhen one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,\nthe apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.Unlike the rule\nas to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of\nindividuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and\nif they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.So\nsuperior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as\nwell as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as\nan inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,\nit would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and\nConnecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation\nof the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable\ninterlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable\nthat in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] \"As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing\n  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a\n  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At\n  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted\n  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or\n  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be\n  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and\n  more expressly where express and fast trains are run.\"_Report on\n  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._\n\nIn any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking\napparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a\nmere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,\nat whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent\nstation buildings far removed from business centres, the train\nmovement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The\nexpense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple\nprocess of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several\nstation buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,\nhowever, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come\nwhen the financial and engineering audacity of the great English\ncompanies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company\nshall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite\nthe head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern\nestablished itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying\nits road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the\nState-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as\nto afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same\nterminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of\nthat busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room\nand market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have\ncome for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of\nspace to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also\nwill it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly\nand intricate", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly\nReview_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway\nsystem, the first vague anticipation of which was then just\nbeginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very\nintelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for\nhis article a permanence of interest he little expected by the\nuse of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to\ndraw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational\nanticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who\nwere boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they\nclaimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred\nto the proposition that passengers would be \"whirled at the rate\nof eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure\nengine,\" and then contemptuously added,--\"We should as soon expect\nthe people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one\nof Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy\nof such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they\nmay trust.\"Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable\none.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the\nimpossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would\nnaturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections\nto the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving\na sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of\nrapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a\ncondition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history\nof railroad development that the improvement in appliances for\ncontrolling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of\nspeed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion\nis concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_\ncould not have held its own very respectably by the side of a\npassenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered\nthat on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen\nmiles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive\nconstruction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great\nchange has been or probably will be effected in the matter of\nvelocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached\nat once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very\nmuch what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,\nbut the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden\nemergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control\nover the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the\nwhistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as\nsoon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles\nan hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it\npasses over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it\npasses over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing\nan engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the\ntrack, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train\nbehind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,\nand to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented\nmany feet of space.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,\nthat when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it\nwas ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars\nmoving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought\nto a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a\ndistance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was\narrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola\nand at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains\nin less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were\ndragging and plunging along at the end of them.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive\nand under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been\nemphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of\naccidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need\nalmost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented\nwith both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,\nthese had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency\nbrakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and\nthey were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon\nfor ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against\nspecial exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg\naccident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the\noperation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually\nfound of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no\ncontinuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's\ninvention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had\nbecome a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,\nand they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of\nthe sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a\nmost unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to\nfight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with\nmaster mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first\npatents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful\naid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car\nCompany, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance\nof safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the\nnew brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and\nhad nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their\nsupport was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so\ncomplicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to\na thing which was already overburdened with machinery.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.There was,\nalso, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this\nnew contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting\ntubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful\nto the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the\nidea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no\nmeans new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by\nit wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet\nthe application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad\ntrain seemed no less novel than it was bold.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.It was, in the first\nplace, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging\nand hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely\nbe subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,\nbut without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and\npatronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no\ndoubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was\ntersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts\nin London, as recently as May, 1877,--\"It was no use bringing out\na brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which\nwas so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not\nunderstand it.\"A line of argument by the way, which, as has been\nalready pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the\nlocomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied\nabout half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it\nnow, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the\nlate George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few\nmore effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and\nagainst the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,\nthat even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western\nroads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious\ndevice of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere\ndisaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,\nwould unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train\nbeen provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious\nattention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere\nsuggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable\nhand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;\nand at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been\nreferred to as having been called by the state commissioners\nafter the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the\nroad under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,\nindignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the\ngood, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently\nstake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of\nthat ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the\nsort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great\ndynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents\nagain asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional\nrailroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly\nyielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the\nexhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in\nMassachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with\ntrain-brakes.[23]\n\n  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those\nrequisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have\nlaid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse\nstands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is\nnow a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was\nthen simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it\nhas since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its\nfundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood\nto call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the\nboiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an\natmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under\nthe cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the\ntrain.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious\nand, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once\npointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was\npersistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the\napparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them\nwas always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage\nclaimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could\nbe placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,\ntherefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any\nderangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the\ntrain would have that something was wrong might well come in the\nshape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one\nrailroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the\napproach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of\nthis failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act\ndid in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted\nin disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated\nin the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw\nFerry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with\nthe ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly\nafter 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through\nthe station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and\nsupports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the\nlocomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no\none was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on\nthe evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a\nfew moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train\ncame along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train\nsaw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his\nbrake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury\nof one employ\u00e9 and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and\nlocomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first\nof these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk\ndisaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to\nwork at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at\nFranklin street.It might just\nas well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not\nin the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and\nsuch significant intimations are not to be disregarded.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.The chances\nare naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act\nwill not at once occur under just those circumstances which will\nentail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if\nsuch intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later\nso occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to\nwork was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might\nwell be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,\nas the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus\nmight be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,\nand the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,\nor, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked\nmomentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at\nWollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to\nthat accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he\ntermed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the\nthing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at\ndanger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was\nautomatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake\nwas thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the\ntrain.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in\nEngland, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was\napproaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an\nhour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had\nleft the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings\nand went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic\nbrakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which\nfinally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the\nNorth Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at\na speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some\nreason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic\nbrake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon\neach other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be\nindistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of\none of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards\ntaken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been\ndriven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In\ncase of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,\nshould these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent\nstoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source\nof serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical\nexperience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated\nportion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected\nand not liable to get out of order.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.[24] Should it become deranged\nit will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it\nbelongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only\nfrom causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the\ndefect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of\nTrade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular\nservice these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for\ninstance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first\nran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there\nwere eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each\noccasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers\none occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the\nCaledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due\nto the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating\nover 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These\nfailures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,\nwhere the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent\nthat it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle\non which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains\nwent on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious\naccident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the\nWemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine\ndriver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake\nslightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the\ndistant and home signals, as they are called in the English block\nsystem.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake\ncould be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter\nupon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some\nthirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,\nas the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,\nwas due not at all to the automatic brake, but to \"carelessness\non the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the\nworking of the block telegraph instruments,\" and to the driver\nof the colliding train, who \"disobeyed the company's running\nregulations.\"It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of\none of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are\noperated, to read that in this case the fog was \"so thick that the\ntail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a\nfew yards.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple there.[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by\n  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer\n  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the\n  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the\n  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to\n  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple\n  valve: \"As the most important [of these modifications] I will\n  particularly draw your attention to the \"triple-valve\" which has\n  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has\n  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,\n  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well\n  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily\n  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and\n  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on\n  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity.\"[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due\n  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were\n  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million\n  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops\n  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employ\u00e9s with\n  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did\n  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,\n  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest\n  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four\n  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,\nthere remained but one further improvement necessary to render\nthe Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of\nself-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made\nfor graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied\nin the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest\nstop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of\nno little importance.As is well known a too severe application of\nbrakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand\nstill and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to\nrolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which\nslide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose\nbusiness it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to\nslide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the\npressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very\ngreat when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and\nshould then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the\ntrain, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been\nto engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not\nbeen conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the\nreport of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,\nit was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by\nthe action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,\nas recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London\nat one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with\nthe letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising\nassertion that \"no brake could do more than skid the wheels of\na train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he\nbelieved did so about equally well.\"Now, what it is here asserted\nno brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to\ndo,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,\nenables his brake to do.It much more than \"skids the wheels,\" by\nmeasuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the\nwheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always\nexerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means\nof a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake\ncylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks\non the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the\nbrake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself\nautomatically as the \"coefficient of dynamic friction augments with\nthe reduction of train speed.\"It hardly needs to be said that in\nthis way the power of the brake is enormously increased.She was not with her foster-mother, nor did his inquiry reveal her\nwhereabouts.He smiled sadly, as he thought of her out on the shales,\nher customary refuge when storms broke.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.He started in search of her;\nbut as he passed through the _plaza_ Manuela Cortez met him.\"Padre,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"is the little Carmen to go to jail, too?\"\"Manuela--why do you say that?\"he asked\nhurriedly, his heart starting to beat like a trip-hammer.\"Because, Padre, I saw the constable, Fernando, take her into Don\nMario's house some time ago.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.Jose uttered an exclamation and started for the house of the Alcalde.Don Mario stood at the door, his huge bulk denying the priest\nadmission.Fernando, who had been sitting just within the door, rose and came to\nhis chief's side.Fernando stepped\noutside and took his arm.The Alcalde's unlovely face expanded in a\nsinister leer.\"It is permissible to place even a priest in the\nstocks, if he becomes _loco_,\" he said significantly.Fernando spoke quickly:\n\n\"It was necessary to take the girl in custody, too, Padre.But do not\nworry; she is safe.\"\"But--you have no right to take her--\"\n\n\"There, _Senor Padre_, calm yourself.What right had you to separate\nher from her father?\"And, Don Mario, you have no\nauthority but his--\"\n\n\"You mistake, _Senor Padre_,\" calmly interrupted the Alcalde.he muttered, scarce hearing\nhis own words.\"The Bishop's, _Senor Padre_,\" answered Don Mario, with a cruel grin.But--the old man--\"\n\n\"_Na_, _Senor Padre_, but the Bishop is fairly young, you know.That\nis, the new one--\"\n\n\"The new one!\"\"To be sure, _Senor Padre_, the new Bishop--formerly Senor Don\nWenceslas Ortiz.\"Jose beat the air feebly as his hand sought his damp brow.\"_Bien_, _Senor Padre_,\" put in Fernando gently, pitying the priest's\nagony.The old Bishop of Cartagena died suddenly some days ago, and Don\nWenceslas at once received the temporary appointment, until the\nvacancy can be permanently filled.There is talk of making Cartagena\nan archbishopric, and so a new bishop will not be appointed until that\nquestion is settled.Meanwhile, Don Wenceslas administers the affairs\nof the Church there.\"\"And he--he--\" stammered the stunned priest.\"To be sure, _Senor Padre_,\" interrupted Don Mario, laughing aloud;\n\"the good Don Wenceslas no doubt has learned of the beautiful Carmen,\nand he cannot permit her to waste her loveliness in so dreary a place\nas Simiti.And so he summons her to Cartagena, in care of his agent,\nPadre Diego, who awaits the girl now in Banco to conduct her safely\ndown the river.At least, this is what Padre Diego writes me._Bien_,\nit is the making of the girl, to be so favored by His Grace!\"Jose staggered and would have fallen, had not Fernando supported him.But as he went he spitefully hurled\nback:\n\n\"_Bien_, _Senor Padre_, whom have you to blame but yourself?You keep\na child from her suffering father--you give all your time to her,\nneglecting the other poor children of your parish--you send Rosendo\ninto the mountains to search for La Libertad--you break your\nagreement with me, for you long ago said that we should work\ntogether--is it not so?You find gold in the mountains, but you do\nnot tell me._Na_, you work against me--you oppose my authority as\nAlcalde--_Bien_, you opposed even the authority of the good\nBishop--may he rest with the Saints!You have not made a good priest\nfor Simiti, _Senor Padre_--_na_, you have made a very bad one!And\nnow you wonder that the good Don Wenceslas takes the girl from you,\nto bring her up in the right way.if it is not already too\nlate to save her from your bad teachings!\"His voice steadily rose\nwhile he talked, and ended in a shrill pipe.Jose made as if to reach him; but Fernando held him back.The Alcalde\ngot quickly within the house and secured the door.\"Go now to your\nhome, Padre,\" urged Fernando; \"else I shall call help and put you in\nthe stocks, too!\"shouted\nJose desperately, struggling to gain the Alcalde's door.cried Fernando, holding to the frenzied man.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.\"The little Carmen--she is not in there!\"Then where is she, Fernando?--for God's sake tell\nme!\"Great beads of perspiration stood\nupon his face, and tears rolled down his drawn cheeks.\"_Bien_, Padre,\" he said gently;\n\"come away.I give you my word that the girl is not in the house of\nthe Alcalde.But I am not permitted to say where she is.\"\"Then I will search every house in Simiti!\"\"_Na_, Padre, you would not find her.He took Jose's arm again and led him, blindly stumbling, to the parish\nhouse.By this time the little town was agog with excitement.People ran from\nhouse to house, or gathered on the street corners, discussing the\nevent.\"_Caramba!_\" shrilled one wrinkled beldame, \"but Simiti was very quiet\nuntil the _Cura_ came!\"\"_Na_, senora,\" cried another, \"say, rather, until that wicked little\nhada was brought here by Rosendo!\"\"_Cierto_, she is an _hada_!\"put in a third; \"she cured Juanita of\ngoitre by her charms!I myself saw her come from\nthe old church on the hill one day!I say,\nshe was talking with the bad angel which the blessed Virgin has locked\nin there!\"\"Yes, and I have seen her coming from the cemetery.She talks with the\nbuzzards that roost on the old wall, and they are full of evil\nspirits!\"\"And she brought the plague two years ago--who knows?\"But it was not the real plague, anyway.\"\"_Bueno_, and that proves that she caused it, no?\"\"_Cierto_, _senora_, she cast a spell on the town!\"Jose sat in his little house like one in a dream.Dona Maria had gone to the jail to see Rosendo.Juan had\nreturned that morning to Bodega Central, and Lazaro was at work on the\nplantation across the lake.Jose thought bitterly that the time had\nbeen singularly well chosen for the _coup_.Don Mario's last words\nburned through his tired brain like live coals.In a sense the Alcalde\nwas right.He had been selfishly absorbed in the girl.But he alone,\nexcepting Rosendo, had any adequate appreciation of the girl's real\nnature.To the stagnant wits of Simiti she was one of them, but with\nsingular characteristics which caused the more superstitious and less\nintelligent to look upon her as an uncanny creature, possessed of\noccult powers.Moreover, Jose had duped Don Mario with assurances of cooeperation.He\nhad allowed him to believe that Rosendo was searching for La Libertad,\nand that he should participate in the discovery, if made.Had his\ncourse been wholly wise, after all?it was all to save an innocent child from the blackest\nof fates!If he had been stronger himself, this never could have\nhappened.Or, perhaps, if he had not allowed himself to be lulled to\nsleep by a fancied security bred of those long months of quiet, he\nmight have been awake and alert to meet the enemy when he returned to\nthe attack.the devil had left him for a season, and Jose had\nlaid down \"the shield of faith,\" while he lost himself in the\nintellectual content which the study of the new books purchased with\nhis ancestral gold had afforded.But evil sleeps not; and with a\npersistency that were admirable in a better cause, it returned with\nunbated vigor at the moment the priest was off his guard.*       *       *       *       *\n\nDawn broke upon a sleepless night for Jose.The Alcalde had sent word\nthat Fernando must remain with the priest, and that no visits would be\npermitted to Rosendo in the jail.Jose had heard nothing from Carmen,\nand, though often during the long night he sought to know, as she\nwould, that God's protection rested upon her; and though he sought\nfeebly to prove the immanence of good by knowing no evil, the morning\nfound him drawn and haggard, with corroding fear gnawing his desolate\nheart.Fernando remained mute; and Dona Maria could only learn that\nthe constable had been seen leading the girl into Don Mario's house\nshortly after Rosendo's arrest.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.At an early hour the people, buzzing with excitement, assembled for\nthe trial, which was held in the town hall, a long, empty adobe house\nof but a single room, with dirt floor, and a few rough benches.The\nAlcalde occupied a broken chair at one end of the room.The trial\nitself was of the simplest order: any person might voice his opinion;\nand the final verdict was left to the people.In a shaking voice, his frame tremulous with nervous agitation,\nRosendo recounted the birth of the child at Badillo, and the manner of\nher coming into his family.He told of Diego's appointment to Simiti,\nand of the loss of his own daughter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Waxing more and more energetic as\nhis recital drew out, he denounced Diego as the prince of liars, and\nas worthy of the violent end which he was certain to meet if ever that\nrenegade priest should venture near enough for him to lay his hands\nupon him.The little locket was produced, and all present commented on\nthe probable identity of the girl's parents.Many affected to detect a\nresemblance to Diego in the blurred photograph of the man.Don Mario swore loudly that it could be no other.Diego had often talked to him, sorrowfully, and in terms of deepest\naffection, about the beautiful woman whose love he had won, but whom\nhis vows of celibacy prevented from making his lawful wife.The\nAlcalde's recital was dramatic to a degree, and at its close several\nexcitedly attempted to address the multitude at the same time.Oratory flowed on an ever rising tide, accompanied by much violent\ngesticulation and expectoration by way of emphasis.At length it was\nagreed that Diego had", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "The day\nwas almost carried when the eloquent Alcalde, in glowing rhetoric,\npainted the splendid future awaiting the girl, under the patronage of\nthe Bishop.How cruel to retain her in dreary little Simiti, even\nthough Diego's claim still remained somewhat obscure, when His Grace,\nlearning of her talents, had summoned her to Cartagena to be educated\nin the convent for a glorious future of service to God!Ah, that a\nlike beautiful career awaited all the children of Simiti!Jose at length forced himself before the people and begged them to\nlisten to him.But, when he opened his mouth, the words stumbled and\nhalted.To tell these people that he was\nstriving to educate the girl away from them was impossible.To say\nthat he was trying to save her from the Church would be fatal.And to\nreiterate that Diego's claim was a fabrication, added nothing of value\nto the evidence, for what did he know of the child's parentage?He\nfeebly begged them to wait until Diego's claim had been either\ncorroborated or annulled.But no; they had the Bishop's corroboration,\nand that sufficed.cried Don Mario, interrupting the\npriest in a loud voice, \"if we oppose the Bishop, then will he send\nthe government soldiers to us--and you know what--\"\n\n\"_Cielo_, yes!\"The case now\nrested with her God.The people drew apart in little groups to discuss the matter.Don\nMario's beady eyes searched them, until he was certain of the way the\ntide was flowing.\"_Bueno_, _amigos y amigas_,\" he began with immense dignity; \"what say\nyou if we sum up the case as follows: The proofs have the support of\nthe Bishop, and show that the girl is the daughter of Padre Diego.Rosendo is guilty of having kept her from her own father, and for that\nhe should be severely punished.Let him be confined in the jail for\nsix months, and be forced to pay to us a fine of one thousand _pesos\noro_--\"\n\n\"_Caramba_!but he has no such sum,\" cried the people with mouths\nagape.\"_Bien_, I say he can get it!\"retorted the Alcalde, looking meaningly\nat Jose.\"And he should pay it for depriving the child of a father's\nlove and the religious instruction which he would have given her!\"\"Will you not remember that more than that amount is due Rosendo for\nthe care of the child?The whimsical, fickle people broke into excited exclamations.\"_Cierto!_\"\n\n\"The _Cura_ is right!\"\"Let Rosendo pay no fine--he has no gold, anyway!\"The Alcalde saw that he had gone a bit too far.\"_Bueno_, then,\" he\namended.\"We will cancel both the fine and Padre Diego's debt to\nRosendo, and the sentence shall be reduced to--what say you all?\"\"A month in the jail, Don Mario, no more,\" suggested one.An exclamation of approval from the crowd drowned the protest which\nJose sought vainly to voice.Rosendo rose quickly; but Fernando and\nothers seized him.\"_Bien_, it is approved,\" bawled the Alcalde, waving his thick arms.\"Take the prisoner to the _carcel_, _Senor Policia_,\" turning to the\nconstable.\"And the girl, Senor the Alcalde--when will you send her to her\nfather?\"\"Yes, Don Mario, she must be taken to Padre Diego at once,\" piped a\nwoman's shrill voice.\"_Bien_,\" shouted the Alcalde, following his words with a long, coarse\nlaugh, \"I was wise enough to know what you would decide, and sent the\ngirl down the river last night!\"CHAPTER 25\n\n\nThe candles and smoky oil lamps of Banco threw a fitful shimmer out\nupon the great river, casting huge, spectral shadows across its muddy,\nswirling waters, and seeming rather to intensify the blackness that\nlay thick and menacing upon its restless bosom.Rivermen who follow\ntheir hazardous calling along the Magdalena do not lightly risk the\ndangers of travel by night in their native canoes, when at any moment\na false stroke, a sudden crash against a tossing forest tree, and a\ncry through the inky blackness, might sound to the straining ears of\nhushed listeners on the distant banks the elements of another of the\nmighty river's grim nocturnal tragedies.But on the night following the trial of Rosendo in distant Simiti a\ncanoe stole like a thing ashamed through the heavy shadows along the\nriver's margin, and poked its blunt nose into the ooze at the upper\nedge of the town.Its two scantily clad _bogas_, steaming with\nperspiration and flecked with mud from the charged waters, sprang\nlightly from the frail craft and quickly made it fast to one of the\nlong stilts upon which a ramshackle frame house rested.Then they\nassisted the third occupant of the canoe, a girl, to alight; and\ntogether they wended their way up the slippery bank and toward the\ntown above.\"_Caramba_, _compadre_!\"ejaculated one of the men, stumbling into a\ndeep rut, \"it is well you know where we go.but I travel no\nmore on the river by night.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.And, _compadre_, we had best ask Padre\nDiego to offer a

of\nSimiti because you were not married to your woman.You cannot\ncomplain, _compadre_.\"\"_Caramba!_ I have yet to see the color of the _pesos_.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.I do not much\ntrust your Padre Diego.\"\"_Na, amigo_, a bit of rum will put new life into your soaked gizzard._Cierto_, this trip down the river was a taste of purgatory; but you\nknow we may as well get used to it here, for when we _pobres_ are dead\nwho will buy Masses to get us out?\"\"_Caramba!_\" muttered the other sullenly, as he stumbled on through\nthe darkness, \"but if we have no money the priests will let us burn\nforever!\"The girl went along with the men silently and without complaint, even\nwhen her bare feet slipped into the deep ruts in the trail, or were\npainfully bruised and cut by the sharp stones and bits of wood that\nlay in the narrow path.The man addressed as Julio\nassisted her to her feet.The other broke into a torrent of profane\nabuse.\"_Na, Ricardo,_\" interrupted Julio, \"hold your foolish tongue and let\nthe girl alone!You and I have cursed all the way from Simiti, but she\nhas made no complaint._Caramba_, I wish I were well\nout of this business!\"A few minutes later they struck one of the main thoroughfares.Then\nthe men stopped to draw on their cotton shirts and trousers before\nentering the town.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.The road was better here, and they made rapid\nprogress.The night was far spent, and the streets were deserted.In\nthe main portion of the town ancient Spanish lamps, hanging\nuncertainly in their sconces against old colonial houses, threw a\nfeeble light into the darkness.Before one of the better of these\nhouses Julio and the girl were halted by their companion.\"_Bien_,\" he said, \"it is here that the holy servant of God lives._Caramba_, but may his _garrafon_ be full!\"They entered the open door and mounted the stone steps.On the floor\nabove they paused in the rotunda, and Ricardo called loudly.A side\ndoor opened and a young woman appeared, holding a lighted candle\naloft.\"_El Senor Padre, senorita\nAna?_\" he said, bowing low.\"You will do us the favor to announce our\narrival, no?\"The woman stared uncomprehendingly at the odd trio.\"The Padre is not\nhere,\" she finally said.\"_Dios y diablo!_\" cried Ricardo, forgetting his courtesy.\"But we\nhave risked our skins to bring him the brat, and he not here to\nreceive and reward us!_Caramba!_\"\n\n\"But--Ricardo, he is out with friends to-night--he may return at any\nmoment.She stepped\nforward, holding the candle so that its light fell full upon her face.As she did this the girl darted toward her and threw herself into the\nwoman's arms.she cried, her voice breaking with emotion, \"Anita--I am\nCarmen!The little Carmen,\nmy father's--\"\n\n\"Yes, Anita, I am padre Rosendo's Carmen--and yours!\"What brings\nyou here, of all places?\"\"As you may see, senorita, it is\nwe who have brought her here, at the command of her father, Padre\nDiego.\"And, since you say he is not in, we must wait until he\nreturns.\"The woman stood speechless with amazement.Carmen clung to her, while\nRicardo stood looking at them, with a foolish leer on his face.Julio\ndrew back into the shadow of the wall.\"_Bien, senorita_,\" said Ricardo, stepping up to the child and\nattempting to take her arm, \"we will be held to account for the girl,\nand we must not lose her._Caramba!_ For then would the good Padre\ndamn us forever!\"Julio emerged swiftly from the shadow and\nlaid a restraining hand on Ricardo.The woman tore Carmen from his\ngrasp and thrust the girl behind herself.\"_Cierto_, friend Ricardo,\nwe are all responsible for her,\" she said quickly.\"But you are tired\nand hungry--is it not so?Let me take you to the _cocina_, where you\nwill find roast pig and a bit of red rum.\"\"_Caramba!_ my throat is like the ashes\nof purgatory!\"\"Come, then,\" said the woman, holding Carmen tightly by the hand and\nleading the way down the steps to the kitchen below.Arriving there,\nshe lighted an oil lamp and hurriedly set out food and a large\n_garrafon_ of Jamaica rum.\"There, _compadre_, is a part of your reward.And we will now wait\nuntil Padre Diego arrives, is it not so?\"While the men ate and drank voraciously, interpolating their actions\nat frequent intervals with bits of vivid comment on their river trip,\nthe woman cast many anxious glances toward the steps leading to the\nfloor above.From time to time she replenished Ricardo's glass, and\nurged him to drink.Physical exhaustion\nand short rations while on the river had prepared him for just what\nthe woman most desired to accomplish, and as glass after glass of the\nfiery liquor burned its way down his throat, she saw his scant wit\nfading, until at last it deserted him completely, and he sank into a\ndrunken torpor.Then, motioning to Julio, who had consumed less of the\nrum, she seized the senseless Ricardo by the feet, and together they\ndragged him out into the _patio_ and threw him under a _platano_\ntree.\"But, senorita--\" began Julio in remonstrance, as thoughts of Diego's\nwrath filtered through his befuddled brain.\"If you lay a\nhand upon this child my knife shall find your heart!\"\"How much did Padre Diego say he would give you?\"\"Three _pesos oro_--and rations,\" replied the man thickly.\"Wait here, then, and I will bring you the money.\"Still retaining Carmen's hand, she mounted the steps, listening\ncautiously for the tread of her master.Reaching the rotunda above,\nshe drew Carmen into the room from which she had emerged before, and,\nbidding her conceal herself if Diego should arrive, took her wallet\nand hastily descended to where the weaving Julio

sense of his danger,\nlost no time in making his exit.Returning to Carmen, the woman seated herself and drew the girl to\nher.she cried, trembling, as her eyes searched the\ngirl.\"I do not know, Anita dear,\" murmured the girl, nestling close to the\nwoman and twining an arm about her neck; \"except that day before\nyesterday the Alcalde put padre Rosendo into the jail--\"\n\n\"Into the jail!\"And then, when I was going to see him, Fernando ran\nout of Don Mario's house and told me I must go in and see the Alcalde.Julio Gomez and this man Ricardo were there talking with Don Mario in\nthe _patio_.Then they threw a _ruana_ over me and carried me out\nthrough the _patio_ and around by the old church to the Boque trail.When we got to the trail they made me walk with them to the Inanea\nriver, where they put me into a canoe.They paddled fast, down to the\nBoque river; then to the Magdalena; and down here to Banco.They did\nnot stop at all, except when steamboats went by--oh, Anita, I never\nsaw a steamboat before!But Padre\nJose had often told me about them.And when the big boats passed us\nthey made me lie down in the canoe, and they put the _ruana_ over me\nand told me

comes!_Santa Maria_, I will--\"\n\n\"Anita dear,\" murmured the girl, sinking down between the white\nsheets, \"you and I will just _know_ that God is everywhere, and\nthat He will take care of us,

as a heavy step fell outside the door.Ana sprang up and extinguished the lamp, then went quickly out into\nthe rotunda.Padre Diego was standing on the top step, puffing and\nweaving unsteadily.The woman hurried to him and passed an arm about\nhis waist.she exclaimed in a tone of feigned solicitation.\"I feared you\nhad met with an accident!Why\ndo you stay out so late and cause me worry?\"The

he staggered across the rotunda\nand into the room where long before he had entertained for a brief\nhour Don Jorge and the priest Jose.Ana quickly broke the neck of a\nbottle of the newly arrived

babbled\nlike a child.He nodded; struggled to keep awake; and at length fell\nasleep with his head on her shoulder.Then she arose, and, assured\nthat he would be long in his stupor, extinguished the light and\nhurried to her own room.The woman bent over her with the\nlighted candle and looked long and wistfully.she\nprayed, \"if you will but save her, you may do what you will with me!\"Tears flowed freely down her cheeks as she turned to the door and\nthrew the bolt.Coming back to the bed, she again bent over the\nsleeping girl._Dios mio_--and that beast, he has seen her, and he would--ah,\n_Dios_!\"Going again to the dresser, she took from a drawer a sandalwood\nrosary.Then she returned to the bed and knelt beside the child.\"Blessed Virgin,\" she prayed, while her hot tears fell upon the beads,\n\"I am lost--lost!Ah, I have not told my beads for many years--I\ncannot say them now!_Santa Virgen_, pray for me--pray for me--and if\nI kill him to-morrow, tell the blessed

\"I am too wicked to sleep with so pure an angel!--no, I can\nnot!She spread a light shawl upon the tile floor near the window and lay\ndown upon it, drawing a lace _mantilla_ over her face to protect it\nfrom the mosquitoes.\"_Santa Virgen_\", she murmured repeatedly, \"pray\nthe blessed Saviour to protect her to-morrow--pray for her, _Madre de\nDios_--pray for her!\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe piercing shriek of a steamboat whistle roused the woman just as\nthe first harbingers of dawn spread over the river a crimson flush\nthat turned it into a stream of blood.Ana bent\nover her and left a kiss on her forehead.Then she stole out of the\nroom and into the study.Padre Diego lay sunk in his chair like a\nmonster toad.The woman threw him a look of utter loathing, and then\nhastily descended into the _patio_.Ricardo lay under the _platano_\ntree, sleeping heavily.\"Padre Diego sends\nyou this money, and bids you go.She held out a roll of _pesos_.The man, after much vigorous persuasion, got heavily to his feet.\"_Caramba, senorita_!\"\"That last\n_tragito_--it was a bit too much, no?But--_Bien_, I would see the\ngood Padre.But, senorita, do me\nthe great favor to

letter--\"\n\n\"_Caramba_, but I will see him myself!\"shouted the lightheaded\nRicardo.\"_Bien,\nenamorada_, is this the paramour whom you hid in your room last night?_Caramba_, you might have chosen a handsomer one!\"Ana sank down with a moan and buried her face in her hands.Diego\nheavily descended the stairs.\"I do not know, Padre,\" cried the man excitedly.\"Senorita Ana, she\nmade me drunk last night.I brought the girl--I waited for you, but\nthe senorita--\"\n\n\"_Caramba_, I understand!\"Ana had risen and was making for the stairs.Diego sprang to her and\nseized her by the wrist.With her free hand she drew the stiletto from\nher bosom and raised it to strike.Ricardo saw the movement, and threw\nhimself upon her.cried Diego, as Ricardo felled the woman and wrenched the\nweapon from her grasp.\"My pretty angel, you have the venom of a\nserpent!<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.did you think to deceive your doting Padre?But--_Dios nos guarde_!\"Carmen, awakened by the noise, had left her bed, and now stood at the\nhead of the stairs, looking with dilated eyes at the strange scene\nbeing enacted below.Ana lay on the ground, her eyes strained\ntoward the girl.Ricardo bent over her, awaiting his master's command.He knew now that she had forever lost her power over the priest.Diego\nstood like a statue, his eyes riveted upon Carmen.The girl looked\ndown upon them from the floor above with an expression of wonder, yet\nwithout fear.Diego was the first to find his voice.Wait for me, _hermosissima_!\"screamed Ana in a\nvoice of horror.Ricardo clapped his hand heavily over her mouth.he panted, feasting his eyes upon her, while a thrill\npassed through his coarse frame.\"_Madre de Dios_, but you have grown\nbeautiful!Don Mario was right--you are surely the most voluptuous\nobject in human form that has ever crossed my path._Bien_, the\nblessed God is still good to his little Diego!\"He started away with her, but was detained by the loud voice of\nRicardo.But--a\nfather's joy--ah!_Bien_, come to me to-morrow--\"\n\n\"_Na, Senor Padre_, but to-day--now!I have risked my life--and I have\na wife and babes!\"_Caramba_, ugly beast, but I will consign you to hell!There are more convenient seasons than this for your\nbusiness!\"And, still holding tightly to the girl's hand, he led her\ninto the study.The woman turned upon Ricardo with the fury of a tiger.\"This will cost your life, for you have\nput into his dirty hands the soul of an angel, and he will damn it!If you had only taken the money I brought you--\"\n\n\"Demon-tongue, I will take it now!\"He snatched the roll of bills from\nher hand and bolted through the door.With a low moan the woman sank\nto the ground, while oblivion drew its sable veil across her mind.Reaching the study, Diego pushed Carmen into the room and then\nfollowed, closing the door after him and throwing the iron bolt.Turning about, he stood with arms akimbo upon his bulging hips and\ngazed long and admiringly at the girl as she waited in expectant\nwonder before him.A smile of satisfaction and triumph slowly spread\nover his coarse features.Then it faded, and his heavy jowls and deep\nfurrows formed into an expression, sinister and ominous, through which\nlewdness, debauchery, and utter corruption looked out brazenly,\ndefiantly, into the fair, open countenance of the young girl before\nhim.A sense of weariness and dull pain then seemed to follow.He\nshook his heavy head and passed a hand across his brow, as if to brush\naside the confusion left by the previous night's potations.he muttered, falling heavily into a chair, \"but had\nI known you were here, little rosebud, I should have tried to keep\nsober.\"He reached out to grasp her; but she eluded him and went\nquickly to the open window, where she stood looking down into the\nstreet below.The morning sunlight, streaming into the room, engulfed\nher in its golden flood and transmuted the child of earth into a\ncreature divinely radiant, despite the torn gown and stains of river\ntravel.\"_Bien, carisima_,\" the man wheedled in a small, caressing voice,\n\"where is your greeting to your glad padre?he muttered,\nhis eyes roving over her full figure, \"but the Virgin herself was\nnever more lovely!Come, daughter,\" he purred, extending his arms;\n\"come to a father's heart that now, praise the Saints!shall ache no\nmore for its lost darling.\"The girl faced about and looked at him for a few moments.What her\nglance conveyed, the man was utterly incapable of understanding.Then\nshe drew up a chair that stood near the window, and sinking into it,\nburied her face in her hands.\"_Caramba_, my smile of heaven!chirped Diego,\naffecting surprise.\"Is it thus you celebrate your homecoming?Or are\nthese, perchance, fitting tears of joy?_Bien_, your padre's doting\nheart itself weeps that its years of loneliness are at last ended.\"He\nheld the sleeve of his gown to his eyes and sniffed affectedly.\"I was just knowing,\" she answered slowly, \"that I was not afraid--that\nGod was everywhere, even right here--and that He would not let any\nharm come to me.\"and you ask Him to protect you from your adoring father!He again held\nout his arms to her.\"I am not afraid--now,\" she answered softly.\"But--I do not think God\nwill let me come to you.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.If you were really my father, He would.\"The man's mouth gaped in astonishment.A fleeting sense of shame\nswept through his festering mind.Then the lustful meanness of his\ncorrupted soul welled up anew, and he laughed brutally.The idea\nwas delightfully novel; the girl beautifully audacious; the situation\npiquantly amusing.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.He would draw her out to his further enjoyment.\"So,\" he observed parenthetically, \"I judge you are on quite familiar\nterms with God, eh?\"The joke was excellent, and he roared with mirth.he\ncommented, reaching over and uncorking with shaking hand the bottle\nthat stood on the table.Then, filling a glass, \"Suppose you thank Him\nfor sending his little Diego this estimable wine and your own charming\nself, eh?Whereat he guffawed loudly and\nslapped his bulging sides.The girl had already bowed her head again in her hands.Diego's beady eyes devoured the beautiful creature before him.\"_Bien_, little Passion flower,\" he\ninterrupted, \"if you have conveyed to Him my infinite gratitude,\nperhaps He will now let you come to me, eh?\"\"I have thanked\nHim, Padre--for you and for me,\" she said; \"for you, that you really\nare His child, even if you don't know it; and for me that I know He\nalways hears me.That was what the good man Jesus said, you know, when\nhe waked Lazarus out of the

on\nquietly:\n\n\"I was not afraid on the river, Padre.And I was not afraid to come in\nhere with you.I knew, just as the good man Jesus did at the tomb of\nLazarus, that God had heard me--He just

I know you don't come from God; and anything\nthat doesn't come from God isn't really anything at all!'The good man Jesus knew, didn't he?That's why he\nsaid so often, 'Be not afraid.'\"Her big eyes sparkled, and her\nface glowed with celestial light.Diego raised a heavy arm and,\ngroping for the bottle, eagerly drained another glass of wine.\"You think that wine makes you happy, don't you, Padre?\"she observed,\nwatching him gulp down the heavy liquor.It just\ngives you what Padre Jose calls a false sense of happiness.And when\nthat false sense passes away--for everything unreal has just _got_ to\npass away--why, then you are more unhappy than you were before.he\nejaculated, \"will you rein that runaway tongue!\"\"No, Padre,\" she replied evenly, \"for it is God who is talking to you.You ought to, for you are a priest.You ought to\nknow Him as well as the good man Jesus did.Padre, can you lay your\nhands on the sick babies and cure them?\"The man squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, and then broke into\nanother brutal laugh.but we find it easier\nto raise new babies than to cure sick ones!do _hadas_ have such voluptuous bodies, such plump legs!_Madre de Dios_, girl, enough of your preaching!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.\"No, Padre,\" she answered quietly, \"I do not want to come to you.But\nI want to talk to you--\"\n\n\"_Dios y diablo_!with a Venus before\nme do you think I yearn for a sermon?delay it, delay it--\"\n\n\"Padre,\" she interrupted, \"you do not see _me._ You are looking only\nat your bad thoughts of me.\"His laugh resembled the snort of an animal.\"Yes, Padre--and they are _very_ bad thoughts, too--they don't come\nfrom God, and you are _so_ foolish to let them use you the way you do.And you know you see around\nyou only the thoughts that you have been thinking.Why don't you think\ngood thoughts, and so see only good things?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.\"Can it be\nthat I don't see a plump little witch before me, but only my bad\nthoughts, eh?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple._Bien_, then,\" he\ncoaxed, \"come to your poor, deluded padre and let him learn that you\nare only a thing of thought, and not the most enchanting little piece\nof flesh that ever caused a Saint to fall!\"Her smile had fled, and in its place\nsadness and pity were written large upon her wistful face.\"Come, my little bundle of thought,\" he coaxed, holding out his fat,\nhairy arms.\"No, Padre,\" the girl answered firmly.\"_Na_, then, still afraid, eh?\"\"No, Padre;

\"for God is mind, you know.And\nHis thought is the only real thought there is or can be.The thoughts\nof mortals are the opposites of His thoughts, and so they are\nillusions, and, like all lies, must pass away.If people want to be\nimmortal, they must think as God thinks, for He is immortal.They must\nstop thinking that there is any power but God.They must stop letting\nin thoughts of sickness, of sin, of wickedness, and all those things\nthat in English you call 'discord.'God says in the Bible, 'As the\nheavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts higher than your\nthoughts.'And if we want to be\nlike Him we must think His thoughts.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"I see, _chiquita_--sometimes very clearly--and\nthen again I don't see,\" he said slowly.she insisted, getting up on her knees and facing him.And if you hold this thought always, why, it\nwill--it will be--\"\n\n\"Externalized;

and the other is the human mind's\ninterpretation of the creation--an interpretation made according to\nthe way the human mind thinks the creating _ought_ to have been in\nmatter?And the second chapter shows how\nfar the human mind can go--it shows how limited it is.The human mind\ncouldn't get any farther than that--couldn't make a man out of\nanything but dirt.And\nso it made a creation of its own.It couldn't understand God; and so\nit made a Lord God, just like itself.And if you see, can't you _stick_ to it and _live_ it, until all\nthe unreal passes away?\"\"I will never cease to try,\n_chiquita_,\" he said.\"But we were talking about loving Diego, weren't\nwe?Yes, you are right, we must try to love him, for the good Jesus\nsaid we must love our enemies.\"\"But, if we love everybody, then we haven't any enemies.You can't\nlove a real enemy--and so there aren't any real ones.We see in other\npeople only what is in our own thought.If we see evil as real, why,\nthen we will see bad men and women all around us, for we only look at\nour thoughts.But, if we look only at God's thoughts--Padre dear, I\ndidn't see anything but God's thought when Padre Diego had me in his\narms.I knew it wasn't real, but was just the human way of looking at\nthings.And I knew that love was the great principle of everything,\nand that it just couldn't fail, any more than the principle of algebra\ncould fail to solve my problems.Well,\" she concluded with a little\nsigh, \"it didn't.\"\"Dear little girl, you must be patient, very patient, with your\nblundering old Padre Jose.He is groping for the light--\"\n\nIn an instant, throwing the canoe into imminent danger of upsetting,\nthe impulsive girl had hurled herself into his lap and clasped her\narms about his neck.Juan and Lazaro by a quick and skillful effort\nkept the craft upright.she cried, \"I didn't mean to say a word that would\nmake you unhappy--Padre dear, I love you so!Padre, look at your\nlittle girl, and tell her that you love her!\"he murmured, \"I--I must\nnot--and--yet--_chiquita_--I adore you!\"He buried his face in her\nshoulder.Juan made a wry mouth as he looked at the girl in the priest's arms.Then he suggested that a separation would more evenly balance the\nboat.Carmen laughed up at him, but slipped down into the keel and sat\nwith her head propped against Jose's knees.\"Padre dear,\" she said, looking up at him with twinkling eyes, \"I\nheard Lazaro say a little while before we started that he had lived\nmany years in Simiti, and that it had always been very quiet until you\ncame.\"\"I can readily believe that the whole world\nwas quiet until I entered it.\"\"But, Padre, perhaps you had to come into it to shake it up.\"\"_Chiquita_,\" he said, \"if ever you go out into it, with\nyour radical views regarding God and man;

and Juan and Lazaro, catching the\ninspiration, broke into a weird, uncanny boating song, such as is\nheard only among these simple folk.As they neared the town the song\nof the _bogas_ changed into a series of loud, yodelling halloos; and\nwhen the canoe grated upon the shaly beach, Dona Maria and a score of\nothers were there to welcome the returned travelers.At the sight of Ana, a murmur ran through the crowd.\"It is Anita, madre dear,\" Carmen quickly announced, as she struggled\nout of Dona Maria's arms and took the confused Ana by the hand.The light of recognition came into Dona Maria's eyes.Quietly, and\nwithout demonstration, she went to the shrinking woman and, taking the\ntear-stained face in her hands, impressed a kiss upon each cheek.\"_Bien_,\" she said in a low, tender voice, \"we have waited long for\nyou, daughter.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe glow of dawn had scarce begun to creep timidly across the arch of\nheaven when Fernando knocked at the portal of Rosendo's house and\ndemanded the custody of Carmen.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.\"And now, Fernando,\" demanded the priest, \"what new outrage is this?\"\"_Na_, Padre, a thousand\npardons--but it is the order of the Alcalde, and I only obey.But--you\nmay knock me down,\" he added eagerly, \"and then I can return to him\nand say that I could not take the girl, even by force!\"The honest\nfellow, ashamed of his mission, hung his head.he cried, \"what say the people of Simiti?\"They would demand Rosendo's release, if\nthere were proof that the girl--\"\n\n\"Good, then!The Alcalde, you know,\npermits no one to approach the prisoner.\"\"The guard did not tell him, for fear of exciting the old man._Hombre!_ I think there is no one in town who would venture to tell\nRosendo that.\"\"_Bien pues_, Fernando, I think the time has come!Go quietly back and\nsummon every one to a meeting in the town hall at once.Tell them--\"\n\n\"_Bien_, Padre, I shall know what to tell them.But,\" anxiously, \"Don\nMario has the power to--\"\n\n\"And we have a greater power,\" quickly replied the priest, his thought\ndwelling on Carmen.An hour later the town hall was a babel of clacking tongues.Men,\nwomen and children hurried, chattering, to and fro, exchanging diverse\nviews and speculating eagerly on the probable outcome of the meeting.Jose stood before them, with Carmen's hand clasped tightly in his.Don\nMario, purple and trembling with rage, was perched upon a chair,\nvainly trying to get the ear of the people.In the midst of the hubbub a hush fell suddenly over the concourse.All heads turned, and all eyes fastened upon Ana, as she entered the\nroom and moved timidly toward Jose.The people fell back to make a\npassage for her.Her shoulders were bent, and her face was covered\nwith a black _mantilla_.Don Mario, as his glance fell upon her, again attempted to address the\nmultitude.A strong arm from behind\npushed him from the chair.His craven heart began to quake, and he\ncast anxious glances toward the single exit.Gently removing the _mantilla_ from the face of the woman, Jose turned\nher toward the people.he said in a loud, penetrating\nvoice, \"behold the work of Diego!\"<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.He paused for the effect which he knew would be made upon this\nimpressionable people.Then, when the loud murmur had passed, he drew\nCarmen out before him and, pointing to her, said dramatically, \"And\nshall we also throw this innocent child to the wolf?\"Fists were shaken under the Alcalde's\nnose, and imprecations were hurled at him from all sides.Don Mario\ndrew his soiled handkerchief and mopped his steaming brow.Then his\nvoice broke out in a shriek: \"The soldiers--this day I shall summon\nthem--it is a riot!\"\"_Caramba!_ He speaks truth!\"_Caramba!_ Let Diego have his child!\"\"_\n\n\"Who says it is not his?\"Clasping Jose's arm to steady herself, she had turned to\nconfront the excited assembly.Then:\n\n\"The priest Diego had a child--a girl.\"I did not know how to announce this terrible news to the King,\" he\nsays; \"but time was pressing, and he had forbidden my concealing anything\nfrom him.In the evening, while undressing him, I gave him an account of\nall I had learnt, and added that there were only four days to concert some\nplan of corresponding with the Queen.The arrival of the municipal\nofficer would not allow me to say more.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.Next morning, when the King rose,\nI could not get a moment for speaking with him.He went up with his son\nto breakfast with the Princesses, and I followed.After breakfast he\ntalked long with the Queen, who, by a look full of trouble, made me\nunderstand that they were discussing what I had told the King.During the", "question": "Where is the football?

the muster-roll of the National Guard was called\nover every hour; a picket of two hundred men watched in the court of each\nof the right sections; a reserve with cannon was stationed at the\nTuileries, and strong detachments patroled the streets and cleared the\nroad of all loiterers.The trees that lined the boulevards, the doors and\nwindows of the houses, were alive with gazers, and all eyes were fixed on\nthe King.He was much changed since his people last beheld him.The beard\nhe had been compelled to grow after his razors were taken from him covered\ncheeks, lips, and chin with light-coloured hair, which concealed the\nmelancholy expression of his mouth; he had become thin, and his garments\nhung loosely on him; but his manner was perfectly collected and calm, and\nhe recognised and named to the Mayor the various quarters through which he\npassed.On arriving at the Feuillans he was taken to a room to await the\norders of the Assembly.It was about half-past two when the King appeared at the bar.The Mayor\nand Generaux Santerre and Wittengoff were at his side.Profound silence\npervaded the Assembly.All were touched by the King's dignity and the\ncomposure of his looks under so great a reverse of fortune.By nature he\nhad been formed rather to endure calamity with patience than to contend\nagainst it with energy.The approach of death could not disturb his\nserenity.\"Louis, you may be seated,\" said Barere.\"Answer the questions that shall\nbe put to you.\"The King seated himself and listened to the reading of\nthe 'acte enonciatif', article by article.All the faults of the Court\nwere there enumerated and imputed to Louis XVI.He was charged\nwith the interruption of the sittings of the 20th of June, 1789, with the\nBed of Justice held on the 23d of the same month, the aristocratic\nconspiracy thwarted by the insurrection of the 14th of July, the\nentertainment of the Life Guards, the insults offered to the national\ncockade, the refusal to sanction the Declaration of Rights, as well as\nseveral constitutional articles; lastly, all the facts which indicated a\nnew conspiracy in October, and which were followed by the scenes of the\n5th and 6th; the speeches of reconciliation which had succeeded all these\nscenes, and which promised a change that was not sincere; the false oath\ntaken at the Federation of the 14th of July; the secret practices of Talon\nand Mirabeau to effect a counter-revolution; the money spent in bribing a\ngreat number of deputies; the assemblage of the \"knights of the dagger\" on\nthe 28th of February, 1791; the flight to Varennes; the fusilade of the\nChamp de Mars; the silence observed respecting the Treaty of Pilnitz; the\ndelay in the promulgation of the decree which incorporated Avignon with\nFrance; the commotions at Nimes, Montauban, Mende, and Jales; the\ncontinuance of their pay to the emigrant Life Guards and to the disbanded\nConstitutional Guard; the insufficiency of the armies assembled on the\nfrontiers; the refusal to sanction the decree for the camp of twenty\nthousand men; the disarming of the fortresses; the organisation of secret\nsocieties in the interior of Paris; the review of the Swiss and the\ngarrison of the palace on the 10th August; the summoning the Mayor to the\nTuileries; and lastly, the effusion of blood which had resulted from these\nmilitary dispositions.After each article the President paused, and said,\n\"What have you to answer?\"The King, in a firm voice, denied some of the\nfacts, imputed others to his ministers, and always appealed to the\nconstitution, from which he declared he had never deviated.His answers\nwere very temperate, but on the charge, \"You spilt the blood of the people\non the 10th of August,\" he exclaimed, with emphasis, \"No, monsieur, no;

and he, being allowed\nwriting materials while preparing his defence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a\nshort note.An answer was conveyed in a ball of cotton, which Turgi threw\nunder Clery's bed while passing the door of his room.Letters were also\npassed between the Princess's room and that of Clery, who lodged beneath\nher, by means of a string let down and drawn up at night.This\ncommunication with his family was a great comfort to the King, who,\nnevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful servant.\"Take care,\" he\nwould say kindly, \"you expose yourself too much.\"[The King's natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the Temple.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.His own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy with the\nsmaller troubles of others.A servant in the Temple named Marchand, the\nfather of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs, --his wages for two\nmonths.The King observed his distress, asked its cause, and gave Clery\nthe amount to be handed to Marchand, with a caution not to speak of it to\nany one, and, above all, not to thank the King, lest it should injure him\nwith his employers.]During his separation from his family the King refused to go into the\ngarden.When it was proposed to him he said, \"I cannot make up my mind to\ngo out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with my\nfamily.\"But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful reflections.He talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised them by his\nvaried and practical knowledge of their trades, and his interest in their\ndomestic affairs.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.On the 19th December the King's breakfast was served as\nusual;

the King ordered Clery to buy her the\n\"Almanac of the Republic,\" which had replaced the \"Court Almanac,\" and ran\nthrough it, marking with a pencil many names.\"On Christmas Day,\" Says Clery, \"the King wrote his will.\"[Madame Royale says: \"On the 26th December, St.Stephen's Day, my father\nmade his will, because he expected to be assassinated that day on his way\nto the bar of the Convention.He went thither, nevertheless, with his\nusual calmness.\"On the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the\nConvention.M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his\ndefence.The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too\nrhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.[When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King, the\nevening before it was delivered to the Assembly, \"I have to request of\nyou,\" he said, \"to make a painful sacrifice;

he\nseated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure\nthe benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine their\nfaces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the pleading\nof M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with Tronchet and\nMalesherbes.The Assembly received his defence in sullen silence, but\nwithout any tokens of disapprobation.Being afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the King\nshowed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the long\ndefence.While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his companions\nwith the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.No sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent\ntumult arose there.Others,\ncomplaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,\ndemanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the\naccused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.Lanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an\nindignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to\nrepress.He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his\npresence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether.He\nexclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the Assembly\nought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment on Louis\nXVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the Assembly in\nparticular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as a political\nbody, it could do no more than take measures of safety against the\nci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of justice it was\noverstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the vanquished to be\ntried by the conquerors, since most of the present members had declared\nthemselves the conspirators of the 10th of August.At the word\n\"conspirators\" a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.Lanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word \"conspirators,\" saying that\nhe meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of August\nwas a glorious conspiracy.He concluded by declaring that he would rather\ndie a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws, even the most\nexecrable of tyrants.A great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually\nincreased.The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled\ntogether, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.After a\ntempest of an hour's duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the\nAssembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on the\ntrial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should be\ncontinued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence should be\npassed.The discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a\nconstant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.Vergniaud at\nlength ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary\neagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments\nby the lips of their greatest orator.The speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.Robespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.Vergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which\nwavered between the two parties.Several members were successively heard,\nfor and against the appeal to the people.Brissot, Gensonne, Petion,\nsupported it in their turn.One speaker at length had a decisive\ninfluence on the question.Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and\nevasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.He spoke at\ngreat length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings--of facts, of\nlaws, and of policy--and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted\nspecious reasons for yielding, with motives for the condemnation of the\nKing.The\ndiscussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the\ncontinual repetition of the same facts and arguments.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.It was therefore\ndeclared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh\nadjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a\ndecree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the\nvote.Meantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his\noutward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.On the\nmorning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the\ncommissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen a\ncopy of the King's printed defence, asked for something which had belonged\nto him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck handkerchief\nand gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another municipal, who had made\nthe same request.\"On January 1st,\" says Clery, \"I approached the King's\nbed and asked permission to offer him my warmest prayers for the end of\nhis misfortunes.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.'I accept your good wishes with affection,' he replied,\nextending his hand to me.As soon as he had risen, he requested a\nmunicipal to go and inquire for his family, and present them his good\nwishes for the new year.The officers were moved by the tone in which\nthese words, so heartrending considering the position of the King, were\npronounced.The correspondence between their Majesties went on\nconstantly.The King being informed that Madame Royale was ill, was very\nuneasy for some days.The Queen, after begging earnestly, obtained\npermission for M. Brunnier, the medical attendant of the royal children,\nto come to the Temple.The nearer the moment which was to decide the King's fate approached, the\ngreater became the agitation in, Paris.\"A report was circulated that the\natrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners and\ntheir relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would\nsnatch them from destruction.The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that\nconspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.from\npunishment, and to restore royalty.Their anger, excited by delays and\nobstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus\nalarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs.\"On the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,\nbeing the final judgment of Louis XVI.\"The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial,\" says Hazlitt,\n\"lasted seventy-two hours.It might naturally be supposed that silence,\nrestraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.On the\ncontrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the most\ngrotesque confusion.The farther end of the hall was converted into\nboxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,\nliqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,\nas on ordinary occasions.Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side\nopened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc\nd'Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation\nwas strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant 'Ha, ha's!'of\nthe mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,\nwhenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of\ndeath.The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole\ntrial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as\nin a tavern.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.\"Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring\ncoffee-houses.Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every\ncountenance.The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by\nthe pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only the\nword--Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to dinner\nbefore they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in order to\ncount the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only waking up to\ngive their sentence,--all this had the appearance rather of a hideous\ndream than of a reality.\"The Duc d'Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his\nKing and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than\ndeath itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:\n\"Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have\nresisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for\ndeath!\"Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was\nto the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously\nselfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the\nagitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single\nvote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.The President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny was\nproclaimed as follows\n\n\n     Against an appeal to the people........... 480\n     For an appeal to the people............... 283\n\n     Majority for final judgment............... 197\n\n\nThe President having announced that he was about to declare the result of\nthe scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the following\ndeclaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319 were for\nimprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment, eight for a\nsuspension of the execution of the sentence of death until after the\nexpulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for not putting\nhim to death until the French territory was invaded by any foreign power,\nand one was for a sentence of death, but with power of commutation of the\npunishment.After this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his\nvoice, said: \"In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that\nthe punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet\nis DEATH!\"Previous to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the\npart of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish\nMinister relative to that sentence.The Convention, however, refused to\nhear it.[It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was forwarded\nby the English Government.]M. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the\nTemple at nine o'clock on the morning of the 17th?.During the calling of the votes\nhe asked M. de Malesherbes, \"Have you not met near the Temple the White\nLady?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.\"Do you not know,\" resumed the\nKing with a smile, \"that when a prince of our house is about to die, a\nfemale dressed in white is seen wandering about the palace?My friends,\"\nadded he to his defenders, \"I am about to depart before you for the land\nof the just, but there, at least, we shall be reunited.\"In fact, his\nMajesty's only apprehension seemed to be for his family.--ALISON.]\"All is lost,\" he said to Clery.The King, who\nsaw him arrive, rose to receive him.[When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of the\nvote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and absorbed\nin a deep reverie.Without inquiring concerning his fate, he said: \"For\ntwo hours I have been considering whether, during my whole reign, I have\nvoluntarily given any cause of complaint to my subjects; and with perfect\nsincerity I declare that I deserve no reproach at their hands, and that I\nhave never formed a wish but for their happiness.\"M. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.The King\nraised him up and affectionately embraced him.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.When he could control his\nvoice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to\ndeath; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only\naffected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.On the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI.was awaiting\nhis advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.He stopped\nwith dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved: Garat then\ntold him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate to him the\ndecrees of the Convention.Grouvelle, secretary of the Executive Council,\nread them to him.guilty of treason against\nthe general safety of the State; the second condemned him to death; the\nthird rejected any appeal to the people; and the fourth and last ordered\nhis execution in twenty-four hours.Louis, looking calmly round, took the\npaper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a letter, in which he demanded from\nthe Convention three days to prepare for death, a confessor to assist him\nin his last moments, liberty to see his family, and permission for them to\nleave France.Garat took the letter, promising to submit it immediately\nto the Convention.then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his\ndinner, and ate as usual.There were no knives on the table, and his\nattendants refused to let him have any.\"Do they think me so cowardly,\"\nhe exclaimed, \"as to lay violent hands on myself?<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.I am innocent, and I am\nnot afraid to die.\"The Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he\nhad made.Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom\nLouis XVI.had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple.M.\nEdgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have\nthrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed\ntears of emotion.He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions\nconcerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the\nArchbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died\nfaithfully attached to his communion.--The clock having struck eight, he\nrose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that\nhe was going to see his family.The municipal officers, unwilling to lose\nsight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he should\nsee them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which they\ncould watch all his<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.", "question": "Where is the milk?

Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview.The\nKing retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon a\nbed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.Next morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,\nand dressed with great calmness.He congratulated himself on having\nrecovered his strength by sleep.Clery kindled a fire,, and moved a chest\nof drawers, out of which he formed an altar.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.M.

Edgeworth occupied the back.During the ride, which was\nrather long, the King read in M. Edgeworth's breviary the prayers for\npersons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his\npiety and tranquil resignation.The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst\nuniversal silence.At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had\nbeen left vacant about the scaffold.Around this space were planted\ncannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the\nscaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and\nmisfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks\nof the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of\nsatisfaction.Louis XVI., rising briskly,\nstepped out into the Place.Three executioners came up; he refused their\nassistance, and took off his clothes himself.But, perceiving that they\nwere going to bind his hands, he made a movement of indignation, and\nseemed ready to resist.M. Edgeworth gave him a last look, and said,\n\"Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God who is about to be\nyour reward.\"At these words the King suffered himself to be bound and\nconducted to the scaffold.All at once Louis hurriedly advanced to\naddress the people.\"Frenchmen,\" said he, in a firm voice, \"I die\ninnocent of the crimes which are imputed to me;

She threw herself,\ndressed as she was, on her own bed, where we heard her shivering with cold\nand grief all night long.At a quarter-past six the door opened; we\nbelieved that we were sent for to the King, but it was only the officers\nlooking for a prayer-book for him.We did not, however, abandon the hope\nof seeing him, till shouts of joy from the infuriated populace told us\nthat all was over.In the afternoon my mother asked to see Clery, who\nprobably had some message for her; we hoped that seeing him would occasion\na burst of grief which might relieve the state of silent and choking agony\nin which we saw her.\"The request was refused, and the officers who\nbrought the refusal said Clery was in \"a frightful state of despair\" at\nnot being allowed to see the royal family; shortly afterwards he was\ndismissed from the Temple.\"We had now a little more freedom,\" continues the Princess; \"our guards\neven believed that we were about to be sent out of France; but nothing\ncould calm my mother's agony; no hope could touch her heart, and life or\ndeath became indifferent to her.Fortunately my own affliction increased\nmy illness so seriously that it distracted her thoughts.My\nmother would go no more to the garden, because she must have passed the\ndoor of what had been my father's room, and that she could not bear.But\nfearing lest want of air should prove injurious to my brother and me,\nabout the end of February she asked permission to walk on the leads of the\nTower, and it was granted.\"The Council of the Commune, becoming aware of the interest which these sad\npromenades excited, and the sympathy with which they were observed from\nthe neighbouring houses, ordered that the spaces between the battlements\nshould be filled up with shutters, which intercepted the view.But while\nthe rules for the Queen's captivity were again made more strict, some of\nthe municipal commissioners tried slightly to alleviate it, and by means\nof M. de Hue, who was at liberty in Paris, and the faithful Turgi, who\nremained in the Tower, some communications passed between the royal family\nand their friends.The wife of Tison, who waited on the Queen, suspected\nand finally denounced these more lenient guardians,--[Toulan, Lepitre,\nVincent, Bruno, and others.]--who were executed, the royal prisoners being\nsubjected to a close examination.\"On the 20th of April,\" says Madame Royale, \"my mother and I had just gone\nto bed when Hebert arrived with several municipals.We got up hastily,\nand these men read us a decree of the Commune directing that we should be\nsearched.My poor brother was asleep; they tore him from his bed under\nthe pretext of examining it.My mother took him up, shivering with cold.All they took was a shopkeeper's card which my mother had happened to\nkeep, a stick of sealing-wax from my aunt, and from me 'une sacre coeur de\nJesus' and a prayer for the welfare of France.The search lasted from\nhalf-past ten at night till four o'clock in the morning.\"The next visit of the officials was to Madame Elisabeth alone; they found\nin her room a hat which the King had worn during his imprisonment, and\nwhich she had begged him to give her as a souvenir.They took it from her\nin spite of her entreaties.\"It was suspicious,\" said the cruel and\ncontemptible tyrants.The Dauphin became ill with fever, and it was long before his mother, who\nwatched by him night and day, could obtain medicine or advice for him.When Thierry was at last allowed to see him his treatment relieved the\nmost violent symptoms, but, says Madame Royale, \"his health was never\nreestablished.Want of air and exercise did him great mischief, as well\nas the kind of life which this poor child led, who at eight years of age\npassed his days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant anxiety\nand agony.\"While the Dauphin's health was causing his family such alarm, they were\ndeprived of the services of Tison's wife, who became ill, and finally\ninsane, and was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where her ravings were reported\nto the Assembly and made the ground of accusations against the royal\nprisoners.[This woman, troubled by remorse, lost her reason, threw herself at the\nfeet of the Queen, implored her pardon, and disturbed the Temple for many\ndays with the sight and the noise of her madness.The Princesses,\nforgetting the denunciations of this unfortunate being, in consideration\nof her repentance and insanity, watched over her by turns, and deprived\nthemselves of their own food to relieve her.--LAMARTINE, \"History of the\nGirondists,\" vol.No woman took her place, and the Princesses themselves made their beds,\nswept their rooms, and waited upon the Queen.Far worse punishments than menial work were prepared for them.On 3d July\na decree of the Convention ordered that the Dauphin should be separated\nfrom his family and \"placed in the most secure apartment of the Tower.\"As soon as he heard this decree pronounced, says his sister, \"he threw\nhimself into my mother's arms, and with violent cries entreated not to be\nparted from her.My mother would not let her son go, and she actually\ndefended against the efforts of the officers the bed in which she had\nplaced him.The men threatened to call up the guard and use violence.My\nmother exclaimed that they had better kill her than tear her child from\nher.At last they threatened our lives, and my mother's maternal\ntenderness forced her to the sacrifice.My aunt and I dressed the child,\nfor my poor mother had no longer strength for anything.Nevertheless, when\nhe was dressed, she took him up in her arms and delivered him herself to\nthe officers, bathing him with her tears, foreseeing that she was never to\nbehold him again.The poor little fellow embraced us all tenderly, and\nwas carried away in a flood of tears.My mother's horror was extreme when\nshe heard that Simon, a shoemaker by trade, whom she had seen as a\nmunicipal officer in the Temple, was the person to whom her child was\nconfided.The officers now no longer remained in my mother's\napartment; they only came three times a day to bring our meals and examine\nthe bolts and bars of our windows; we were locked up together night and\nday.We often went up to the Tower, because my brother went, too, from\nthe other side.The only pleasure my mother enjoyed was seeing him\nthrough a crevice as he passed at a distance.She would watch for hours\ntogether to see him as he passed.It was her only hope, her only\nthought.\"The Queen was soon deprived even of this melancholy consolation.On 1st\nAugust, 1793, it was resolved that she should be tried.Robespierre\nopposed the measure, but Barere roused into action that deep-rooted hatred\nof the Queen which not even the sacrifice of her life availed to\neradicate.\"Why do the enemies of the Republic still hope for success?\"\"Is it because we have too long forgotten the crimes of the\nAustrian?The children of Louis the Conspirator are hostages for the\nRepublic..but behind them lurks a woman who has been the cause of\nall the disasters of France.\"At two o'clock on the morning of the following day, the municipal officers\n\"awoke us,\" says Madame Royale, \"to read to my mother the decree of the\nConvention, which ordered her removal to the Conciergerie,\n\n[The Conciergerie was originally, as its name implies, the porter's lodge\nof the ancient Palace of Justice, and became in time a prison, from the\ncustom of confining there persons who had committed trifling offences\nabout the Court.]She heard it without visible emotion, and\nwithout speaking a single word.My aunt and I immediately asked to be\nallowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.All the\ntime my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these\nofficers never left her.She was even obliged to dress herself before\nthem, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they\ncontained.She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my\ncourage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.She then threw herself into my aunt's arms, and recommended her children\nto her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then hurried\naway.In leaving the Temple she struck her head against the wicket, not\nhaving stooped low enough.[Mathieu, the gaoler, used to say, \"I make Madame Veto and her sister and\ndaughter, proud though they are, salute me; for the door is so low they\ncannot pass without bowing.\"]'No,' she replied,\n'nothing can hurt me now.\"We have already seen what changes had been made in the Temple.Marie\nAntoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,\nby virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last\nmembers of the family of the Bourbons.She had been removed to the\nConciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to what\nwas strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.The imprudence of a\ndevoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome.Michonnis, a\nmember of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm interest, was\ndesirous of introducing to her a person who, he said, wished to see her\nout of curiosity.This man, a courageous emigrant, threw to her a\ncarnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper with these\nwords: \"Your friends are ready,\"--false hope, and equally dangerous for\nher who received it, and for him who gave it!Michonnis and the emigrant\nwere detected and forthwith apprehended; and the vigilance exercised in\nregard to the unfortunate prisoner became from that day more rigorous than\never.[The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which was\nconsidered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie on\naccount of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was continually\naffected.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Under pretence of giving her a person to wait upon her they\nplaced near her a spy,--a man of a horrible countenance and hollow,\nsepulchral voice.This wretch, whose name was Barassin, was a robber and\nmurderer by profession.Such was the chosen attendant on the Queen of\nFrance!A few days before her trial this wretch was removed and a\ngendarme placed in her chamber, who watched over her night and day, and\nfrom whom she was not separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged\ncurtain.In this melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress\nthan an old black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend\nevery day;

and he had caused a resolution to be passed by\nwhich the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were\nmaintained was to be suppressed.They were no longer to be allowed either\npoultry or pastry;

and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his being\nbrought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the infamous\nparticulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her\njudges.Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable\nrevolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of\nacquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had\nbrought her before it.It was necessary, however, to make some charges.Fouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever\nsince the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of\naccusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for\nher pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,\nthe Emperor.He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October, and\non the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that period\nframed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to frustrate\nit.He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband, interfered\nin the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the deputies\ngained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked the war,\nand transmitted to the enemy's generals all our plans of campaign.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the apple there.He\nfurther accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on the 10th of\nAugust, of having on that day caused the people to be fired upon, having\ninduced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with cowardice;\nlastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with foreigners\nsince her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated her young\nson as King.We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-deferred\nvengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such of their\nprinces as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted and\nconverted into crime.We see how the profusion and fondness for pleasure,\nso natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her native country,\nher influence over her husband, her regrets, always more indiscreet in a\nwoman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared to their inflamed\nor malignant imaginations.Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,\nwho had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who\nhad frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial\noffices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..\nAdmiral d'Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles; Manuel,\nthe ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war in 1789;\nthe venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La Fayette, an\naccomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of the\nGirondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons and\ncompelled to give evidence.Some had seen the Queen in high spirits\nwhen the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her vexed\nand dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from\nVarennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have\ncost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices\nthat the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.An ancient\nwaiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that\nthe Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make\nwar upon the Turks.The cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at\nlength to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.He said that\nCharles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and\nmentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.He then added\nthat this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for his age;\nthat he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him, learned that\nhe derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged.Hebert said\nthat it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by weakening thus,\nearly the physical constitution of her son, to secure to herself the means\nof ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne.The rumours which\nhad been whispered for twenty years by a malicious Court had given the\npeople a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of the Queen.That\naudience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted at the accusations\nof Hebert.[Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.Queen\nby Hdbert,--namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with her own\nson?He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted in order to\nprejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent her execution from\nexciting pity.It had, however, no other effect than that of disgusting\nall parties.--PRUDHOMME.][Hebert did not long survive her in whose sufferings he had taken such an\ninfamous part.He was executed on 26th March, 1794.]Urged a new to explain herself, she\nsaid, with extraordinary emotion, \"I thought that human nature would\nexcuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the\nheart of every mother here present.\"This noble and simple reply affected\nall who heard it.In the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for\nMarie Antoinette.The brave D'Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would\nnot say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which she\nhad shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution which\nshe had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly.Manuel, in\nspite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the Legislative\nAssembly, declared that he could not say anything against the accused.When the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so often\npredicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must produce,\nhe appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew the wife\nof Capet, \"Yes,\" said he, bowing respectfully, \"I have known Madame.\"He\ndeclared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the declarations\nextorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to Varennes were\nfalse.In recompense for his deposition he was assailed with outrageous\nreproaches, from which he might judge what fate would soon be awarded to\nhimself.In all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by\nLatour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help\nit.Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for\nan accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war.Valaze,\nalways cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say anything to\ncriminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that, as a member\nof the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his colleagues to\nexamine the papers found at the house of Septeuil, treasurer of the civil\nlist, he had seen bonds for various sums signed Antoinette, which was very\nnatural; but he added that he had also seen a letter in which the minister\nrequested the King to transmit to the Queen the copy of the plan of\ncampaign which he had in his hands.The most unfavourable construction\nwas immediately put upon these two facts, the application for a statement\nof the armies, and the communication of the plan of campaign; and it was\nconcluded that they could not be wanted for any other purpose than to be\nsent to the enemy, for it was not supposed that a young princess should\nturn her attention, merely for her own satisfaction, to matters of\nadministration and military, plans.After these depositions, several\nothers were received respecting the expenses of the Court, the influence\nof the Queen in public affairs, the scene of the 10th of August, and what\nhad passed in the Temple; and the most vague rumours and most trivial\ncircumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.Marie Antoinette frequently repeated, with presence of mind and firmness,\nthat there was no precise fact against her;\n\n[At first the Queen, consulting only her own sense of dignity, had\nresolved on her trial to make no other reply to the questions of her\njudges than \"Assassinate me as you have already assassinated my husband!\"Afterwards, however, she determined to follow the example of the King,\nexert herself in her defence, and leave her judges without any excuse or\npretest for putting her to death.--WEBER'S \"Memoirs of Marie Antoinette.\"]that, besides, though the wife of Louis XVI., she was not answerable for\nany of the acts of his reign.Fouquier nevertheless declared her to be\nsufficiently convicted; Chaveau-Lagarde made unavailing efforts to defend\nher; and the unfortunate Queen was condemned to suffer the same fate as\nher husband.Conveyed back to the Conciergerie, she there passed in tolerable composure\nthe night preceding her execution, and, on the morning of the following\nday, the 16th of October,\n\n[The Queen, after having written and prayed, slept soundly for some hours.On her waking, Bault's daughter dressed her and adjusted her hair with\nmore neatness than on other days.Marie Antoinette wore a white gown, a\nwhite handkerchief covered her shoulders, a white cap her hair;

\"if\nhe had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before\nyou!\"She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief.\"I am\nready to die,\" she said, \"happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better\nworld those whom I loved on earth.\"On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same\ntime as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and\nresignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and\ncourage like her own.The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace\nher, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted\nthe scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions\nhad been executed before her eyes.[Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at distant\nintervals during the course of ages; she set an example of steadfast piety\nin the palace of kings, she lived amid her family the favourite of all and\nthe admiration of the world....  When I went to Versailles Madame\nElisabeth was twenty-two years of age.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk there.Her plump figure and pretty pink\ncolour must have attracted notice, and her air of calmness and contentment\neven more than her beauty.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and\ncourage in riding were remarkable.But she never allowed these amusements\nto interfere with her religious observances.At that time her wish to\ntake the veil at St.Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too fond of\nhis sister to endure the separation.There were also rumours of a\nmarriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor Joseph.And among the many\ngood results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst\nof that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate\nunder what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed\namid flames.These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the\ntwelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic.They are,\nI believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest\nfor those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a\nvery fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a\npoint that it could not traverse the meshes.This phenomenon, which he\nattributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon\nutilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of\nmaking a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an\nenvelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch\nmeshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with\nmask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal\nbonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt\nfor the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots\nformed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one\nand a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron\nframe.Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a\nclose coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution\nof alum.The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos\ncloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter.The bonnet\ncontained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a\nsingle thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of\ndouble thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with\nthe hands.Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to\nhumanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with\nit.The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini\nbegan by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double\nlayer of wire gauze.He then held it for some instants in the flame of\na candle or alcohol lamp.One of his assistants afterward put on the\nasbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his\nhand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot\niron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or\nfifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to\nthe furnace.On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands\nin their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which\nfagots were burning.In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the\nwire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos\nbonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his\nbreast.Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a\ngreat fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head\nand remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic\ndes Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,\nconnected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave\nbetween them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long.The heat was so intense,\nwhen the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than\n20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between\nthem, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet.Six men clad in the Aldini\nsuit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and\nwalked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire\nwas being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior.One of these\nmen carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a\nchild eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos\nbonnet.This same man, having the child with him, entered on another\noccasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and\nwhose intensity was such that it could not be looked at.He remained\ntherein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;\nbut he finally came out safe and sound.One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that\nman can breathe in the midst of flames.This marvelous property cannot\nbe attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage\nthrough the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great\nresistance of our organs to the action of heat.The following, moreover,\nare direct proofs of such resistance.In England, in their first\nexperiment, Messrs.Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr.Solander\nremained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat.On\nbreathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several\ndegrees.Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,\nproduced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the\nsame impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of\na corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience\na sensation like that of a burn.A thermometer placed under the tongue\nof one of the experimenters marked 98 deg.Fahr., which is the normal\ntemperature of the human species.Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which\nthe thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg.He remained therein\neight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the\ncoolest part, which was at 240 deg.During all this time he\nexperienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he\nfelt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to\nleave the place.His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the\nminute, that is to say, double what it usually did.To ascertain whether\nthere was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find\nout what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot\nair that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in\nthe hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty\nminutes they were baked hard.A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in\nEngland, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate\nwas so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes.In the immediate\nvicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg.Persons not of\nthe trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in\nthe eyes, nose, and ears.A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a\nfurnace at 132 deg.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.C.\n\nThe resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be\nattributed to several causes.First, it has been found that the quantity\nof carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical\nphenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,\ndiminish in measure as the external temperature rises.Hence, a conflict\nwhich has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living\nbeing will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the\nsurrounding medium.On another hand, it has been observed that man\nresists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated\nwith vapors.Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature\nvarying from 109 deg.C. in dry air, could remain only twelve\nminutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg.At the\nHammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr.E.\nMartin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes.This\nphysician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg.at\nPekin, 14,000 persons perished.These facts are explained by the cooling\nthat the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the\nbody.Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater\nin dry air in motion than in calm and humid air.The observations become\nstill more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a\nsolid which suppresses perspiration.Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges\nwater of 37 deg.for half an hour; but at 45 deg.he could not remain in it more\nthan seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six\nminutes.According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near\na fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg.C. to them, can hardly\nbear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg.The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear\none of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished\nto be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries.In a vast vaulted chamber\nnearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of\nposts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,\nand tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods.When this was set\non fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the\nchamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through\npipes made for the purpose.Then the door was suddenly opened before the\nneophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor\nwas composed of an incandescent grating.The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance\n\"Sethos,\" printed at the end of last century.Unfortunately literary\nfrauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of\nan old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources.I have sought\nin special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,\nbut I have not been able to find them.I suppose, however, that\nthis description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the\nimagination.The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the\ngrating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero\nwas enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose\nit to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care\nto place his feet.He who had the\ncourage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly\nwould not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no\nother thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as\nsoon as possible.We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense\ngrate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a\ntemperature.It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the\ntwo fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had\nalso been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini\nexperiments.It is even probable that this grating was of copper,\nwhich, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying\nbrilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from\nthe fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to\na trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a\nsolid substance was felt.The early settler contented himself with the\nlog cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone\nenough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the\nsurface of the earth.Even after the desirability of more handsome and\ndurable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities\nthan wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded\nin this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by\nthe Dutch and English settlers from the Old World.Thus we find the\ncolonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list\nof non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are\ndescribed as being \"fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and\nstone,\" were thus provided only with foreign products.Isolated\ninstances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last\ncentury; but they are rare.The edifice known as \"King's Chapel,\"\nBoston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from\nAmerican stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also\nfound in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country.The first granite\nquarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,\nand work began at that point early in the present century.The fame of\nthe stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to\nNew Orleans.The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as\na custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in\nNew Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of\nQuincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic\ncoast.In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole\nblocks of stores, have been constructed of this material.It was from\nthe Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;\nthis was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset\nRiver, built in 1827.Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent\ngranite.After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island\nacquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic\ntherein.Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this\nvaluable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been\nwrought for monumental purposes.Statues and other elaborate monumental\ndesigns are now extensively made therefrom.Smaller pieces and a coarser\nquality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in\nlarge quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect\nharbors.Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New\nYork.This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy\ngranite weighs but 165.The Staten Island product is used not only for\nbuilding purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both\nthe Russ and Belgian patents.New York and other cities derive large\nsupplies from this source.The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the\nsame character, and greatly in demand.Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,\nVa, are also centers of granite production.Near Abbeville, S.C., and\nin Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.Much southern\ngranite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky\nMountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet\nquarried there.Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size\nand shape.Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and\ntransported great distances.The quarrying is done by drilling a series\nof small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance\napart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each\ngently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be\nevenly distributed.A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as\nfreestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back\nfurther than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to\nas the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at\nPortland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown.These were\nworked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many\ndistant points in the country.The long rows of \"brownstone fronts\" in\nNew York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the\nwalls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone.The\nold red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology\nfor the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed\nin the Portland quarries in 1802.Some of these footprints measured\nten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart.The\nsandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the\nproduct of these quarries; St.Lawrence County, New York, is noted also\nfor a fine bed of sandstone.At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of\nseventy feet.There are places though, in New England, New York, and\nEastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been\nreached.The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an\ninch.It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace\nhearth-stones.Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone\nof inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;\nas it wears very unevenly.From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties\nsandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;\nthe principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,\nCoxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson.In this region\nquantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large\nsheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired.The vicinity of\nMedina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that\nsection for paving and curbing, and a little for building.A rather poor\nquality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it\nwas used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,\nVermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production.Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,\nwhich is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France.The Lake\nSuperior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone\nis easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for\nbuilding, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite.A serious\nobjection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,\nwhich rusts on exposure, and defaces the building.In Western New York\nthey are widely used.Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and\nBermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,\nbut it hardens on exposure.The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and\nAthens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,\nEllittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great\nfavorites west.In many of these regions limestone is extensively used\nfor macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted.It also\nyields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by\nburning, into lime for building purposes.All limestones are by no\nmeans equally excellent in this regard.Thomaston lime, burned with\nPennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation\nfor nearly half a century.It has been shipped thence to all points\nalong the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and\ngoing even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,\nN.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly\nexcellent quality of lime.Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior\nsort for agricultural purposes.The Ohio and other western stones yield\na poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east\nfor supplies.Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very\nabundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of\ncolors.As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for\ngravestones.Its use for building purposes has been more recent than\ngranite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the\nlatter to a great degree.For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and\nlike ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and\nveined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls\nwere made from them.Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard\nCollege in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the\nCustom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury.The\nnew Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures\ncomposed of this material.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere\namount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same\namount from Italy.And yet an article can be found in the United States\nfully as fine as the famous Carrara marble.We refer to that which comes\nfrom Rutland, Vt.This state yields the largest variety and choicest\nspecimens.The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where\nthe only quality fit for statuary is obtained.Toward the north it\ndeteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to\nthe south it becomes coarser.A beautiful black marble is obtained at\nShoreham, Vt.There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same\nstate; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they\nbecome more variegated and rich in hue.Such other marble as is found\nin New England is of an inferior quality.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.The pillars of Girard\nCollege came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in\nreputation.The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,\nMaryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the\nCarolinas, to Georgia and Alabama.Some of the variegated and high\ncolored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of\nVermont.The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial\ndays.It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing\nand school purposes.It is\nstated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as\nearly as 1805.In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the\nbusiness, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains.From\nthis time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being\nan outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product\ndown the Schuylkill to Philadelphia.By 1860 the industry had reached\nthe capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles\nnorth of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the\nbusiness.Vermont began to yield in 1852.New York's quarries are\nconfined to Washington County, near the Vermont line.Maryland has\na limited supply from Harford County.The Huron Mountains, north of\nMarquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike\nCounty, Ga.Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,\nMichigan, Pennsylvania, and other States.Mica is found at Acworth and\nGrafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from\nHaywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and\nour product is so large that we can afford to export it.Other stones,\nsuch as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various\nparts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed\naccount of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nAN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.The most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the\nincrease in the number of farms.The number has virtually doubled within\ntwenty years.The population of the country has not increased in like\nproportion.A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due\nto the division of great estates.Nor has this occurred, as some may\nimagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which\nimmigration and migration have recently been directed.It is an\nimportant fact that the multiplication of", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "In New York there has\nbeen an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms\nsince 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in\nPennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and\ndoubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much\nsmaller.Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully\nsettled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and\nyet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in\nOhio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.The\nobvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has\ncreated a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be\nmost advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this\nfully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one\nof the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically.The\nman who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different\nfooting from the laborer who works for wages.It is not a small matter\nthat, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or\nmanagers of farms than there were only a decade ago.As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the\nsettlement of new land is more distinctly felt.Even in Michigan, where\nnew railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in\nnumber of farms has been over 55 per cent.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.In Wisconsin, though the\nincrease in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the\nreported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in\nIowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in\nNebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720.In\nthese regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a\nchange in the social and industrial condition of the population.Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,\nthough very great, is less surprising than the new States of the\nNorthwest.The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large\nfarms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States\nwhere land is still abundant.The greatest increase is in Texas, where\n174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with\n23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433\nfarms, against 49,424 in 1870.In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,\nagainst 148,228 in 1870.In these States, though social changes have\nbeen great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new\nsettlements, as in the States of the far Northwest.But the change in\nthe older Southern States is of a different character.Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms\nthirty years ago.But the increase in number within the past ten years\nhas been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent.Contrasting this with the increase in\nNew York, a remarkable difference appears.West Virginia had few more\nfarms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,\nand has gained in number nearly 60 per cent.North Carolina, too, has\nincreased 78 per cent.in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina\n80 per cent.In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956\nto 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent.In Alabama there are 135,864\nfarms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent.These\nproportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal\na change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution.But the\nforce of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the\nStates named.Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes\ngreater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi\nRiver, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,\nMississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic\ncoast.Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292\nfarms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,\nor less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia.In\nKentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per\ncent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,\nagainst 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern\nStates of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of\nthe older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the\nAtlantic coast.In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows\nand will almost certainly bring about important political changes within\na few years.In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or\noccupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nA FARMER'S LIME KILN.For information about burning lime we republish the following article\nfurnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years\nago:\n\n[Illustration: Fig.1), Railway Track--B B B,\nIron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well\nwithout brick or ash lining.]I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises\nabout five years ago.The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by\n25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot.It has round\niron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened\nto the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top\nshould be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed\nabout 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.The arch\nshould be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top\nand sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little\nincline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn.The arch\nshould have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of\nthe kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or\ntwo may be used with semicircle cut in each.Iron bars 2 inches wide by\n1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots\nfastened to capstone.These slots must be put in before the caps\nare laid.When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be\npushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to\ncircumstances; 3 bars will be enough.The slots are made of iron bars\n11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes\ndrilled through capstone and keyed above.The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a\nstratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick\nand wall, which proves a great protection to the wall.About 2,000\nfire-bricks were used.The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half\nthe lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of\ncommon brick and saved some expense and been just as good.The form of\nthe well shown in Fig.3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive\nof the lining of brick and ashes.Experiments in this vicinity have\nproved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being\nabsolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so\ngreat that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was\ndemonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that\nprinciple.The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires\nabout three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am\ntold, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the\nquantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of\nthe heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together\nas it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned.The\nbusiness requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level\nwith the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,\nwith light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and\na hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln.Such a location\nshould be had if possible.Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas\nof the principles of a kiln for using _coal_.The dimensions may be\nreduced, if desired.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for\nthat, and the height of kiln reduced.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are\nfive apple jelly factories in operation.The failure of the apple crop,\nfor some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great\ndegree to the natural or ungrafted fruit.Though not so many as common,\neven of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and\nthe numerous cider mills pretty well employed.The largest jelly factory\nis located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in\nregard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be\nnew and interesting, we will undertake a brief description.The factory\nis located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power.A\nportion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,\nthe slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the\nevaporating department.Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,\nand with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large\nbins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which\nthe apples are delivered from the teams.The floor in each of these has\na sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a\ngrate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough\nhalf submerged in the pond.The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds\nas follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,\nconsiderable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a\ndistance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the\nbasement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular\nfall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit\nthe escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are\nthoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter.Such is the\nfriction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing\nof the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed\nsections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away\nwith other impurities.From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an\nendless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with\niron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story\nof the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater.The press\nis wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,\nbeing actuated by the water power.The cheese is built up with layers\ninclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden\ntime, and serves also to strain the cider.As it is expressed from\nthe press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the\ndefecator.This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet\nwide.At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in\ndiameter and closed at both ends.Lying between and connecting\nthese two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,\npenetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and\nunder surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2\ninches apart.When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as\nmanifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the\npan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch\nunderneath their outer surfaces.The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about\nthree-eighths of an inch in diameter.Steam is introduced to the large\nor manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at\na pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch.Trap valves\nare provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the\npipes.The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities\nand perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it.All portions of\npomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,\nexpand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider.An\ningeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it\nover the side of the pan.To facilitate this removal, one side of the\npan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is\ncurved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined\nplane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a\ntrough and carried away.A secondary purpose served by the defecator\nis that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the\nspecific gravity of about 20 deg.When of this consistency the liquid\nis drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a\nsiphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the\nsame framework and just below the defecator.The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each\ntwelve feet long and three inches in diameter.These are each jacketed\nor inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted\nwith steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space\nsurrounding the copper tubes.The latter are open at both ends\npermitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the\nsteam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame\nso as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of\nthe current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular\nsuccession.Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam\ngauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other\npipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity.Steam being\nlet on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of\nsirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes\nany impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;\npassing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel\nconnected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the\nwhole system.The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from\n20 deg.Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes\nlater at a consistency of from 30 deg.Baume, which is found on\ncooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly.This point is found to\nvary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon\nbruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in\nexpressing the juice from the cheese.The least fermentation occasions\nthe necessity for a lower reduction.To guard against this, no cheese\nis allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no\ncider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large\nwater tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by\nmeans of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,\ntrough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and\ncleansed.Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the\ndefecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and\npurified.If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,\nthe matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the\nevaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe.If boiled cider\ninstead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn\noff from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency\ndesired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing\nthe steam pressure.As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub\nholding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little\nvariations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit\nused are equalized.From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,\ninto the various packages in which it is shipped to market.A favorite\nform of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden\nbucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds\nrespectively.The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience\nin handling.The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to\n1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours.It is calculated that\nimprovements now in progress will increase this to something more than a\nton per day.Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds\nof jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than\nearlier varieties.Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,\nnatural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all\nvarieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general\nquality.As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground\nunder a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a\nsuccession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing.Here it\nis occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of\nthe trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds\nbecoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp\nfloats away upon the stream.A succession of troughs serves to remove\nnearly all the seeds.The value of the apple seeds thus saved is\nsufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole\nestablishment.The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half\ncubic feet being accounted a bushel.This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,\nwho buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the\naccounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one\nsawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs\ninto short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds\nthe apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the\ndefecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman\nand engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general\nhelper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever\nneeded.The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,\nand manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides\nconsiderable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled\ncider.The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was\nsix to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents.The proprietor\nhopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels.These institutions are\nimportant to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise\nvaluable and very perishable.Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no\nmarket value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can\nbe used.(Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water\ndraws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press\nand evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found\nto make very good jelly.They are valuable to the consumer by converting\nthe perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant\nyears into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over\nto years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant\nform to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of\ngreat interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value\nfor purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,\nfor use as a beverage and intoxicant.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to\ngrow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that\na new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,\nParis, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit\nand hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in\nthis country.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to\nthe bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby\nrendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality\ngenerally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire\nsupport.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases\nthe amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a\nresult due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it\nand the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper\nby employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage\nthus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative\ninefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an\naverage of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference\nof 10 deg.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the\npractical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of\ngrapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only\nbe determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,\neither under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel\nthe full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their\nutility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental\nvarieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are\nscarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At\nany rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to\nneutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the\nbest of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen\nout of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to\nnothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much\nappreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor\nculture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under\nglass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords\nsome excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid\nreason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a\ngeneral way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and\nchecking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to\nget the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes\nwould often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average\ntemperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical\ncontrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average\nwarmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure\nthe grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor\nculture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now\npracticable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying\nmildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting\nadministered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for\nthe season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving\nrains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and\nautumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these\nglass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening\nof pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being\nemployed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and\nshapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing\nthe maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to\npreserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.COBNHILL, _in\nthe Garden_.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nUTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an\nexperiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the\nEnglish public and military authorities.Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration\nand utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very\nbrilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which\nprinted several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the\n_Soleil Journal_.The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the\nsame rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive\nsteam-engine at work.As may be supposed, the only object was to\ndemonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the\nsolar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems\ncapable of great utility in existing circumstances.Here in France,\nindeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have\nsuggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other\nmode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been\nlacking.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.About fifteen years ago\nProfessor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and\nhis experiments have been continued by M.

M. HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been\nof inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,\nand the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the\nneedle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate\ndetermination of permanent boundary lines have proven very\nunsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and\neven death.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to\ndispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle\nin surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of\ntraversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a\ngreater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are\ngenerally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be\nreadily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application\nin practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the\ntrue meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of\nlatitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true\nmeridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to\nthese difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,\ninstrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the\nprobable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time\nmay be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is\nreferred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes\nlost in \"confusion worse confounded,\" and gives up in despair, settling\ndown to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is\nthe best after all, even if not the most accurate.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I\nhave thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the\nmethod of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently\nclear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make\nuse of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with\nthe\n\n\nDEFINITIONS.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all\ncelestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the\nearth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing\nthrough the axis.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.All meridians are therefore north and south lines\npassing through the poles.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at\nthe pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a\nbearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are\nobliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,\nand correct the observation according to its angular distance from the\nmeridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is\ngenerally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,\nin an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.19' 13\",[1] making the revolution in\n23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above\nthe pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the\nlatter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass\nthrough the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former\nis called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,\nor at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too\ncomplicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or\nlower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this\ninvolves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude\nof the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and\nmoreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to\nthe place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,\nan error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would\nintroduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,\nhowever, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,\nthat is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the\nerror of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be\ninappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make\nthe observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be\ngiven.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the\nrelative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,\nand Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is\nhorizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the\nlatter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "This angle,\ncalled the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the\nobserver, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be\ncomputed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his\n_latitude_ before he can apply it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Let N be the north pole of the\ncelestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;\nthen N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the\nlatitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle\nof the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the\nlatitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,\npreceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called\nthe _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a\nplane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the\nnormal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,\nhence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith\nand nadir points for their poles.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.The _altitude_ of a celestial object\nis its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical\ncircle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the\ndifference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith\ndistance_, or _co-altitude_.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane\nthrough the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the\nhorizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at\n90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the\nposition of any object with reference to the observer's place.The\nlatter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude\nreferred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,\nand the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to\nthe latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,\nin which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1\nwill be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,\nand Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C\nQ1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be\nsubtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the\nlatitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either\nabove or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for\nrefraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its\n_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for\nordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with\nsufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction\nis _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by\nlooking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the\nobserver's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07\",\nshould be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 00\", leaving 40 deg.37' 53\" for the\nlatitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the\nlatitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the\nrequired azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical\ntriangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the\nnorth pole, and S is Polaris.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.In this triangle we have given the polar\ndistance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13\"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z\nP, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from\nwhich, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the\nfollowing table:\n\n       AZIMUTH TABLE FOR POINTS BETWEEN 26 deg.LATTITUDES\n ___________________________________________________________________\n|      |         |          |         |         |         |         |\n| Year |   26 deg.|\n|______|_________|__________|_________|_________|_________|_________|\n|      |         |          |         |         |         |         |\n|      |  deg.

different nights.The\nfirst is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit\nwith vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,\netc.[1] Having \"set up\" over the point through which it is proposed to\nestablish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and\nAlioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached\nlevel, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical\narc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its\n_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as\nit moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest\npart of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant\nto hold the \"bull's eye\" so as to reflect enough light down the tube\nfrom the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the\nstar, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in\nthis position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_\nwire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it \"rides\" along this\nwire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the\nvertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the\n_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by\n2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the\ncomplement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has\nsufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at\nits highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the\nhorizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another\nreading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the\n_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two\npointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting\nfrom it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the\nrefraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must\nnow wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,\nor may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the\nmeantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his\ndate and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made\non the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so\nthat when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be\nbrought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by\nmeans of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]\n\nIt is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of\nobservation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star\nmay be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at\nthe surveyor's convenience.It is always well to check the accuracy of\nthe work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in\npermanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not\nplaced near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,\nthe magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting\nan instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the\nneedle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is\nwest, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and\n_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the\nsun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of\ntime as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,\ncompared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by\ntaking the difference between the local lime of this and any other\nplace, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can\nreadily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of\nfirst contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and\ntake the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME._______________________\n    |          |            |\n    |

magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of\nbird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their\ndesiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity\nof naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal\nfeathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the\ngalleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at\nthe museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux\nParalleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a\nfew years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the\nPhasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not\ntill 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural\nHistory, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out\nthe peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the\nMuseum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves\nnothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of\nVerreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose\ntail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that\nthe museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an\nordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named\n_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of\nthe family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.The smile had lingered in her mind as a beautiful picture.Walking down\nthe stairs now, in the deepening shadows, the revelation dawned upon her\nall at once--it was his father\u2019s smile!Yes, yes--hurriedly the fancy\nreared itself in her thoughts--thus the lover of her young girlhood had\nlooked upon her.The delicate, clever face; the prettily arched lips;\nthe soft, light curls upon the forehead; the tenderly beaming blue\neyes--all were the same.very often--this resemblance had forced itself upon her\nconsciousness before.But now, lighted up by that chance babyish smile,\nit came to her in the guise of a novelty, and with a certain fascination\nin it.Her head seemed to have ceased to ache, now that this almost\npleasant thought had entered it.It was passing strange, she felt, that\nany sense of comfort should exist for her in memories which had fed\nher soul upon bitterness for so long a time.Yet it was already on the\ninstant apparent to her that when she should next have time to think,\nthat old episode would assume less hateful aspects than it had always\npresented before.At the street door she found her father leaning against a shutter and\ndiscussing the events of the day with the village lamplighter, who\ncarried a ladder on his shoulder, and reported great popular agitation\nto exist.Jessica beckoned Ben summarily aside, and put into his hands the letter\nshe had written at the shop.\u201cI want you to take this at once to Miss\nMinster, at her house,\u201d she said, hurriedly.\u201cSee to it that she gets it\nherself.Don\u2019t say a word to any living\nsoul.I\u2019ve said you can be depended\nupon.If you show yourself a man, it may make your fortune.Now, hurry;\nand I do hope you will do me credit!\u201d\n\nUnder the spur of this surprising exhortation, Ben walked away with\nunexampled rapidity, until he had overtaken the lamplighter, from whom\nhe borrowed some chewing tobacco.The girl, left to herself, began walking irresolutely down Main Street.The flaring lights in the store windows seemed to add to the confusion\nof her mind.It had appeared to be important to send her father away at\nonce, but now she began to regret that she had not kept him to help her\nin her search.For Reuben Tracy must be found at all hazards.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.How to go to work to trace him she did not know.She had no notion\nwhatever as to who his intimate friends were.The best device she could\nthink of would be to ask about him at the various law-offices; for she\nhad heard that however much lawyers might pretend to fight one another\nin court, they were all on very good terms outside.Some little distance down the street she came upon the door of another\nstairway which bore a number of lawyers\u2019 signs.The windows all up the\nfront of this building were lighted, and without further examination she\nascended the first flight of stairs.The landing was almost completely\ndark, but an obscured gleam came from the dusty transoms over three or\nfour doors close about her.She knocked on one of these at random, and\nin response to an inarticulate vocal sound from within, opened the door\nand entered.It was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with\na long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light\nleather-covered books rising along the walls.At the opposite end of the\nchamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the\ndesk, and his head in his hands.The shaded light in front of him made a\nmellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl\u2019s breast as she\nlooked at this figure.Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of\nthe voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled\nit.A gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins.This was\nHorace Boyce who sat there before her--and she did not hate him!During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of\nself-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind.This,\nthen, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with\nthe other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged\nher nearly to distraction.The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle\nprocesses, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might\na hero be by sunlit clouds.She hugged the thought to her heart, and\nstood looking at\u2019 him motionless and mute.What is wanted?\u201d he called out, querulously, without\nchanging his posture.It was as if a magic voice drew her\nforward in a dream--herself all rapt and dumb.Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head,\nand swung abruptly around in his chair.His own shadow obscured the\nfeatures of his visitor.He saw only that it was a lady, and rose\nhesitatingly to his feet.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cI was busy with my thoughts, and did not know\nwho it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know now?\u201d Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance.The balmy\nwarmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on\nher face.He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let\nhis arms fall limp at his sides.\u201cIn the name of the dev--\u201d he began, confusedly, and then bit the word\nshort, and stared at her again.\u201cIs it really you?\u201d he asked at last,\nreassured in part by her smile.\u201cAre you sorry to see me?\u201d she asked in turn.Her mind could frame\nnothing but these soft little meaningless queries.The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question.He\nturned around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight\ndetour he walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the\ndark stairway.When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key\nin the lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock\nit again.\u201cWhy, no; why should I be?\u201d he said in a more natural voice, as he\nreturned and stood beside her.Evidently her amiability was a more\ndifficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he\nstudied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.\u201cCome and sit down here,\u201d he said, after a few moments of this puzzled\ninspection, and resumed his own chair.\u201cI want a good look at you,\u201d he\nexplained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it\nrequired an effort to return his glance.But, when she did so, the\nchanges in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything\nelse from her mind.She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse,\nand bent over him at a diffident distance.As she did so, she had the\nfeeling that this bitterness in which she had encased herself for years\nhad dropped from her on the instant like a discarded garment.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.\u201cWhy, Horace, your hair is quite gray!\u201d she said, as if the fact\ncontained the sublimation of pathos.\u201cThere\u2019s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over!You\ndon\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through, my girl,\u201d he said, sadly.The\nnovel sensation of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly\naccentuated his sense of deserving compassion.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d she said, softly.She had seated herself again, and\nwas gradually recovering her self-possession.The whole situation was\nso remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it\nfrom the outside, as if she were not a component part of it.Her pulses\nwere no longer strongly stirred by its personal phases.Most clear of\nall things in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of\nthis or any other man.She was her own master, and need ask favors from\nnobody.Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a\nfriend of Horace--or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from\nthose bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her\nweary soul a bed of these--what or who was to prevent her?Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant\nin her sight again.There was no doubt about it--she had genuine\nsatisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him.Had she\nso many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon\ndeliberately away?Moreover--and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart--he\nwas worn and unhappy.The iron had palpably entered his soul too.He\nlooked years older than he had any chronological right to look.There\nwere heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was\npowdered thick with silver.\u201cYes, I am truly sorry,\u201d she said again.\u201cIs it business that has gone\nwrong with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness--family--health--sleep--everything!\u201d he groaned, bitterly.\u201cIt\nis literally a hell that I have been living in this last--these last few\nmonths!\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea of that,\u201d she said, simply.Of course it would be\nridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had\ncomfort from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.\u201cSo help me God, Jess!\u201d he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of\nher sympathy, \u201cI\u2019m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and\nevery woman a fool!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a long time when _I_ thought that,\u201d she said with a sigh.He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly\nturned his glance away.\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he answered uneasily, tapping\nwith his fingers on the desk.\u201cBut we won\u2019t talk of that,\u201d she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety\nin her tone.\u201cWe needn\u2019t talk of that at all.It was merely by accident\nthat I came here, Horace.I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was\nfurther from my head than finding you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see--Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.I didn\u2019t know you knew him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you foolish boy!\u201d she said, with a smile which had a ground tone\nof sadness.It was simply any lawyer I was\nlooking for.But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you\nany more.I\u2019ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were--young\ntogether, and I\u2019m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an\nenemy.You don\u2019t seem so very happy yourself, Horace.Why shouldn\u2019t\nwe two be friends again?I\u2019m not talking of anything else,\nHorace--understand me.But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of\nour being friends again.\u201d\n\nHorace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\u201cYou\u2019re the best\nof the lot, dear old Jess,\u201d he said at last, smiling candidly.\u201cTruly\nI\u2019m glad you came--gladder than I can tell you.I was in the very slough\nof despond when you entered; and now--well, at least I\u2019m going to play\nthat I am out of it.\u201d\n\nJessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on\nhis shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m glad I", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "\u201cAnd very soon I want to\nsee you again--when you are quite free--and have a long, quiet talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, my girl,\u201d he answered, rising as well.The prospect seemed\nentirely attractive to him.He took her hand in his, and said again:\n\u201cAll right.And must you go now?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, mercy, yes!\u201d she exclaimed, with sudden recollection.\u201cI had no\nbusiness to stay so long!Perhaps you can tell me--or no--\u201d She vaguely\nput together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been\npartners, and seemed to be so no longer.\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I so poor a legal reputation as all that?\u201d he said, lightly\nsmiling.One\u2019s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their\nbad opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t about law,\u201d she explained, stum-blingly.Good-by for the time.\u201d\n\nHe would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently\nprevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.\u201cNot that,\u201d she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.And--good-by, Horace, for the\ntime.\u201d\n\nHe went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might\nsee her way down the stairs.When she had disappeared, he walked for\na little up and down the room, whistling softly to himself.It was\nundeniable that the world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only\na half-hour before.Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself\nwas a refreshing novelty.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.\u201cA damned decent sort of girl--considering everything!\u201d he mused aloud,\nas he locked up his desk for the day.CHAPTER XXXII.--THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.To come upon the street again was like the confused awakening from a\ndream.With the first few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an\nextremity of cold, yet still uncomfortably warm.A sudden passing spasm\nof giddiness, too, made her head swim so that for the instant she feared\nto fall.Then, with an added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and\ndesponding.The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she\nhad stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of\nself-reproach.The burning headache had returned, and with it came a\npained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in\nher to weakly dally in Horace\u2019s office when such urgent responsibility\nrested upon her outside.If the burden of this responsibility appeared\ntoo great for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so\nstrangely leaving her, there was all the more reason for her to set her\nteeth together, and press forward, even if she staggered as she went.The search had been made cruelly\nhopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness\nfor it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she\nought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers--a little\naway from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to court\nobservation.These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to her\nfeverish mind.She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of\nthem intended--which no doubt even now they were canvassing in furtive\nwhispers--and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless to find\nhim!There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this\nanguish of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow\narrested her attention.It was a familiar enough figure--that of old\n\u201cCal\u201d Gedney; and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in\nthe fact that he was walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed\nintently on the sidewalk.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.He had passed again out of the range of her\ncursory glance before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and\neven some kind of a judge.She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she\ncame up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that\nfor the moment she could not speak.The \u2019squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.\u201cLeave me alone, you hussy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cor I\u2019ll lock you up!\u201d\n\nHis misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind.\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish,\u201d\n she said, hurriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of perhaps life and death!Do you\nknow where Reuben Tracy is?Or can you tell me where I can find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t want to be bothered with _you_, wherever he is,\u201d was the surly\nresponse.\u201cBe off with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you it was a matter of life and death,\u201d she insisted, earnestly.\u201cHe\u2019ll never forgive you--you\u2019ll never forgive yourself--if you know and\nwon\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\nThe sincerity of the girl\u2019s tone impressed the old man.It was not easy\nfor him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was\nevidently clear enough.\u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d he asked, in a less unfriendly voice.Then\nhe added, in a reflective undertone: \u201cCur\u2019ous\u2019t I sh\u2019d want see Tracy,\ntoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you do know where he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s drove out to \u2019s mother\u2019s farm.You\u2019re one of that Lawton tribe, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?\u201d She asked the\nquestion with swift directness.She added in explanation, as he stared\nvacantly at her: \u201cI ask that because you said you wanted to see him,\nthat\u2019s all.I shall go alone if you won\u2019t come.He\u2019s _got_ to be back\nhere this evening, or God only knows what\u2019ll happen!I mean what I say!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the road?\u201d the \u2019squire asked, catching something of her\nown eager spirit.I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t tell me what your business is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this much,\u201d she whispered, hastily.\u201cThere is going to\nbe a mob at the Minster house to-night.A girl who knows one of the men\ntold--\u201d\n\nThe old \u2019squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with\nfierce energy.\u201cCome on--come on!\u201d he said, hoarsely.We\u2019ll gallop the horses both ways.\u201d He muttered to himself with\nexcitement as he dragged her along.Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable\nperiod, while old \u201cCal\u201d was getting the horses--walking up and down the\npath in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily\nsuffering.When she conjured up before her frightened mind the\nterrible consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an\nintolerable hour of torture.There was even the evil chance that the old\nman had been refused the horses because he had been drinking.Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the\nplank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then\nthe \u2019squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of\nrobes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into\nher own hands.\u201cLet me drive,\u201d she said, clucking the horses into a\nrapid trot.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.I\u2019m too ill to sit up, unless\nI\u2019m doing something that keeps me from giving up.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nReuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse\nto be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother\nEzra--a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now beside\nhim in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged feet\non the hearth, and a last week\u2019s agricultural paper on his knee.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.Ezra\nwas a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking\nat things, and considerable powers of expression.As a rule, the\nlawyer liked to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and\nsuggestions from the talk.But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of\nkeeping down the \u201cfidgets\u201d one of incredible difficulty.His mother--on\nwhose account he had been summoned--was so much better that Ezra\u2019s wife\nhad felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some much-needed\nrest.Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about the tariff\nduty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the dim-faced\nold wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o\u2019clock.The kerosene lamp\non the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light through its smoky\nchimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the stuffy air of the\nover-heated room.A ragged and strong-smelling old farm dog groaned\noffensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.Even the\ndraught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the stove\nand up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very futility\nof its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far\naway from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself\nwondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it.The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys\nof energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere\nsensation of living where it was really life--all went away, leaving\nnone but the Ezras behind.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them\never came back.And the Ezras who remained on the farms--they seemed to\nshut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their\nown lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly\nin Reuben\u2019s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the\nMinsters.It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind\u2019s pendulum\nseparated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and\nbarren farmhouse room.And he, who had been born and reared in this\nlatter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single\nevening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other\nremoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.Curious slaves of habit--creatures of their surroundings--men were!A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his\nrevery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright\nrubbed them confusedly.\u201cNow I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,\u201d said Reuben, rising.\u201cIt\ncan\u2019t be the doctor this time of night, can it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt \u2019ud be jest like him,\u201d commented Ezra, captiously.\u201cHe\u2019s a great\nhand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there\u2019s sickness in\nthe house.It all goes down in his bill.\u201d\n\nThe farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked\nheavily in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way.Some\nindistinct words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his\nhuge hairy hand, Ezra turned his head.\u201cSomebody to see you, Rube,\u201d he said.On second thought he added to the\nvisitor in a tone of formal politeness: \u201cWon\u2019t you step in, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\nJessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to\nhis invitation.But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change\ninto a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform.She\nstood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously\ntwitching.Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,\nshe trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,\nand fell inertly into Ezra\u2019s big, protecting arm.\u201cI guessed she was going to do it,\u201d said the farmer, not dissembling his\npride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and\nholding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph.\u201cHannah keeled over\nin that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of\nthe wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!\u201d\n\nReuben had hurriedly come to his brother\u2019s assistance.The two men\nplaced the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began\nwith anxious fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her\ngloves.Her fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now\nalmost equally cold, was covered with perspiration.Reuben rubbed her\nhands between his broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was\nthe right thing to do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for\nthe household bottle of brandy.Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit\nupon her whitened lips.She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar\nscene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer.Then\nshe smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.\u201cShe is an old friend of mine,\u201d whispered Reuben to his brother, as he\npressed the brandy once more upon her.It\nmust be something serious that brought her out here.\u201d\n\nThe girl languidly opened her eyes.\u201c\u2018Cal\u2019 Ged-ney\u2019s asleep in the\nsleigh,\u201d she murmured.He\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nIt was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while\nEzra hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her\nhead sank with utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the\nold-fashioned chair.Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety--once or twice holding\nthe lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what--until\nhis brother returned.Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and\nremained outside now to blanket them, while the old \u2019squire, benumbed\nand drowsy, found his way into the house.It was evident enough to the\nyoung lawyer\u2019s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.\u201cWell, what does this all mean?\u201d he demanded, with vexed asperity.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!\u201d\n said the \u2019squire.\u201cQuick--there ain\u2019t a minute to lose!\u201d The old man\nalmost gasped in his eagerness.Have you been to Cadmus?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and got my pocket full of affidavits.We can send all three of\nthem to prison fast enough.But that\u2019ll do to-morrow; for to-night\nthere\u2019s a mob up at the Minster place._Look there!_\u201d\n\nThe old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside.He\nheld it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the\nreflection of a fire.it\u2019s the rolling mill,\u201d ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.\u201cQuite as likely it\u2019s the Minster house; it\u2019s the same direction, only\nfarther off, and fires are deceptive,\u201d said Gedney, his excitement\nrising under the stimulus of the spectacle.Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said, working furiously at the laces.\u2019Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table as\nhe unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative.The Lawton\ngirl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the\nMinsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find\nTracy.By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in\nthe sleigh together.She had insisted upon driving, and as his long\njourney from Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the\nback seat and gone to sleep under the buffalo robes.He knew nothing\nmore until Ezra had roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a\nstandstill on the road outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica\ngone, the horses wet and shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky\nbehind them all ablaze.Looks as if the whole town was burning,\u201d said Ezra,\ncoming in as this recital was concluded.\u201cThem horses would a-got their\ndeath out there in another ten minutes.Guess I\u2019d better put \u2019em in\nthe barn, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no!I\u2019ve got to drive them back faster than\nthey came,\u201d said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat.\u201cHurry, and\nget me some thick gloves to drive in.I\u2019ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and\nlet me know how she is.Tell her I _had_ to go.\u201d\n\nWhen Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the\nfirst time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of\nthe girl in the rocking-chair.\u201cI\u2019ll get Hannah up,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cand she can have your room.I\nguess she\u2019s too sick to try to go back with you.If she\u2019s well enough,\nI\u2019ll bring her in in the morning.I was going to take in some apples,\nanyway.\u201d\n\nTo their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at\nthese words.\u201cNo,\u201d she said; \u201cI feel better now--much better.I really must.\u201d She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though\nshe was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile\nin imposing upon her unskilled companions.Perhaps if Hannah had been\n\u201cgot up\u201d she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and\ninsisted on having matters ordered otherwise.Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and\n\u2019Squire Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben\nimpatiently led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.\u201cNo; I\u2019d rather be in front with you,\u201d the girl said, when Reuben had\nspread the robes for her to sit in the back seat.\u201cLet the Judge sit\nthere; he wants to sleep.I\u2019m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.\u201d\n\nThus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,\nstarted the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.CHAPTER XXXIII.--PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.For some time there was no conversation in the sleigh.The horses sped\nevenly forward, with their heads well in the air, as if they too were\nexcited by the unnatural glare in the sky ahead.Before long there was\nadded to the hurried regular beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed\ntrack another sound--the snoring of the \u2019squire on the seat behind.There was a sense of melting in the air.Save where the intense glow\nof the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy\nluminance--fierce orange at the central base, and then through an\nexpanse of vermilion, rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull\nreddish purples--the heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds.A\npleasant, moist night-breeze came softly across the valley, bearing ever\nand again a solitary flake of snow.The effect of this mild wind was so\ngrateful to Jessica\u2019s face, now once more burning with an inner heat,\nthat she gave no thought to a curious difficulty in breathing which was\ngrowing upon her.\u201cThe scoundrels shall pay dear for this,\u201d Reuben said to her, between\nset teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be\nallowed to walk up hill.\u201cI\u2019m sure I hope so,\u201d she said, quite in his spirit.The husky note in her voice caught his attention.\u201cAre you sure you\nare bundled up warm enough?\u201d he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe\nhigher about her.I caught a heavy cold yesterday,\u201d she\nanswered.\u201cBut it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.\u201d\n\nIt struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip\nonce more to the horses: \u201cGod only knows what can be done when I do\nget there!\u201d It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be\nequal to any emergency--even an armed riot.There was something almost\ndisheartening in this confession of self-doubt.\u201cBut at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,\u201d he broke out,\nangrily, a moment later.\u201cDown to the last pennyweight we will have our\npound of flesh!My girl,\u201d he added, turning to look into her face, and\nspeaking with deep earnestness, \u201cI never knew what it was before to feel\nwholly merciless--absolutely without bowels of compassion.But I will\nnot abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains.I swear\nthat!\u201d\n\nBy an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction\nwithin her.\u201cThey feel very bitterly,\u201d she ventured to suggest.\u201cIt is\nterrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families\ndependent on that work for bare existence.And then the bringing in of\nthese strange workmen.I suppose that is what--\u201d\n\nReuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking of them,\u201d\n he said.\u201cPoor foolish fellows, I don\u2019t wish them any harm.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.I only\npray God they haven\u2019t done too much harm to themselves.No: it\u2019s the\nswindling scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief--_they_ are\nthe ones I\u2019ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.\u201d\n\nThe words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke\nfurther: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me\nto-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all\nthree of these ruffians to State prison.I haven\u2019t had time to\nexamine the papers yet, but he says he\u2019s got them in his pocket\nthere--affidavits from the original inventor of certain machinery, about\nits original sale, and from others who were a party to it--which makes\nthe whole fraud absolutely clear.I\u2019ll go over them to-night, when we\u2019ve\nseen this thing through\u201d--pointing vaguely with his whip toward the\nreddened sky--\u201cand if tomorrow I don\u2019t lay all three of them by the\nheels, you can have my head for a foot-ball!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand these things very well,\u201d said Jessica.\u201cWho is it\nyou mean?\u201d It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp\npain came in her breast now with almost every respiration.Her head\nached, too, so violently that she cared very little indeed who it was\nthat should go to prison tomorrow.\u201cThere are three of them in the scheme,\u201d said the lawyer; \u201cas\ncold-blooded and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned.First, there\u2019s a New York man named Wendover--they call him a Judge--a\nsmart, subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one.Then there\u2019s\nSchuyler Tenney--perhaps you know who he is--he\u2019s a big hardware\nmerchant here; and with him in the swindle was--Good heavens!Why, I\nnever thought of it before!\u201d\n\nReuben had stopped short in his surprise.He began whipping the horses\nnow with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit\nglance toward his companion.\u201cIt\u2019s just occurred to me,\u201d he said.\u201cCurious--I hadn\u2019t given it a\nthought.Why, my girl, it\u2019s like a special providence.You, too, will\nhave your full revenge--such revenge as you never dreamt of.The third\nman is Horace Boyce!\u201d\n\nA great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl\u2019s reason as she took in\nthese words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been\nplunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were\nstill rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the\nvillage.The firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish\neffect like the northern lights.Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar,\nand the \u2019squire was steadily snoring behind them.\u201cYou will send them all to prison--surely?\u201d she was able to ask.\u201cAs surely as God made little apples!\u201d was the sententious response.The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so\nterribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten.Only her\nthrobbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an\nawful need that she should think clearly!She bit her lips in tortured\nsilence, striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay\nhold upon something which should be of help.They had begun to descend the hill--a steep, uneven road full of drifts,\nbeyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the village\nitself--when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on the instant\nhad shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of resolution.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.She laid her hand on Reuben\u2019s arm.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll change into the back seat,\u201d she said, in a\nvoice which all her efforts could not keep from shaking.It\u2019ll be easier for me there.\u201d\n\nReuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her\nstrength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,\nand under the robe, into the rear seat.The \u2019squire was sunk in such a\nprofound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own half of\nthe space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled her\nwith so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed\nmiraculously to have returned to her.She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon\nherself, and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set\nherself about.This was nothing less than to secure the papers which\nthe old \u2019squire had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she\nremembered his having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his\ncoats.Slowly and deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat,\nand gently pushed aside the cloth until her hand might have free\npassage to and from the pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had\ndiscovered a bundle of thick papers to be resting.Then whole minutes\nseemed to pass before, having taken off her glove, she was able to draw\nthis packet out.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Once during this operation Reuben half turned to speak\nto her, and her fright was very great.But she had had the presence of\nmind to draw the robe high about her, and answer collectedly, and he had\npalpably suspected nothing.As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his\ndrunken sleep.The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man\nup again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to\ndraw on and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had\ngained the outskirts of the village.She herself was breathing almost\nas heavily as the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was\ndone, lay back wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint\nand muscle, and a sickening dread in her mind lest there should be\nneither strength nor courage forthcoming for what remained to do.For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from\nwhom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened.At last,\nhowever, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed\nin the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted\nfrom the sidewalk, in response to Reuben\u2019s questions, sundry leading\nfacts of importance.A fire had started--probably incendiary--in the basement of the office\nof the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well gutted\nthe building.The firemen were still playing on the ruins.An immense\ncrowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he had\never seen in Thessaly.Where the money came from to buy so much drink,\nwas what puzzled him.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some\nsaid they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a\n\u201chorning.\u201d He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the\nrheumatics if he stayed out any longer.Probably he would get them, as\nit was.Everybody said that the building was insured, and some folks\nhinted that the company had it set on fire themselves.Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt \u201cMuch\nobliged,\u201d and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of\nthe conflagration.The outer walls\nof the office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing\nwas left but a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground.Some firemen were inside the yard, but more were congregated about the\nwater-soaked space where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where\nhot coffee was being passed around to them.Here, too, there was a\nreport that the crowd had gone up to the Minster house.The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of\nhose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare\nstones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the\nstreams from the hydrants.Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash\nthem into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore\nonward toward the seminary road.At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben\ndeemed it prudent to draw up.There was evidently a considerable throng\nin the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the\nlawn within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came\ntherefrom.Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and\nrough jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly\nvisible assemblage.The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook\nold Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.\u201cHold these lines,\u201d he said, \u201cand wait here for me.--Or,\u201d he turned to\nJessica with the sudden thought, \u201cwould you rather he drove you home?\u201d\n\nThe girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body.At\nthe question she roused herself and shook her head.\u201cNo: let me stay\nhere,\u201d she said, wearily.But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to\nfree his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic\nstride in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit\nupright, and then to rise to her feet.\u201cYou\u2019d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn\u2019t come back\nright off,\u201d she said to the \u2019squire.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\u201cI\u2019ll walk up and down,\u201d she answered, clambering with difficulty out of\nthe sleigh.\u201cI\u2019m tired of sitting still.\u201d\n\nOnce on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a\nfence-picket for support.The hand which she instinctively raised to her\nheart touched the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought\nwhich this inspired put new courage into her veins.With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon\nthe Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.CHAPTER XXXIV.--THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.Even before he reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon\nthe Minster lawn, Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and\ngathered that the people in the street outside were in the main peaceful\non-lookers, who did not understand very clearly what was going on, and\ndisapproved of the proceedings as far as they comprehended them.There\nwas a crowd inside the grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who\nwere out of work, but composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys\nand young hoodlums generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge\nin horseplay.There was a report that some sort of deputation had gone\nup on the doorstep and rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks\nto the occupants of the house; but that they had failed to get any\nanswer, and certainly the whole front of the residence was black as\nnight.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to\nfollow him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen.Doubtless many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu\nprocession had it not been so hopelessly dark.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the apple.The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his\nway up the gravelled path through the crowd.No special opposition was\noffered to his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only\nthose immediately affected knew anything about it.Although the path\nwas fairly thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing\nthere.Those who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a\njoke, the point of which was growing more and more obscure.Except for\nsome sporadic horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity\nof the assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered\namong them two or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last\nPresidential campaign, and a grotesque jack-o\u2019-lantem made of a pumpkin\nand elevated on a broom-stick.These urchins were running about among\nthe little groups of bystanders, knocking off one another\u2019s caps,\nshouting prodigiously, and having a good time.As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of\nthese lads raised the cry of \u201cHere\u2019s the coppers!\u201d and the crowd at\nthis seemed", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "This sound was\none less of menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last\nsomething was going to happen.One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation,\nplaced himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the\nhead of the advancing group.This, drolly enough, lent the movement a\nsemblance of authority, or at least of significance, before which the\nmen more readily than ever gave way.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.At this the other boys with\nthe torches and jack-o\u2019-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy\u2019s\nimmediate supporters, and they in turn were followed by the throng\ngenerally.Thus whimsically escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of\nthe mansion.A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here,\nsome of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything\nwas, Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least\nvisibly responsible for this strange gathering.Presumably they were\ntaken by surprise at his appearance with such a following.At any\nrate, they, too, offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the\nplatform of the steps without difficulty.Then he turned and whispered\nto a friend to have the boys with the torches also come up.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.This was\na suggestion gladly obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the\nlow-comedy pumpkin, whose illumination created a good-natured laugh.Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng.The\ngathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds\nthat the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Then there were\nadmonitory shouts here and there, under the influence of which the\nhorn-blowing gradually ceased, and Tracy\u2019s name was passed from mouth to\nmouth until its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer\non the outskirts of the crowd.In answer to this two or three hostile\ninterrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor\nthese, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.\u201cMy friends,\u201d he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his\nvoice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of \u201clouder!\u201d rose\nfrom the darkness of the central lawn.\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of waking the fine ladies,\u201d called out an anonymous voice.\u201cShut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,\u201d was another shout.\u201cBegorrah, it\u2019s the pumpkin that _is_ talkin\u2019 now!\u201d cried a shrill third\nvoice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.\u201cMy friends,\u201d began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without\nimmediate interruption, \u201calthough I don\u2019t know precisely why you have\ngathered here at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to\nsay to you which I think you will regard as important.I have not seen\nthe persons who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily\nunderstand that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them\nsome anxiety, I am sure that they, when they come to understand it,\nwill be as glad as I am that you _are_ here, and that I am given this\nopportunity of speaking for them to you.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.If you had not taken this\nnotion of coming here tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you\nto meet me somewhere else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters\nover.\u201cFirst of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened\npromptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken\nabout the law, the rolling mills too.I give you my word for that, as\nthe legal representative of two of these women.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; they\u2019ll be opened with the Frenchmen!\u201d came a swift answering\nshout.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.\u201cOr will you get Chinamen?\u201d cried another, amid derisive laughter.Reuben responded in his clearest tones: \u201cNo man who belongs to Thessaly\nshall be crowded out by a newcomer.I give you my word for that, too.\u201d\n\nSome scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised\nfor the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the\nprevalent anxiety to hear more.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.In this momentary interval Reuben caught\nthe sound of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the\nfront door, and guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new\nauditor might be.\u201cSecondly,\u201d he went on, \u201cyou ought to be told the truth about the\nshutting down of the furnaces and the lockout.These women were not at\nall responsible for either action.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.I know of my own knowledge that both\nthings caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond\nmeasure at the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to\nundersell and drive away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen.I\nwant you to realize this, because otherwise you would do a wrong in your\nminds to these good women who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our\nvillage and its people as any other soul within its borders, and who,\nfor their own sake as well as that of Stephen Minster\u2019s memory, deserve\nrespect and liking at your hands.\u201cI may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in\nwhom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power\nto these unworthy men.The result was a series of steps which they\ndeplored, but did not know how to stop.A few days ago I was called\ninto the case to see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from\nwhich they, and you, and the townspeople generally, suffer.Since then I\nhave been hard at work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can\nsay with authority that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to\nimpoverish you will be beaten all along the line.\u201d\n\nThis time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged.When\nit died away, some voice called out, \u201cThree cheers for the ladies!\u201d and\nthese were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o\u2019-lantem boy,\nwho waved his pumpkin vigorously.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.\u201cOne word more,\u201d called out Tracy, \u201cand I hope you will take in good\npart what I am going to say.When I made my way up through the grounds,\nI was struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come\nhere.I gather now that word was passed around during the day that there\nwould be a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what,\nwould be done after they got here.I do not know who started the idea,\nor who circulated the word.It might be worth your while to find out.Meanwhile, don\u2019t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and\nuncivil way of going at the thing?This is a free country, but just\nbecause it _is_ free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one\nanother\u2019s rights.There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a\ncitizen, or rather a subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or\njoin a riot.But here there ought to be no mob; there should be no room\nfor even thought of a riot.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Our very strength lies in the idea that we\nare our own policemen--our own soldiery.I say this not because one in\na hundred of you meant any special harm in coming here, but because the\nnotion of coming itself was not American.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Beware of men who suggest that\nkind of thing.Beware of men who preach the theory that because you are\npuddlers or moulders or firemen, therefore you are different from the\nrest of your fellow-citizens.I, for one, resent the idea that because I\nam a lawyer, and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong\nto different classes.I wish with all my heart that everybody resented\nit, and that that abominable word \u2018classes\u2019 could be wiped out of the\nEnglish language as it is spoken in America.I am glad if\nyou feel easier in your minds than you did when you came.If you do,\nI guess there\u2019s been no harm done by your coming which isn\u2019t more than\nbalanced by the good that has come out of it.Only next time, if you\ndon\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll have our meeting somewhere else, where it will be\neasier to speak than it is in a snowstorm, and where we won\u2019t keep our\nneighbors awake.And now good-night, everybody.\u201d\n\nOut of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd\nat this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:\n\n\u201cGive us the names of the men who, you say, _were_ responsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that to-night.But if you read the next list of\nindictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a\nlawyer you\u2019ll find them all there.\u201d\n\nThe loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there\nwas a sustained roar when Tracy\u2019s name was shouted out above the tumult.Some few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many\nothers called out to him a personal \u201cgood-night.\u201d The last of those to\nshake the accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their\nsteps homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had\nsuddenly become illuminated.Thus Reuben\u2019s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been\nplanned to be a mob was accomplished.It is remembered to this day as\nthe best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is\nalways spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence.But he himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded\nbecause the better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him\nto succeed, and because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and\nbright-witted lot of men with the idea that he wasn\u2019t a humbug.*****\n\nAt the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success.His hair was\nstreaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore,\nand the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great\nexcitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway\nopened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the\nservant on the threshold, said: \u201cWe want you to come in, Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.Tracy,\u201d he\nturned mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort\nand a chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of\nhis speech to the crowd.The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to\nall his senses.He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of\nclaret which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the\ndrawing-room and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth,\nso very happy, that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears\nin his eyes.It seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart--the\nanger, and fright, and terrible anxiety--had lasted for whole weary\nyears.Trial by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through\nwhich he had passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and\nmental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the\nbeautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice.The liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones\nwhich wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of\nshining white robes and celestial harps--an indefinitely glorious\nrecompense for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow\nof death.Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright\nspell by speech.\u201cWe heard almost every word of what you said,\u201d Kate was saying.\u201cWhen\nyou began we were in this room, crouched there by the window--that is,\nEthel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen--and at\nfirst we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your\nvoice.That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if _I_ should have\nbeen---at least, equally quick to know it--that is, I mean, I\u2019ve heard\nyou speak so much more than she has.And then we both hurried up-stairs,\nand lifted the window--and oh!\u201cAnd from the moment we knew it was you--that you were here--we felt\nperfectly safe.It doesn\u2019t seem now that we were very much afraid, even\nbefore that, although probably we were.There was a lot of hooting, and\nthat dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang the\ndoor-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done.So\nI daresay they only wanted to scare us.Of course it was the fire that\nmade us really nervous.We got that brave girl\u2019s warning about the mob\u2019s\ncoming here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the\nblaze; and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl?\u201cHere it is,\u201d answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her\nbosom, and reading aloud:\n\n\u201cDear Miss Minster:\n\n\u201cI have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night\nto do violent things.I am starting out to try and bring you help.Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to\ndo.\u201cGratefully yours,\n\n\u201cJessica Lawton.\u201d\n\nReuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.\u201cI am ashamed of myself,\u201d he said; \u201cI\u2019ve left her out there all this\nwhile.There was so much else that really she\nescaped my memory altogether.\u201d\n\nHe had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.\u201cYou will come back, won\u2019t you?\u201d Kate asked.\u201cThere are so many things\nto talk over, with all of us.And--and bring her too, if--if she will\ncome.\u201d\n\nWith a sign of acquiescence and comprehension.Reuben darted down the\nsteps and into the darkness.In a very few minutes he returned,\ndisappointment written all over his face.Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off\nas soon as I had got out of sight.I had offered to have him drive her\nhome, but she refused.She\u2019s a curiously independent girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d said Kate.\u201cBut I will go over the first thing in the\nmorning and thank her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,\u201d\n put in the lawyer.\u201cI don\u2019t mean that it was so great a thing--my\ncoming--but she drove all the way out to my mother\u2019s farm to bring me\nhere to-night, and fainted when she got there.If\nher father is still here, I think he\u2019d better go at once to her place,\nand see about her.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben\nLawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as\nthe responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the\nhallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank\nface.He assented with readiness to Reuben\u2019s idea, when it was explained to\nhim.\u201cSo she druv out to your mother\u2019s place for you, did she?\u201d he commented,\nadmiringly.\u201cThat girl\u2019s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,\u201d he\nadded, with an apologetic smile, \u201cof the old, old block.I ain\u2019t got so\nmuch git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a\nregular snorter!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John took the milk there.Lawton,\u201d said\nKate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.\u201cBe sure that you tell your\ndaughter, too, how grateful we all are.\u201d\n\nBen took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it\nwith formal awkwardness.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.\u201cI didn\u2019t seem to do much,\u201d he said, deprecatingly, \u201cand perhaps I\nwouldn\u2019t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin\u2019\nand gougin\u2019 and wras\u2019lin\u2019 round generally.But you can bet your boots,\nma\u2019am, that I\u2019d a-done what I could!\u201d\n\nWith this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps\nwith a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume\nbefore.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of\ncharmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,\nand then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.\u201cIf you will give me your arm,\u201d she said, in a delicious murmur, \u201cwe\nwill go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us\nthere.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have\none to-night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.The scene which opened upon Reuben\u2019s eyes was like a vista of\nfairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold\nframes and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,\ncontributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of\nthe table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which\nfell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and\nsoftened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished\ngleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues\nfrom the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here\nwhich gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,\nand fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which\ncan make the breaking of bread a poem.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or\ntwice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was\nin his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably\nhis future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted\npath--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even\nentertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward\nto self-possession.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and\nthereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them\nto be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something\ndisconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the\nreflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced\nbreathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd\noutside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Minster, who sat at\nthe head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica\u2019s ride, of her\nfainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this\nhe drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he\nhad sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the\nmorning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he\nwould summarily take.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.Minster,\u201d he concluded, when the servant\nhad again left the room, \u201cno real loss will result from this whole\nimbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared\nup; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly\nManufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority\ninterest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not\nentirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that\nyou will come out winner.\u201d\n\nMrs.\u201cMy daughters thought that I knew\nnothing about business!\u201d she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the\nmatter undiscussed.\u201cAnd will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?\u201d asked Ethel,\nfrom Reuben\u2019s right.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his\nbitterness had evaporated.\u201cMen ought to be punished for such a crime as\nthey committed,\u201d he said.\u201cIf only as a duty to the public, they should\nbe prosecuted.\u201d\n\nHe was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes\nmet, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:\n\n\u201cOf course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself\nwith the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I\nwas full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to\nbe punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even\ntell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage\nin settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand\njury.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a consideration which we won\u2019t discuss,\u201d said Kate.\u201cIf my mind\nwere clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the\ndecision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking\na great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce\nwas, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I know.\u201d Reuben bowed his head gravely.\u201cWell, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous\nyoungster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits\ncame to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d urged Kate.He was weak,\nfoolish, vain--whatever you like.But I\ndon\u2019t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had\nany idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,\u201d\n the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, \u201cto be frank, there are\nreasons for my thinking so.\u201d\n\nReuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful\ninflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and\nmirrored that feeling in his glance.\u201cIt is my notion that he was deceived, at\nthe beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,\u201d responded\nKate.\u201cAnd that is why,\u201d put in Ethel, \u201cwe feel like asking you not to take\nthe matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.It would\nbe too dreadful to think of--to take a man who had dined at your house,\nand been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the Orange\nMountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him into\nprison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and down\non a treadmill.No; we mustn\u2019t do that, Mr.Tracy.\u201d\n\nKate added musingly: \u201cHe has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,\ncan we not?\u201d\n\nThen Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except \u201cyes.\u201d\n His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover\u2019s interpretation of this\nspeech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words\nabout allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a\nfinal decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the\ntable knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the\natmosphere grew lighter.\u201cAnd now for the real thing,\u201d said Kate, gayly.\u201cI am commissioned on\nbehalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our\nrescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in\nthe library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were\nin such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn\u2019t tell her when you\nbegan--but she couldn\u2019t help hearing the horns, and she is as much\nobliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d assented Mrs.\u201cI don\u2019t know where the police\nwere, at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police could have done next to nothing, if they had been\nhere,\u201d said Reuben.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.\u201cThe visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and\ndiscreditable in its way, but I don\u2019t really imagine there was ever any\nactual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works\nand the importation of the French Canadians, and I don\u2019t blame them;\nbut as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.My own notion is\nthat the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve\nin frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with itself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.The truth is, that the mob isn\u2019t an American\ninstitution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals\nto reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they\nwere quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.\u201d\n\n\u201cEthel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened\npromptly,\u201d said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might\nmean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: \u201cYes, Mrs.And so they must\nbe opened, on Monday.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.It is my dearest\nwish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to\nmake a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we\nshould defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it\ncan.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and\nwho can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not\ndare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian\nof your interests quite as much as of your daughters\u2019.I am very proud\nand happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for\nacting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot\nnow be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,\u201d said Ethel,\nmerrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their\nconsiderable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been\nbrought around.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,\nwas gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There\nhad been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly\nalong, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt\nthat he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that\nwere past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to\nminister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of\nattention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the\nfamily had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy\nhad surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary\nto keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one\nanother, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent\nthan spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.The outside world\nhad shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened\nlight was home.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the apple there.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,\nof romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it\nwas centred.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark\nupon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of\nsmiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely\nprompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone\naway, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He\nheld her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed\nhis lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect\nagain, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel\u2019s\nface, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal\ndreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,\ntrembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down\nthe path to the street.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.bless you!\u201d was what the song-birds\ncarolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had\nsaid, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his\nprogress.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the\nether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was\nthere ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the\nuniverse?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air\nwas colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of\nwinter.To the lover\u2019s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely\nnearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which\nthey burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked\nthemselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward\nglide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was\napparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified\nonward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****\n\nAt the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a\nneighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow\nwhich lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,\nand he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama\nspread overhead.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his\ncane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and\nhis brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he\npassed, \u201cHello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d and had only\nan inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories\nof impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and\nGeneral Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That\nHorace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only\ntoo evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal\nroof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but\nindulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and\nquip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him\nlike a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful\nweakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and\nto their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked\ndisgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but\nwinks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when\nhe came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very\nvagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path\nwhich encircled the small yard to reach the front door.He cursorily\nnoted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the\nsnow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out\nlate.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the\nlower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which\ngave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,\nobviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and\narms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an\ninstant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped\nit, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the\nreverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,\nunlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up\nthe gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very\nill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for\nDr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--\u201cI TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!\u201d\n\n Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed\nby stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet\nvolatile sense of comfort.Jessica\u2019s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a\ngigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no\nimpression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the\nslightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it\nfinally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink\nleaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward\nunderstanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness\nbefore her", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Upon all sides the outer leaves\ngradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still\ndownward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted\nlily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely\napparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered\nover these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came\nthrough them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at\nits disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her\ndim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.It seemed\nweeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her\nwas the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending\nfrom it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at\nit.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at\nall.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of\na man\u2019s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,\nand thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not\nto be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light\nflashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.They are ready at once to denounce the whole medical system\nas a fraud, and become victims of the first \"new system\" or healing fad\nthat is plausibly presented to them.And here a question arises that is puzzling to many.If these systems are\nfads and frauds, why do they so rapidly get and retain so large a\nfollowing among intelligent people?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.The\nquacks of these fad schools get their cures, as every intelligent doctor\nof the old schools knows, in the same way and upon the same principle that\nis so important a factor in medical practice, _i.e._, _faith cure_--the\npsychic effect of the thing done, whether it be the giving of a dose of\nmedicine, a Christian Science pow-wow, the laying on of hands, the\n\"removal of a lesion\" by an Osteopath, the \"adjustment\" of the spine by a\nChiropractor, or what not.The principles of mind or faith cure are legitimately used by the honest\nphysician.Suggestive therapeutics is being systematically studied by many\nwho want to use it with honesty and intelligence.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.They realize fully that\nabuse of this principle figures largely in the maintenance of the shysters\nin their own school, and it is the very foundation of all new schools and\nhealing fads.The people must be made to know this, or fads will continue\nto flourish.The honest physician would be glad to have the people know more than this.He would be glad to have them know enough about symptoms of diseases to\nhave some idea when they really need the help of a physician.For he knows\nthat if the people knew this much all quacks would be speedily put out of\nbusiness.I wonder how many doctors know that observing people are beginning to\nsuspect that many physicians regulate the number of calls they make on a\npatient by motives other than the condition of the patient--size of\npocketbook and the condition of the roads, for instance.I am aware that\nsuch imputation is an insult to any physician worthy of the name, but the\nsad fact is that there are so many, when we count the quacks of all\nschools, unworthy of the name.Louis medical college once said to a large\ngraduating class: \"Young men, don't go to your work with timidity and\ndoubts of your ability to succeed.Look and act your part as physicians,\nand when you have doubts concerning your power over disease _remember\nthis_, ninety-five out of every hundred people who send for you would get\nwell just the same if they never took a drop of your medicine.\"I have\nnever mentioned this to a doctor who did not admit that it is perhaps\ntrue.If so, is there not enough in it alone to explain the apparent\nsuccess of quacks?Again I say there are many noble and brainy physicians, and these have\nmade practically all the great discoveries, invented all the useful\nappliances, written all the great books for other schools to study, and\nthey should have credit from the people for all this, and not be\nmisrepresented by little pretenders.Their teachings should be applied as\nthey gave them.The best of them to-day would have the people taught that\na physician's greatest work may be done in preventing rather than in\ncuring disease.Physicians of the Osler type would like to have the people\nunderstand how little potency drugs have to cure many dangerous diseases\nwhen they have a firm hold on the system.They would have some of the\nresponsibility removed from the shoulders of the physician by having the\npeople understand how much they may do by hygienic living and common-sense\nuse of natural remedies.But the conscientious doctor too often has to compete with the pretender\nwho wants the people to believe that _he_ is their hope and their\nsalvation, and in him they must trust.He wants them to believe that he\nhas a specific remedy for every disease that will go \"right to the spot\"\nand have the desired effect.People who believe this, and believe that\nwithout doctoring the patient could never get well, will sometimes try, or\nsee their neighbors try, a doctor of a \"new school.\"When they see about\nthe same proportion of sick recover, they conclude, of course, that the\ndoctor of the \"new school\" cured them, and is worthy to be forever after\nintrusted with every case of disease that may arise in their families.This is often brought about by the shyster M.D.overreaching himself by\ndiagnosing some simple affection as something very dangerous, in order to\nhave the greater credit in curing it.But he at times overestimates the\nconfidence of the family in his ability.They are ready to believe that\nthe patient's condition is critical, and in terror, wanting the help of\neverything that promises help, call in a doctor of some \"new school\"\nbecause neighbors told how he performed wonderful cures in their families.When the patient recovers speedily, as he would have done with no\ntreatment of any kind, and just as the shyster M.D.thought he would, the\nglory and credit of curing a \"bad case\" of a \"dangerous disease\" go to the\nnew system instead of redounding to the glory of Dr.Shyster, as he\nplanned it would.Is it any wonder true physicians sometimes get disgusted with their\nprofession when they see a shyster come into the town where they have\nworked for years, patiently and conscientiously building up a legitimate\npractice that begins to promise a decent living, and by such quack methods\nas diagnosing cases of simple fever, such as might come from acute\nindigestion or too much play in children, as something dangerous, typhoid\nor \"threatened typhoid,\" or cases of congestion of the lungs as \"lung\nfever,\" and by \"aborting\" or \"curing\" these terrible diseases in short\norder and having his patients out in a few days, jumps into fame and\n(financial) success at a bound?Because the typhoid (real typhoid)\npatients of the honest doctor lingered for weeks and sometimes died, and\nbecause frequently he lost a case of real pneumonia, he made but a poor\nshowing in comparison with the new doctor.\"He's just fresh from school,\nyou know, from a post-graduate course in the East.\"Or, \"He's been to the\nold country and _knows_ something.\"Just as if any physician, though he\nmay have been out of school for many years, does not, or may not, know of\nall the curative agencies of demonstrated merit!Would a medical journal fail to keep its readers posted concerning any new\ndiscovery in medicine, or helpful appliance that promises real good to the\nprofession?<|begin_of_text|>John left the football there.Yet people speak of one doctor's superior knowledge of the\nbest treatment of a particular disease as if that doctor had access to\nsome mysterious source of therapeutic knowledge unknown to other\nphysicians.It is becoming less easy to work the \"dangerous diagnosis\"\ngraft than formerly, for many people are learning that certain diseases\nmust \"run their course,\" and that there are no medicines that have\nspecific curative effects on them.There is another graft now that is taking the place of the one just\nmentioned, to some extent at least.In the hands of a fellow with lots of\nnerve and little conscience it is the greatest of them all.This is the\ngraft of the smart young fellow direct from a post-graduate course in the\nclinics of some great surgeon.He comes to town with a great flourish of trumpets.Of course, he observes\nthe ethics of the profession!The long accounts of his superior education\nand unusual experience with operative surgery are only legitimate items of\nnews for the local papers.It is only right that such an\nunusual doctor should have so much attention.There is no \"starving time\" for him.No weary wait of years for patients\nto come.At one bound he leaps into fame and fortune by performing \"big\noperations\" right and left, when before his coming such cases were only\noccasionally found, and then taken to surgeons of known ability and\nexperience.The reputable physician respects surgery, and would respect\nthe bright young fellow fresh from contact with the latest approved\nmethods who has nerve to undertake the responsibility of a dangerous\noperation when such an operation is really indicated.But when it comes to\nmutilating the human body by cutting away an appendix or an ovary because\nit is known that to remove them when neither they nor the victim are much\ndiseased is a comparatively safe and very _quick_ way to get a big\nreputation--that is the limit of quackery.And no wonder such a man is so\ncordially hated by his brethren.He not always hated because he mutilates\nhumanity so much, as because his spectacular graft in surgery is sure to\nbe taken as proof conclusive that he is superior in all other departments\nof therapeutics.And it puzzles observing laymen sometimes to know why all the successful\n(?)operations are considered such desirable items of news, while the\ncases that are not flattering in their outcome pass unmentioned.I find most complete corroboration of my contention in the president's\naddress, delivered before the Western Surgical and Gynecological\nAssociation at St.Louis, in 1907, by Charles W. Oviatt, M.D.This address\nwas published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, and I\nherewith reprint it in part:\n\n    \"The ambitious medical student does not usually get far into college\n    work before he aspires to become a surgeon.He sees in the surgical\n    clinics more definite and striking results than are discernible in\n    other branches.Without being able to judge of his own relative\n    fitness or whether he possesses the special aptitude so essential to\n    success, he decides to become a surgeon.There will always be room for\n    the young surgeon who, fitted by nature for the work, takes the time\n    and opportunity to properly prepare himself.There is more good\n    surgery being done to-day than ever before, and there are more good\n    surgeons being educated to do the work.If, however, the surgeon of\n    the future is to hold the high and honorable position our leaders have\n    held in the past, there must be some standard of qualification\n    established that shall protect the people against incompetency and\n    dishonesty in surgeons.\"That there is much that passes under the name of surgery being done\n    by ill-trained, incompetent men, will not be denied.What standard,\n    then, should be established, and what requirement should be made\n    before one should be permitted to do surgery?In his address as\n    chairman of the Section on Surgery and Anatomy of the American Medical\n    Association, at the Portland (1905) meeting, Dr.Maurice H. Richardson\n    deals with this subject in such a forceful, clear-cut way, that I take\n    the liberty to quote him at some length:\n\n        \"'The burden of the following remarks is that those only should\n        practice surgery who by education in the laboratory, in the\n        dissecting-room, by the bedside, and at the operating-table, are\n        qualified, first, to make reasonably correct deductions from\n        subjective and objective signs; secondly, to give sound advice for\n        or against operations; thirdly, to perform operations skillfully\n        and quickly, and, fourthly, to conduct wisely the after-treatment.\"'The task before me is a serious criticism of what is going on in\n        every community.I do not single out any community or any man.There is in my mind no doubt whatever that surgery is being\n        practiced by those who are incompetent to practice it--by those\n        whose education is imperfect, who lack natural aptitude, whose\n        environment is such that they never can gain that personal\n        experience which alone will really fit them for what surgery means\n        to-day.They are unable to make correct deductions from histories;\n        to predict probable events; to perform operations skillfully, or\n        to manage after-treatment.\"'All surgeons are liable to error, not only in diagnosis, but in\n        the performance of operations based on diagnosis.Such errors must\n        always be expected and included in the contingencies of the\n        practice of medicine and surgery.Doubtless many of my hearers can\n        recall cases of their own in which useless--or worse than\n        useless--operations have been performed.If, however, serious\n        operations are in the hands of men of large experience, such\n        errors will be reduced to a minimum.\"'Many physicians send patients for diagnosis and opinion as to\n        the advisability of operation without telling the consultant that\n        they themselves are to perform the operation.The diagnosis is\n        made and the operation perhaps recommended, when it appears that\n        the operation is to be in incompetent hands.His advice should be\n        conditional that it be carried out only by the competent.Many\n        operations, like the removal of the vermiform appendix in the\n        period of health, the removal of fibroids which are not seriously\n        offending, the removal of gall-stones that are not causing\n        symptoms, are operations of choice rather than of necessity; they\n        are operations which should never be advised unless they are to be\n        performed by men of the greatest skill.Furthermore, many\n        emergency operations, such as the removal of an inflamed appendix\n        and other operations for lesions which are not necessarily\n        fatal--should be forbidden and the patient left to the chances of\n        spontaneous recovery, if the operation proposed is to be performed\n        by an incompetent.\"'And is not the surgeon, appreciating his own unfitness in spite\n        of years of devotion, in the position to condemn those who lightly\n        take up such burdens without preparation and too often without\n        conscience?\"'In view of these facts, who should perform surgery?How shall\n        the surgeon be best fitted for these grave duties?As a matter of\n        right and wrong, who shall, in the opinion of the medical\n        profession, advise and perform these responsible acts and who\n        shall not?Surgical operations should be performed only by those\n        who are educated for that special purpose.\"'I have no hesitation in saying that the proper fitting of a man\n        for surgical practice requires a much longer experience as a\n        student and assistant than the most exacting schools demand.A man\n        should serve four, five or six years as assistant to an active\n        surgeon.During this period of preparation, as it were, as much\n        time as possible should be given to observing the work of the\n        masters of surgery throughout the world.'Richardson's ideal may seem almost utopian, there being so\n    wide a difference between the standard he would erect and the one\n    generally established, we must all agree that however impossible of\n    attainment under present conditions, such an ideal is none too high\n    and its future realization not too much to hope for.\"While there is being done enough poor surgery that is honest and well\n    intended, there is much being done that is useless, conscienceless,\n    and done for purely commercial ends.This is truly a disagreeable and\n    painful topic and one that I would gladly pass by, did I not feel that\n    its importance demands some word of condemnation coming through such\n    representative surgical organizations as this.\"The spirit of graft that has pervaded our ranks, especially here in\n    the West, is doing much to lower the standard and undermine the morals\n    and ethics of the profession.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.When fee-splitting and the paying of\n    commissions for surgical work began to be heard of something like a\n    decade ago, it seemed so palpably dishonest and wrong that it was\n    believed that it would soon die out, or be at least confined to the\n    few in whom the inherited commercial instinct was so strong that they\n    could not get away from it.But it did not die; on the other hand, it\n    has grown and flourished.\"In looking for an explanation for the existence of this evil, I think\n    several factors must be taken into account, among them being certain\n    changes in our social and economic conditions.This is an age of\n    commercialism.We are known to the world as a nation of \"dollar\n    chasers,\" where nearly everything that should contribute to right\n    living is sacrificed to the Moloch of money.The mad rush for wealth\n    which has characterized the business world, has in a way induced some\n    medical men, whether rightfully or wrongfully, to adopt the same\n    measures in self-protection.The patient or his friends too often\n    insist on measuring the value of our services with a commercial\n    yard-stick, the fee to be paid being the chief consideration.In this\n    way the public must come in for its share of responsibility for\n    existing conditions.So long as there are people who care so little\n    who operates on them, just so long will there be cheap surgeons, cheap\n    in every respect, to supply the demand.The demand for better\n    physicians and surgeons must come in part from those who employ their\n    services.\"Another source of the graft evil is the existence of low-grade,\n    irregular and stock-company medical schools.In many of these schools\n    the entrance requirements are not in evidence outside of their\n    catalogues.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.With no standard of character or ethics, these schools\n    turn out men who have gotten the little learning they possess in the\n    very atmosphere of graft.The existence of these schools seems less\n    excusable when we consider that our leading medical colleges rank with\n    the best in the world and are ample for the needs of all who should\n    enter the profession.Their constant aim is to still further elevate\n    the standard and to admit as students only those who give unmistakable\n    evidence of being morally and intellectually fit to become members of\n    the profession.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.\"Enough men of character, however, are entering the field through\n    these better schools to ensure the upholding of those lofty ideals\n    that have characterized the profession in the past and which are\n    essential to our continued progress.I think, therefore, that we may\n    take a hopeful view of the future.The demand for better prepared\n    physicians will eventually close many avenues that are now open to\n    students, greatly to the benefit of all.With the curtailing of the\n    number of students and a less fierce competition which this will\n    bring, there will be less temptation, less necessity, if you will, on\n    the part of general practitioners to ask for a division of fees.He\n    will come to see that honest dealing on his part with the patient\n    requiring special skill will in the long run be the best policy.He\n    will make a just, open charge for the services he has rendered and not\n    attempt to collect a surreptitious fee through a dishonest surgeon for\n    services he has not rendered and could not render.Then, too, there\n    will be less inducement and less opportunity for incompetent and\n    conscienceless men to disgrace the art of surgery.\"The public mind is becoming especially active just at this time in\n    combating graft in all forms, and is ready to aid in its destruction.The intelligent portion of the laity is becoming alive to the patent\n    medicine evil.It is only a question of time when the people will\n    demand that the secular papers which go into our homes shall not\n    contain the vile, disgusting and suggestive quack advertisements that\n    are found to-day.A campaign of reform is being instituted against\n    dishonest politicians, financiers, railroad and insurance magnates,\n    showing that their methods will be no longer tolerated.The moral\n    standards set for professional men and men in public life are going to\n    be higher in the future, and with the limelight of public opinion\n    turned on the medical and surgical grafter, the evil will cease to\n    exist.Hand in hand with this reform let us hope that there will come\n    to be established a legal and moral standard of qualification for\n    those who assume to do surgery.\"I feel sure that it is the wish of every member of this association\n    to do everything possible to hasten the coming of this day and to aid\n    in the uplifting of the art of surgery.Our individual effort in this\n    direction must lie largely through the influence we exert over those\n    who seek our advice before beginning the study of medicine, and over\n    those who, having entered the work, are to follow in our immediate\n    footsteps.To the young man who seeks our counsel as to the\n    advisability of commencing the study of medicine, it is our duty to\n    make a plain statement of what would be expected of him, of the cost\n    in time and money, and an estimate of what he might reasonably expect\n    as a reward for a life devoted to ceaseless study, toil and\n    responsibility.If, from our knowledge of the character, attainments\n    and qualifications of the young man we feel that at best he could make\n    but a modicum of success in the work, we should endeavor to divert his\n    ambition into some other channel.\"We should advise the 'expectant surgeon' in his preparation to follow\n    as nearly as possible the line of study suggested by Richardson.Then\n    I would add the advice of Senn, viz: 'To do general practice for\n    several years, return to laboratory work and surgical anatomy, attend\n    the clinics of different operators, and never cease to be a physician.If this advice is followed there will be less unnecessary operating\n    done in the future than has been the case in the past.'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.The young man\n    who enters special work without having had experience as a general\n    practitioner, is seriously handicapped.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.In this age, when we have so\n    frequently to deal with the so-called border-line cases, it is\n    especially well never to cease being a physician.\"We would next have the young man assure himself that he is the\n    possessor of a well-developed, healthy, working'surgical conscience.'No matter how well qualified he may be, his enthusiasm in the earlier\n    years of his work will lead him to do operations that he would refrain\n    from in later life.He knows that early and thorough radical measures alone hold out hope,\n    and only by repeated unsuccessful efforts will he learn to temper his\n    ambition by the judgment that comes of experience.Pirogoff, the noted\n    surgeon, suffered from a malignant growth.Billroth refused to operate\n    or advise operation.In writing to another surgeon friend he said: 'I\n    am not the bold operator whom you knew years ago in Zurich.Before\n    deciding on the necessity of an operation, I always propose to myself\n    this question: Would you permit such an operation as you intend\n    performing on your patient to be done on yourself?Years and\n    experience bring in their train a certain degree of hesitancy.'This,\n    coming from one who in his day was the most brilliant operator in the\n    world, should be remembered by every surgeon, young and old.\"In the hands of the skilled,\nconscientious surgeon how great are thy powers for good to suffering\nhumanity!In the hands of shysters \"what crimes are committed in thy\nname!\"With his own school full of shysters and incompetents, and grafters of\n\"new schools\" and \"systems\" to compete with on every hand, the\nconscientious physician seems to be \"between the devil and the deep sea!\"With quacks to the right of him, quacks to the left of him, quacks in\nfront of him, all volleying and thundering with their literature to prove\nthat the old schools, and all schools other than theirs, are frauds,\nimpostors and poisoners, about all that is left for the layman to do when\nsick is to take to the woods.PART TWO\n\nOSTEOPATHY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.Romantic Story of Osteopathy's Origin--An Asthma Cure--Headache Cured\n    by Plowlines--Log Rolling to Relieve Dysentery--Osteopathy is Drugless\n    Healing--Osteopathy is Manual Treatment--Liberty of Blood, Nerves and\n    Arteries--Perfect Skeletal Alignment and Tonic, Ligamentous, Muscular\n    and Facial Relaxation--Andrew T. Still in 1874--Kirksville, Mo., as a\n    Mecca--American School of Osteopathy--The Promised Golden Stream of\n    Prosperity--Shams and Pretenses--The \"Mossbacks\"--\"Who's Who in\n    Osteopathy.\"The story of the origin of Osteopathy is romantic enough to appeal to the\nfancy of impressionists.It is almost as romantic as the finding of the\nmysterious stones by the immortal Joe Smith.In this story is embodied the\nlife history of an old-time doctor and pioneer hero in his restless\nmigrations about the frontiers of Kansas and Missouri.His thrilling\nexperiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are\nnarrated, and how the germ of the idea of the true cause and cure of\ndisease was planted in his mind by the remark of a comrade as the two lay\nconcealed in a thicket for days to escape border ruffians.Then, later,\nhow the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom\nall his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had\nbeen powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that\ndrugs could cure disease.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.He believed Nature had a true system, and for\nthis he began a patient search.He wandered here and there, almost in the\ncondition of the religious reformers of old, who \"wandered up and down\nclad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy.\"In\nthe name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he\nmight read from his red bones some clue to the secret.One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to\nthe discovery of the \"great truth.\"It states that by accidentally curing\na case of asthma by \"fooling with the bones of the chest,\" he was led to\nthe belief that bones out of normal position cause disease.Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing\nof late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics.In this\nmagazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by\ncuring a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing\nmade of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a\nlog to relieve the pain of dysentery.Accidentally the \"lesion\" was\ncorrected, or the proper center \"inhibited,\" and his headache and flux\nimmediately cured.You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful\ndiscovery.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to\ninquire \"What is it?\"its leading promoters have vied with each other in\ntrying to construct a good definition for their \"great new science.\"Here are some of the definitions:\n\n\"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing.\"For a genuine \"lesion\"\nOsteopath that would not do at all.It is too broad and gives too much\nscope to the physicians who would do more than \"pull bones.\"\"Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and\nscientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease.\"That definition\nsuits better, because of the \"manual treatment.\"If you are a true\nOsteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any\nmechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression\nthat you are \"handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who\nknows every part of his machine.\"\"The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that\nit may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,\nnerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination.\"This\ndefinition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we\nwonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same\neffect.\"Liberty of blood\" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must\nadmit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or\nhot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate\ncirculation, is rational.But when \"liberty of blood\" is mentioned, what\nis meant by \"liberty of arteries\"?\"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic\nligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation.\"Some Osteopaths and other\ntherapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used\n\"big words\" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of\nthe one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,\ntechnical terms and \"high-sounding nothings\" used by so many Osteopathic\nwriters.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,\nPh.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general\npublic in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify\ngreat truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If\nwriters for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying\nand popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on\nOsteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary\nis taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and\nmotives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading\npromoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be\nwithheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in\nKansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He\nwas at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.During the Civil War\nhe was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the\nwar that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something\nnatural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by\nhis profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the\ndiscovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of\nKirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had\nimplicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious\nmovements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn\ntoward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's\nhealing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,\nwhich from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and\nequipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated\nyearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been\nfounded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number\nof schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the\ncountry.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and\nthis number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians\nthan are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic\nreports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable\nlegal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I\nshall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and\nwomen who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater\nimportance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide\nwhich system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their\nlives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one\ninjustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the\ncause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents\nthe sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of\ntelling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this \"new science\" of\nhealing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes\nbold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of\npractitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy\nfor disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of\nOsteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that\nsince the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are\nso blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the\npractice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic\ncollege that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim\nmyself as an exponent of a \"complete and well-rounded system of healing,\nadequate for every emergency,\" as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the\njournals published for \"Osteopathic physicians\" to scatter broadcast among\nthe people.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an\nOsteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility\nfor human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the\ncase as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy\nwould cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been\ncalled a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not\npractice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and \"subluxated,\" and", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "In\nconsequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the\nliterature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to\nall \"Osteopathic physicians\" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies\nof Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with\nsome of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor\nof an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This\neditor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in\nwhich he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,\nas I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as\nhe acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I\nbelieve, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been\ndiscouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am\nwriting.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I\nbelieve, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large\nnumber of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all\nthat makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say\nthat they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing\nnumber.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of\nthe small per cent.It may not be\nknown how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in\nthe meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a\nstore, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic\nphysicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no\nreason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who\nhave quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,\nstarted out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was\npointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath\nfrom the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance\nbill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a\nchain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,\nabout eight hundred of them, of \"mossbacks,\" as we were politely called.I\nsay \"we,\" for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the\nnames of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could\nbe had with them.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.Just for what, aside\nfrom the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not\nclear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,\nand do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals\nare continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the\n\"Who's Who in Osteopathy\" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is\nnot strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic\njournals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those\nwho choose Osteopathy

in Exact Proportion to Advertising\n    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous\n    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine\n    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic\n    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of\n    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The\n    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as \"Professor\"--The Lure of\n    \"Honored Doctor\" with \"Big Income\"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in\npopularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them\nintelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to\nfollow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and\npopularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing\nsystem.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people\nare so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The \"perfect\nadjustment,\" \"perfect functioning\" theory of Osteopathy is especially\nattractive to people made ripe for some \"drugless healing\" system by\ncauses already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of\nall manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative\npowers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such\ngood results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will\nestablish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and\nholds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,\ntaught as \"a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,\"\nhas grown and spread largely as a \"patent medicine\" flourishes, _i.e._,\nin exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not\npresume to make this statement as merely my opinion.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.The question at issue\nis too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present\nfacts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.Every week I get booklets or \"sample copies\" of journals heralding the\nwonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as\njournals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by\nthe hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution\nby these patients to their friends.The publishers of these \"boosters\"\nsay, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their\npractice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of\nthese journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:\n\n    \"Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me\n    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite\n    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their\n    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter\nopposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it\nbecause \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\"At one time I honestly\nbelieved this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic\nauthority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract\nfrom a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic\nAssociation:\n\n    \"Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at\n    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of\n    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our\n    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which\n    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe\n    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its\n    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized\n    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._\n    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your\n    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your\n    own limitations_?\"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we\nhave boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: \"Curbing our\nlimitations\" and \"sounding your own limitations.\"But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body \"_our\ndeath knell begins to sound_,\" indicate that Osteopathic leaders are\ncontent to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science\ndepends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he\nsaid, \"Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of\nOsteopathy as an independent system\"?If truth always grows under\npersecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when\nit is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where\nthey have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of\ninvalids every day.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic\njournals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends\nupon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was\ndemonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the\nbenefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its\nmerits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly\na _name_, and \"lives, moves, and has its being\" in boosting?It seems to\nhave been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have\npublished again and again the nice things a number of governors said when\nthey signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State\nauthority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a\nchampion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.Mark Twain once went\nup to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to\nresist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed\nMark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned\nhistory of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a\nchampion of the \"under dog in the fight.\"Lately he has gone on the\nwarpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond\ndelusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll\nSouthern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and\nboldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have\ntossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to\nbe promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his \"Heart's Desire.\"There may have been \"method in his madness,\" for that Osteopathic horse\ndoctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam\nsaid, \"There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as\nbetween playing a piano and currying a horse.\"The idea of comparing the\nOsteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the\npianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that\npreachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors\nwhen they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.They can be excused on\nthe ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of \"struggling\ntruth.\"But what shall we say of medical men, some of them of reputation\nand great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such\nconditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or\npolicy?<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.Osteopathic journals have made much of an article written by a famous\n\"orificial surgeon.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.The article appears on the first page of a leading\nOsteopath journal, and is headed, \"An Expert Opinion on Osteopathy.\"Among\nthe many good things he says of the \"new science\" is this: \"The full\nbenefit of a single sitting can be secured in from three to ten minutes\ninstead of an hour or more, as required by massage.\"I shall discuss the\ntime of an average Osteopathic treatment further on, but I should like to\nsee how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath\nand treated from three to ten minutes.He also says that \"Osteopathy is so beneficial to cases of insanity that\nit seems quite probable that this large class of terrible sufferers may be\nalmost emancipated from their hell.\"I shall also say more further on of\nwhat I know of Osteopathy's record as an insanity cure.There is this\nsignificant thing in connection with this noted specialist's boost for\nOsteopathy.The journal printing this article comments on it in another\nnumber; tells what a great man the specialist is, and incidentally lets\nOsteopaths know that if any of them want to add a knowledge of \"orificial\nsurgery\" to their \"complete science,\" this doctor is the man from whom to\nget it, as he is the \"great and only\" in his specialty, and is big and\nbroad enough to appreciate Osteopathy.The most despicable booster of any new system of therapeutics is the\nphysician who becomes its champion to get a job as \"professor\" in one of\nits colleges.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the milk.Of course it is a strong temptation to a medical man who has\nnever made much of a reputation in his own profession.You may ask, \"Have there been many such medical men?\"Consult the faculty\nrolls of the colleges of these new sciences, and you will be surprised, no\ndoubt, to find how many put M.D.Some of these were honest converts to the system, perhaps.Some wanted\nthe honor of being \"Professor Doctor,\" maybe, and some may have been lured\nby the same bait that attracts so many students into Osteopathic colleges.That is, the positive assurance of \"plenty of easy money\" in it.One who has studied the real situation in an effort to learn why\nOsteopathy has grown so fast as a profession, can hardly miss the\nconclusion that advertising keeps the grist of students pouring into\nOsteopathic mills.There is scarcely a corner of the United States that\ntheir seductive literature does not reach.Practitioners in the field are\ncontinually reminded by the schools from which they graduated that their\nalma mater looks largely to their solicitations to keep up the supply of\nrecruits.Their advertising, the tales of wonderful cures and big money made, appeal\nto all classes.It seems that none are too scholarly and none too ignorant\nto become infatuated with the idea of becoming an \"honored doctor\" with a\n\"big income.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.College professors and preachers have been lured from\ncomfortable positions to become Osteopaths.Shrewd traveling men, seduced\nby the picture of a permanent home, have left the road to become\nOsteopathic physicians and be \"rich and honored.\"To me, when a student of Osteopathy, it was\npathetic and almost tragic to observe the crowds of men and women who had\nbeen seduced from spheres of drudging usefulness, such as clerking,\nteaching, barbering, etc., to become money-making doctors.In their old\ncallings they had lost all hope of gratifying ambition for fame and\nfortune, but were making an honest living.The rosy pictures of honor,\nfame and twenty dollars per day, that the numerous Osteopathic circulars\nand journals painted, were not to be withstood.These circulars told them that the fields into which they might go and\nreap that $20 per day were unlimited.They said: \"There are dozens of\nministers ready to occupy each vacant pulpit, and as many applicants for\neach vacancy in the schools.Each hamlet has four or five doctors, where\nit can support but one.The legal profession is filled to the starving\npoint.Young licentiates in the older professions all have to pass through\na starving time.The\npicture was a rosy dream of triumphant success!When they had mastered the\ngreat science and become \"Doctors of Osteopathy,\" the world was waiting\nwith open arms and pocketbooks to receive them.THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHY.Infallible, Touch-the-Button System that Always

had staked\ntheir little all on this last venture, and what was before them if they\nshould fail heaven only knew.How eagerly they looked forward to the time\nwhen they should have struggled through the lessons in anatomy, chemistry,\nphysiology, symptomatology and all the rest, and should be ready to\nreceive the wonderful principles of Osteopathy they were to apply in\nperforming the miraculous cures that were to make them wealthy and famous.Need I tell the physician who was a conscientious student of anatomy in\nhis school days, that there was disappointment when the time came to enter\nthe class in \"theory and practice\" of Osteopathy?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.There had been vague ideas of a systematized, infallible, touch-the-button\nsystem that _always_ cured.Instead, we were instructed in a lot of\nindefinite movements and manipulations that somehow left us speculating as\nto just how much of it all was done for effect.We had heard so often that Osteopathy was a complete satisfying science\n_that did things specifically_!Now it began to dawn upon us that there\nwas indeed a \"wealth of undeveloped scientific facts\" in Osteopathy, as\nthose glittering circulars had said when they thought to attract young men\nambitious for original research.They had said, \"Much yet remains to be\ndiscovered.\"Some of us wondered if the \"undeveloped\" and \"undiscovered\"\nscientific facts were not the main constituents of the \"science.\"The students expected something exact and tangible, and how eagerly they\ngrasped at anything in the way of bringing quick results in curing the\nsick.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple there.If Osteopathy is so complete, why did so many students, after they had\nreceived everything the learned (?)professors had to impart, procure\nJuettner's \"Modern Physio-Therapy\" and Ling's \"Manual Therapy\" and Rosse's\n\"Cures Without Drugs\" and Kellogg's work on \"Hydrotherapy\"?They felt that\nthey needed all they could get.It was customary for the students to begin \"treating\" after they had been\nin school a few months, and medical men will hardly be surprised to know\nthat they worked with more faith in their healing powers and performed\nmore wonderful (?)<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.cures in their freshman year than they ever did\nafterward.I have in mind a student, one of the brightest I ever met, who read a\ncheap book on Osteopathic practice, went into a community where he was\nunknown, and practiced as an Osteopathic physician.In a few months he had\nmade enough money to pay his way through an Osteopathic college, which he\nentered professing to believe that Osteopathy would cure all the ills\nflesh is heir to, but which he left two years later to take a medical\ncourse.degree, but I notice that it is his M.D.Can students be blamed for getting a little weak in faith when men who\ntold them that the great principles of Osteopathy were sufficient to cure\n_everything_, have been known to backslide so far as to go and take\nmedical courses themselves?How do you suppose it affects students of an Osteopathic college to read\nin a representative journal that the secretary of their school, and the\ngreatest of all its boosters, calls medical men into his own family when\nthere is sickness in it?There are many men and women practicing to-day who try to be honest and\nconscientious, and by using all the good in Osteopathy, massage, Swedish\nmovements, hydrotherapy, and all the rest of the adjuncts of\nphysio-therapy, do a great deal of good.The practitioner who does use\nthese agencies, however, is denounced by the stand-patters as a \"drifter.\"They say he is not a true Osteopath, but a mongrel who is belittling the\ngreat science.That circular letter from the secretary of the American\nOsteopathic Association said that one of the greatest needs of\norganization was to preserve Osteopathy in its primal purity as it came\nfrom its founder, A. T. Still.If our medical brethren and the laity could read some of the acrimonious\ndiscussions on the question of using adjuncts, they would certainly be\nimpressed with the exactness (?)<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.There is one idea of Osteopathy that even the popular mind has grasped,\nand that is that it is essentially finding \"lesions\" and correcting them.Yet the question has been very prominent and pertinent among Osteopaths:\n\"Are you a lesion Osteopath?\"Think of it, gentlemen, asking an Osteopath\nif he is a \"lesionist\"!Yet there are plenty of Osteopaths who are stupid\nenough (or honest enough) not to be able to find bones \"subluxed\" every\ntime they look at a patient.Practitioners who really want to do their\npatrons good will use adjuncts even if they are denounced by the\nstand-patters.I believe every conscientious Osteopath must sometimes feel that it is\nsafer to use rational remedies than to rely on \"bone setting,\" or\n\"inhibiting a center,\" but for the grafter it is not so spectacular and\ninvolves more hard work.The stand-patters of the American Osteopathic Association have not\neliminated all trouble when they get Osteopaths to stick to the \"bone\nsetting, inhibiting\" idea.The chiropractic man threatens to steal their\nthunder here.The Chiropractor has found that when it comes to using\nmysterious maneuvers and manipulations as bases for mind cure, one thing\nis about as good as another, except that the more mysterious a thing\nlooks the better it works.So the Chiropractor simply gives his healing\n\"thrusts\" or his wonderful \"adjustments,\" touches the buttons along the\nspine as it were, when--presto!disease has flown before his healing touch\nand blessed health has come to reign instead!The Osteopath denounces the Chiropractor as a brazen fraud who has stolen\nall that is good in Chiropractics (if there _is_ anything good) from\nOsteopathy.But Chiropractics follows so closely what the \"old liner\"\ncalls the true theory of Osteopathy that, between him and the drifter who\ngives an hour of crude massage, or uses the forbidden accessories, the\ntrue Osteopath has a hard time maintaining the dignity (?)of Osteopathy\nand keeping its practitioners from drifting.Some of the most ardent supporters of true Osteopathy I have ever known\nhave drifted entirely away from it.After practicing two or three years,\nabusing medicine and medical men all the time, and proclaiming to the\npeople continually that they had in Osteopathy all that a sick world could\never need, it is suddenly learned that the \"Osteopath is gone.\"He has\n\"silently folded his tent and stolen away,\" and where has he gone?He has\ngone to a medical college to study that same medicine he has so\nindustriously abused while he was gathering in the shekels as an\nOsteopath.Going to learn and practice the science he has so persistently\ndenounced as a fraud and a curse to humanity.The intelligent, conscientious Osteopath who dares to brave the scorn of\nthe stand-patter and use all the legitimate adjuncts of Osteopathy found\nin physio-therapy, may do a great deal of good as a physician.I have\nfound many physicians willing to acknowledge this, and even recommend the\nservices of such an Osteopath when physio-therapy was indicated.When a physician, however, meets a fellow who claims to have in his\nOsteopathy a wonderful system, complete and all-sufficient to cope with\nany and all diseases, and that his system is founded on a knowledge of the\nrelation and function of the various parts and organs of the body such as\nno other school of therapeutics has ever been able to discover, then he\nknows that he has met a man of the same mental and moral calibre as the\nshyster in his own school.He knows he has met a fellow who is exploiting\na thing, that may be good in its way and place, as a graft.And he knows\nthat this grafter gets his wonderful cures largely as any other quack gets\nhis; the primary effects of his \"scientific manipulations\" are on the\nminds of those treated.The intelligent physician knows that the Osteopath got his boastedly\nsuperior knowledge of anatomy mostly from the same text-books and same\nclass of cadavers that other physicians had to master if they graduated\nfrom a reputable school.All that talk we have heard so much about the\nOsteopaths being the \"finest anatomists in the world\" sounds plausible,\nand is believed by the laity generally.The quotation I gave above has been much used in Osteopathic literature\nas coming from an eminent medical man.What foundation is there for such a\nbelief?The Osteopath _may_ be a good anatomist.He has about the same\nopportunities to learn anatomy the medical student has.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.If he is a good\nand conscientious student he may consider his anatomy of more importance\nthan does the medical student who is not expecting to do much surgery.If\nhe is a natural shyster and shirk he can get through a course in\nOsteopathy and get his diploma, and this diploma may be about the only\nproof he could ever give that he is a \"superior anatomist.\"Great stress has always been laid by Osteopaths upon the amount of study\nand research done by their students on the cadaver.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the apple there.I want to give you\nsome specimens of the learning of the man (an M.D.)who presided over the\ndissecting-room when I pursued my \"profound research\" on the \"lateral\nhalf.\"This great man, whose superior knowledge of anatomy, I presume,\ninduced by the wise management of the college to employ him as a\ndemonstrator, in an article written for the organ of the school expresses\nhimself thus:\n\n    \"It is needless to say that the first impression of an M. D. would not\n    be favorable to Osteopathy, because he has spent years fixing in his\n    mind that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it, but\n    give a man morphine or something of the same character with an\n    external blister or hot application and in a week or ten days he would\n    be all right.In the meanwhile watch the patient's general health,\n    relieve the induced constipation by suitable means and rearrange what\n    he has disarranged in his treatment.On the other hand, let the\n    Osteopath get hold of this patient, and with his _vast_ and we might\n    say _perfect_ knowledge of anatomy, he at once, with no other tools\n    than his hands, inhibits the nerves supplying the affected parts, and\n    in five minutes the patient can freely move his head and shoulders,\n    entirely relieved from pain.Would\n    he not feel like wiping off the earth with all the Osteopaths?Doctor,\n    with your medical education a course in Osteopathy would teach you\n    that it is not necessary to subject your patients to myxedema by\n    removing the thyroid gland to cure goitre.You would not have to lie\n    awake nights studying means to stop one of those troublesome bowel\n    complaints in children, nor to insist upon the enforced diet in\n    chronic diarrhea, and a thousand other things which are purely\n    physiological and are not done by any magical presto change, but by\n    methods which are perfectly rational if you will only listen long\n    enough to have them explained to you.I will agree that at first\n    impression all methods look alike to the medical man, but when\n    explained by an intelligent teacher they will bring their just\n    reward.\"Gentlemen of the medical profession, study the above\ncarefully--punctuation, composition, profound wisdom and all.Surely you\ndid not read it when it was given to the world a few years ago, or you\nwould all have been converted to Osteopathy then, and the medical\nprofession left desolate.We have heard many bad things of medical men,\nbut never (until we learned it from one who was big-brained enough to\naccept Osteopathy when its great truths dawned upon him) did we know that\nyou are so dull of intellect that it takes you \"years to fix in your minds\nthat if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it but to give a\nman morphine.\"And how pleased Osteopaths are to learn from this scholar that the\nOsteopath can \"take hold\" of a case of torticollis, \"and with his vast and\nwe might say perfect knowledge of anatomy\" inhibit the nerves and have the\nman cured in five minutes.We were glad to learn this great truth from\nthis learned ex-M.D., as we never should have known, otherwise, that\nOsteopathy is so potent.I have had cases of torticollis in my practice, and thought I had done\nwell if after a half hour of hard work massaging contracted muscles I had\nbenefited the case.And note the relevancy of these questions, \"Would not the medical man be\nangry?Would he not feel like wiping off the earth all the Osteopaths?\"Gentlemen, can you explain your ex-brother's meaning here?Surely you are\nnot all so hard-hearted that you would be angry because a poor wry-necked\nfellow had been cured in five minutes.To be serious, I ask you to think of \"the finest anatomists in the world\"\ndoing their \"original research\" work in the dissecting-room under the\ndirection of a man of the scholarly attainments indicated by the\ncomposition and thought of the above article.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Do you see now how\nOsteopaths get a \"vast and perfect knowledge of anatomy\"?Do you suppose that the law of \"the survival of the fittest\" determines\nwho continues in the practice of Osteopathy and succeeds?Is it true worth\nand scholarly ability that get a big reputation of success among medical\nmen?I know, and many medical men know from competition with him (if they\nwould admit that such a fellow may be a competitor), that the ignoramus\nwho as a physician is the product of a diploma mill often has a bigger\nreputation and performs more wonderful cures (?)than the educated\nOsteopath who really mastered the prescribed course but is too\nconscientious to assume responsibility for human life when he is not sure\nthat he can do all that might be done to save life.I once met an Osteopath whose literary attainments had never reached the\nrudiments of an education.He had never really comprehended a single\nlesson of his entire course.He told me that he was then on a vacation to\nget much-needed rest.He had such a large practice that the physical labor\nof it was wearing him out.I knew of this fellow's qualifications, but I\nthought he might be one of those happy mortals who have the faculty of\n\"doing things,\" even if they cannot learn the theory.To learn the secret\nof this fellow's success, if I could, I let him treat me.I had some\ncontracted muscles that were irritating nerves and holding joints in tense\ncondition, a typical case, if there are any, for an Osteopathic treatment.I expected him to do some of that\n\"expert Osteopathic diagnosing\" that you have heard of, but he began in an\naimless desultory way, worked almost an hour, found nothing specific, did\nnothing but give me a poor unsystematic massage.He was giving me a\n\"popular treatment.\"In many towns people have come to estimate the value of an Osteopathic\ntreatment by its duration.People used to say to me, \"You don't treat as\nlong as Dr.----, who was here before you,\" and say it in a way indicating\nthat they were hardly satisfied they had gotten their money's worth.Some\nof them would say: \"He treated me an hour for seventy-five cents.\"Does it\nseem funny to talk of adjusting lesions on one person for an hour at a\ntime, three times a week?My picture of incompetency and apparent success of incompetents, is not\noverdrawn.The other day I had a marked copy of a local paper from a town\nin California.It was a flattering write-up of an old classmate.The\ndoctor's automobile was mentioned, and he had marked with a cross a fine\nauto shown in a picture of the city garage.This fellow had been\nconsidered by all the Simple Simon of the class, inferior in almost every\nattribute of true manliness, yet now he flourishes as one of those of our\nclass to whose success the school can \"point with pride.\"It is interesting to read the long list of \"changes of location\" among\nOsteopaths, yet between the lines there is a sad story that may be read.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.First, \"Doctor Blank has located\nin Philadelphia, with twenty-five patients for the first month and rapidly\ngrowing practice.\"A year or so after another item tells that \"Doctor\nBlank has located in San Francisco with bright prospects.\"Then \"Doctor\nBlank has returned to Missouri on account of his wife's health, and\nlocated in ----, where he has our best wishes for success.\"Their career\nreminds us of Goldsmith's lines:\n\n  \"As the", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "There has been many a tragic scene enacted upon the Osteopathic stage, but\nthe curtain has not been raised for the public to behold them.How many\ntimid old maids, after saving a few hundred dollars from wages received\nfor teaching school, have been persuaded that they could learn Osteopathy\nwhile their shattered nerves were repaired and they were made young and\nbeautiful once more by a course of treatment in the clinics of the school.Then they would be ready to go out to occupy a place of dignity and honor,\nand treat ten to thirty patients per month at twenty-five dollars per\npatient.Gentlemen of the medical profession, from what you know of the aggressive\nspirit that it takes to succeed in professional life to-day (to say\nnothing of the physical strength required in the practice of Osteopathy),\nwhat per cent.of these timid old maids do you suppose have \"panted to the\nplace from whence at first they flew,\" after leaving their pitiful little\nsavings with the benefactors of humanity who were devoting their splendid\ntalents to the cause of Osteopathy?If any one doubts that some Osteopathic schools are conducted from other\nthan philanthropic motives, let him read what the _Osteopathic Physician_\nsaid of a new school founded in California.Of all the fraud, bare-faced\nshystering, and flagrant rascality ever exposed in any profession, the\ncircumstances of the founding of this school, as depicted by the editor of\nthe _Osteopathic Physician_, furnishes the most disgusting instance.Men\nto whom we had clung when the anchor of our faith in Osteopathy seemed\nabout to drag were held up before us as sneaking, cringing, incompetent\nrascals, whose motives in founding the school were commercial in the worst\nsense.And how do you suppose Osteopaths out in the field of practice feel\nwhen they receive catalogues from the leading colleges that teach their\nsystem, and these catalogues tell of the superior education the colleges\nare equipped to give, and among the pictures of learned members of the\nfaculty they recognize the faces of old schoolmates, with glasses, pointed\nbeards and white ties, silk hats maybe, but the same old classmate\nof--sometimes not ordinary ability.I spoke a moment ago of old maids being induced to believe that they would\nbe made over in the clinics of an Osteopathic college.An Osteopathic journal before me says: \"If it were generally\nknown that Osteopathy has a wonderfully rejuvenating effect upon fading\nbeauty, Osteopathic physicians would be overworked as beauty doctors.\"Another journal says: \"If the aged could know how many years might be\nadded to their lives by Osteopathy, they would not hesitate to avail\nthemselves of treatment.\"A leading D. O. discusses consumption as treated Osteopathically, and\ncloses his discussion with the statement in big letters: \"CONSUMPTION CAN\nBE CURED.\"Another Osteopathic doctor says the curse that was placed upon Mother Eve\nin connection with the propagation of the race has been removed by\nOsteopathy, and childbirth \"positively painless\" is a consummated fact.Asthma\ncured by moving a bone!What more in therapeutics is left to be desired?CHAPTER X.\n\nOSTEOPATHY AS RELATED TO SOME OTHER FAKES.Sure Shot Rheumatism Cure--Regular Practitioner's\n    Discomfiture--Medicines Alone Failed to Cure Rheumatism--Osteopathy\n    Relieves Rheumatic and Neuralgic Pains--\"Move Things\"--\"Pop\" Stray\n    Cervical Vertebrae--Find Something Wrong and Put it Right--Terrible\n    Neck-Wrenching, Bone-Twisting Ordeal.A discussion of graft in connection with doctoring would not be complete\nif nothing were said about the traveling medicine faker.Every summer our\ntowns are visited by smooth-tongued frauds who give free shows on the\nstreets.They harangue the people by the hour with borrowed spiels, full\nof big medical terms, and usually full of abuse of regular practitioners,\nwhich local physicians must note with humiliation is too often received by\npeople without resentment and often with applause.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.Only last summer I was standing by while one of these grafters was making\nhis spiel, and gathering dollars by the pocketful for a \"sure shot\"\nrheumatism cure.His was a _sure_ cure, doubly guaranteed; no cure, money\nall refunded (if you could get it).A physician standing near laughed\nrather a mirthless laugh, and remarked that Barnum was right when he said,\n\"The American people like to be humbugged.\"When the medical man left, a\nman who had just become the happy possessor of enough of the wonderful\nherb to make a quart of the rheumatism router, remarked: \"He couldn't be a\nworse humbug than that old duffer.He doctored me for six weeks, and told\nme all the time that his medicine would cure me in a few days.I got worse\nall the time until I went to Dr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.----, who told me to use a sack of hot\nbran mash on my back, and I was able to get around in two days.\"In this man's remarks there is an explanation of the reason the crowd\nlaughed when they heard the quack abusing the regular practitioner, and of\nthe reason the people handed their hard-earned dollars to the grafter at\nthe rate of forty in ten minutes, by actual count.If all doctors were\nhonest and told the people what all authorities have agreed upon about\nrheumatism, _i.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.e._, that internal medication does it little good, and the\nmain reliance must be on external application, traveling and patent\nmedicine fakers who make a specialty of rheumatism cure would be \"put out\nof business,\" and there would be eliminated one source of much loss of\nfaith in medicine.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.I learned by experience as an Osteopath that many people lose faith in\nmedicine and in the honesty of physicians because of the failure of\nmedicine to cure rheumatism where the physician had promised a cure.Patients afflicted with other diseases get well anyway, or the sexton puts\nthem where they cannot tell people of the physician's failure to cure\nthem.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.The rheumatic patient lives on, and talks on of \"Doc's\" failure to\nstop his rheumatic pains.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.All doctors know that rheumatism is the\nuniversal disease of our fickle climate.If it were not for rheumatic\npains, and neuralgic pains that often come from nerves irritated by\ncontracted muscles, the Osteopath in the average country town would get\nmore lonesome than he does.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.People who are otherwise skeptical concerning\nthe merits of Osteopathy will admit that it seems rational treatment for\nrheumatism.Yet this is a disease that Osteopathy of the specific-adjustment,\nbone-setting, nerve-inhibiting brand has little beneficial effect upon.All the Osteopathic treatments I ever gave or saw given in cases of\nrheumatism that really did any good, were long, laborious massages.The\nmedical man who as \"professor\" in an Osteopathic college said, \"When the\nOsteopath with his _vast_ knowledge of anatomy gets hold of a case of\ntorticollis he inhibits the nerves and cures it in five minutes,\" was\ntalking driveling rot.I have seen some of the best Osteopaths treat wry-neck, and the work they\ndid was to knead and stretch and pull, which by starting circulation and\nworking out soreness, gradually relieved the patient.A hot application,\nby expanding tissues and stimulating circulation, would have had the same\neffect, perhaps more slowly manifested.To call any Osteopathic treatment massage is always resented as an insult\nby the guardians of the science.What is the Osteopath doing, who rolls\nand twists and pulls and kneads for a full hour, if he isn't giving a\nmassage treatment?Of course, it sounds more dignified, and perhaps helps\nto \"preserve the purity of Osteopathy as a separate system,\" to call it\n\"reducing subluxations,\" \"correcting lesions,\" \"inhibiting and\nstimulating\" nerves.The treatment also acts better as a placebo to call\nit by these names.As students we were taught that all Osteopathic movements were primarily\nto adjust something.Some of us worried for fear we wouldn't know when the\nadjusting was complete.We were told that all the movements we were taught\nto make were potent to \"move things,\" so we worried again for fear we\nmight move something in the wrong direction.She taught them to eschew pride,\nsending them to gather leaves in the streets, covering their garments\nwith patches, discouraging the use of razors on incipient beards; but\nfortunately a boy\u2019s companions take such nonsense out of him.She even\nleft a case of chills and fever to the misdirected mercies of a woman\ndoctor, a hom\u0153opathist.I myself was the victim, and for twenty-five\nyears I have abhorred women hom\u0153opathic physicians.But such trivial faults are not to be compared with the depths of a\nmother\u2019s love.To all that is intrinsically noble and beautiful she was\nkeenly sensitive.How good it was to see her exult in the glories of a\nMaryland sunset\u2014viewed from the housetop with her boys about her.And\nhow strange that this timid woman could allow them to risk their\nprecious necks on the roof of a three-story house!Perhaps her passion for the beautiful was most strikingly displayed in\nthe cultivation of her garden.To each son she dedicated a rose-bush.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.There was one for her husband and another for his mother.In a shady\npart of the yard grew lilies of the valley; and gladiolas, Easter lilies\nand other varieties of lilies were scattered here and there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.In the\nearly spring there were crocuses and hyacinths and daffodils.Vines\ntrailed along the fences and climbed the sides of the house.She was\nespecially fond of her English ivy.Honeysuckles flourished, hollyhocks\nran riot even in the front yard, morning-glories blossomed west of the\nhouse, by the front porch grew a sweet-briar rose with its fragrant\nleaves, and by the bay windows bloomed blue and white wisterias.A\nmagnolia bush stood near the parlor window, a forsythia by the front\nfence, and by the side alley a beautiful flowering bush with a dome of\nwhite blossoms.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.The flower beds were literally crowded, so that humming\nbirds, in their gorgeous plumage, were frequent visitors.Hall had loved the wild flowers of her native woods and fields; and\nin the woods back of Georgetown she sought out her old friends and\nbrought them home to take root in her yard, coaxing their growth with\nrich wood\u2019s earth, found in the decayed stump of some old tree.Thus the following poem, like all her poems, was but the expression of\nherself:\n\n                              ASPIRATION.The violet dreams forever of the sky,\n            Until at last she wakens wondrous fair,\n          With heaven\u2019s own azure in her dewy eye,\n            And heaven\u2019s own fragrance in her earthly air.The lily folds close in her heart the beams\n            That the pure stars reach to her deeps below,\n          Till o\u2019er the waves her answering brightness gleams\u2014\n            A star hath flowered within her breast of snow.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.The rose that watches at the gates of morn,\n            While pours through heaven the splendor of the sun,\n          Needs none to tell us whence her strength is born,\n            Nor where her crown of glory she hath won.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.And every flower that blooms on hill or plain\n            In the dull soil hath most divinely wrought\n          To haunting perfume or to heavenly stain\n            The sweetness born of her aspiring thought.With what expectancy we wait the hour\n          When all the hopes to which thou dost aspire\n            Shall in the holiness of beauty flower.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                           AN AMERICAN WOMAN.The desire of knowledge is a powerful instinct of the soul, as\n    inherent in woman as in man.... It was designed to be gratified, all\n    the avenues of her soul are open for its gratification.Her every\n    sense is as perfect as man\u2019s: her hand is as delicate in its touch,\n    her ear as acute in hearing, her eye the same in its wonderful\n    mechanism, her brain sends out the same two-fold telegraphic\n    network.She is endowed with the same consciousness, the same power\n    of perception.From her\n    very organization she is manifestly formed for the pursuit of the\n    same knowledge, for the attainment of the same virtue, for the\n    unfolding of the same truth.Whatever aids man in the pursuit of any\n    one of these objects must aid her also.Let woman then reject the\n    philosophy of a narrow prejudice or of false custom, and trust\n    implicitly to God\u2019s glorious handwriting on every folded tissue of\n    her body, on every tablet of her soul.Let her seek for the highest\n    culture of brain and heart.Let her apply her talent to the highest\n    use.In so doing will the harmony of her being be perfect.Brain and\n    heart according well will make one music.All the bright\n    intellections of the mind, all the beautiful affections of the heart\n    will together form one perfect crystal around the pole of Truth.From these words of hers it appears that Angeline Hall believed in a\nwell-rounded life for women as well as for men; and to the best of her\nability she lived up to her creed.Physically deficient herself, she\nheralded the advent of the American woman\u2014the peer of Spartan mother,\nRoman matron or modern European dame.Her ideal could hardly be called\n\u201cthe new woman,\u201d for she fulfilled the duties of wife and mother with\nthe utmost devotion.Among college women she was a pioneer; and perhaps\nthe best type of college woman corresponds to her ideal.[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF 1878]\n\n\nIn person she was not remarkable\u2014height about five feet three inches,\nweight with clothing about one hundred and twenty-three pounds.In\nmiddle life she was considerably bent over, more from years of toil than\nfrom physical weakness.Nervous strength was lacking; and early in life\nshe lost her teeth.But her frame was well developed, her waist being as\nlarge as a Greek goddess\u2019s, for she scorned the use of corsets.Her\nsmooth skin was of fine stout texture.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Her well-shaped head was adorned\nby thin curls of wonderfully fine, dark hair, which even at the time of\ndeath showed hardly a trace of white.Straight mouth, high forehead,\nstrong brow, large straight nose, and beautiful brown eyes indicated a\nwoman of great spiritual force.She cared little for adornment, believing that the person is attractive\nif the soul is good.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.Timid in the face of physical danger, she was\nendowed with great moral courage and invincible resolution.She used to\nspeak of \u201cgoing along and doing something,\u201d and of \u201cdoing a little every\nday.\u201d Friends and relatives found in her a wise counsellor and fearless\nleader.She was gifted with intellect of a high order\u2014an unquenchable\nthirst for knowledge, a good memory, excellent mathematical ability, and\nthe capacity for mental labor.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.But her sense of duty controlled, and she\ndevoted her talents to the service of others.Unlike Lady Macbeth in other respects, she was suited to bear\nmen-children.And, thanks to her true womanhood, she nursed them at the\nbreast.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.There were no bottle babies in the Hall family.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football.Tradition has it\nthat she endured the pains of childbirth with unusual fortitude, hardly\nneeding a physician.But this seeming strength was due in part to an\nunwise modesty.With hardly enough strength for the duties of each day, she did work\nenough for two women through sheer force of will.It is not surprising\nthen that she died, in the sixty-second year of her age, from a stroke\nof apoplexy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.She was by no means apoplectic in appearance, being rather\na pale person; but the blood-vessels of the brain were worn out and\ncould no longer withstand the pressure.In the fall of 1881, after the\ndeath of her sister Mary and of Nellie Woodward, daughter of her sister\nRuth, she was the victim of a serious sickness, which continued for six\nmonths or more.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Friends thought she would die; but her sister Ruth came\nand took care of her, and saved her for ten more years of usefulness.She lived to see her youngest son through college, attended his Class\nDay, and died a few days after his graduation.The motive power of her life was religious faith\u2014a faith that outgrew\nall forms of superstition.Brought up to accept the narrow theology of\nher mother\u2019s church, she became a Unitarian.The eldest son was sent\nregularly to the Unitarian Sunday School in Washington; but a quarrel\narising in the church, she quietly withdrew, and thereafter assumed the\nwhole responsibility of training her sons in Christian morals.Subsequently she took a keen interest in the Concord School of\nPhilosophy; and, adopting her husband\u2019s view, she looked to science for\nthe regeneration of mankind.In this she was not altogether wise, for\nher own experience had proven that the advancement of knowledge depends\nupon a divine enthusiasm, which must be fed by a religion of some sort.Fortunately, she was possessed of a poetic soul, and she never lost\nreligious feeling.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.The following poem illustrates very well the faith of her later life:\n\n                              TO SCIENCE.I.\n\n         Friend of our race, O Science, strong and wise!Though thou wast scorned and wronged and sorely tried,\n         Bound and imprisoned, racked and crucified,\n         Thou dost in life invulnerable rise\n         The glorious leader \u2019gainst our enemies.Thou art Truth\u2019s champion for the domain wide\n         Ye twain shall conquer fighting side by side.Thus thou art strong, and able thou to cope\n         With all thy enemies that yet remain.They fly already from the open plain,\n         And climb, hard-pressed, far up the rugged <DW72>.We hear thy bugle sound o\u2019er land and sea\n         And know that victory abides with thee.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.Because thou\u2019st conquered all _one_ little world\n           Thou never like the ancient king dost weep,\n           But like the brave Ulysses, on the deep\n           Dost launch thy bark, and, all its sails unfurled,\n           Dost search for new worlds which may lie impearled\n           By happy islands where the billows sleep;\n           Or into sunless seas dost fearless sweep,\n           Braving the tempest which is round thee hurled;\n           Or, bolder still, mounting where far stars shine,\n           From conquest unto conquest thou dost rise\n           And hold\u2019st dominion over realms divine,\n           Where, clear defined unto thy piercing eyes,\n           And fairer than Faith\u2019s yearnful heart did ween\n           Stretches the vastness of the great Unseen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.E\u2019en where thy sight doth fail thou givest not o\u2019er,\n          But still \u201cbeyond the red\u201d thy spectraphone\n          The ray invisible transforms to tone,\n          Thus winning from the silence more and more;\n          Wherein thou buildest new worlds from shore to shore\n          With hills perpetual and with mountains lone;\n          To music moving pond\u2019rous stone on stone\n          As unto Orpheus\u2019 lyre they moved of yore.Beyond the farthest sweep of farthest sun,\n          Beyond the music of the sounding spheres\n          Which chant the measures of the months and years,\n          Toward realms that e\u2019en to daring Thought are new\n          Still let thy flying feet unwearied run.let her not deem thee foe,\n           Though thou dost drive her from the Paradise\n           To which she clings with backward turning eyes,\n           Thou art her angel still, and biddest her go\n           To wider lands where the great rivers flow,\n           And broad and green many a valley lies,\n           Where high and grand th\u2019 eternal mountains rise,\n           And oceans fathomless surge to and fro.Thus thou dost teach her that God\u2019s true and real,\n           Fairer and grander than her dreams _must_ be;\n           Till she shall leave the realm of the Ideal\n           To follow Truth throughout the world with thee,\n           Through earth and sea and up beyond the sun\n           Until the mystery of God is won.Whatever the literary defects, these are noble sonnets.But I had rather\ntake my chances in a good Unitarian church than try to nourish the soul\nwith such Platonic love of God.She disliked the Unitarian habit of\nclinging to church traditions and ancient forms of worship; but better\nthese than the materialism of a scientific age.She was absolutely loyal to truth, not\nguilty of that shuffling attitude of modern theologians who have\noutgrown the superstition of Old Testament only to cling more\ntenaciously to the superstition of the New.In the Concord School of\nPhilosophy, and later in her studies as a member of the Ladies\u2019\nHistorical Society of Washington, she was searching for the new faith\nthat should fulfil the old.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.It might be of interest here to introduce\nselections from some of her Historical Society essays, into the\ncomposition of which she entered with great earnestness.Written toward\nthe close of life, they still retain the freshness and unspoiled\nenthusiasm of youth.One specimen must suffice:\n\n    In thinking of Galileo, and the office of the telescope, which is to\n    give us increase of light, and of the increasing power of the larger\n    and larger lenses, which widens our horizon to infinity, this\n    constantly recurring thought comes to me: how shall we grow into the\n    immensity that is opening before us?The principle of light pervades\n    all space\u2014it travels from star to star and makes known to us all\n    objects on earth and in heaven.The great ether throbs and thrills\n    with its burden to the remotest star as with a joy.But there is\n    also an all-pervading force, so subtle that we know not yet how it\n    passes through the illimitable space.But before it all worlds fall\n    into divine order and harmony.It imparts the\n    power of one to all, and gathers from all for the one.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.What in the\n    soul answers to these two principles is, first, also light or\n    knowledge, by which all things are unveiled; the other which answers\n    to gravitation, and before which all shall come into proper\n    relations, and into the heavenly harmony, and by which we shall fill\n    the heavens with ourselves, and ourselves with heaven, is love.But after all, Angeline Hall gave\nherself to duty and not to philosophy\u2014to the plain, monotonous work of\nhome and neighborhood.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she\nsupplied with her own hands the various family wants\u2014cooked with great\nskill, canned abundance of fruit for winter, and supplied the table from\nday to day with plain, wholesome food.Would that she might have taught\nBostonians to bake beans!If they would try her method, they would\ndiscover that a mutton bone is an excellent substitute for pork.Pork\nand lard she banished from her kitchen.Beef suet is, indeed, much\ncleaner.The chief article of diet was meat, for Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Hall was no\nvegetarian, and the Georgetown markets supplied the best of Virginia\nbeef and mutton.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she provided the\nfamily with warm clothing, and kept it in repair.A large part of her\nlife was literally spent in mending clothes.She never relaxed the rigid\neconomy of Cambridge days.She commonly needed but one servant, for she\nworked with her own hands and taught her sons to help her.The house was\nalways substantially clean from roof to cellar.Nowhere on the whole premises was a bad smell tolerated.While family wants were scrupulously attended to, she stretched forth a\nhand to the poor.The Civil War filled Washington with <DW64>s, and for\nseveral winters Mrs.In\n1872 she was \u201cDirectress\u201d of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth wards; and\nfor a long time she was a member of a benevolent society in Georgetown,\nhaving charge of a section of the city near her residence.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.For the last\nfourteen years of her life, she visited the Home for Destitute <DW52>\nWomen and Children in north Washington.Her poor <DW52> neighbors\nregarded her with much esteem.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.She listened to their stories of\ndistress, comforted them, advised them.The aged she admitted to her\nwarm kitchen; and they went away, victuals in their baskets or coins in\ntheir hands, with the sense of having a friend in Mrs.Uncle\nLouis, said to be one hundred and fourteen years old, rewarded her with\na grape-vine, which was planted by the dining room window.And \u201cthe\nUncle Louis grape\u201d was the best in the garden.At the close of the Civil War she even undertook to redeem two fallen\nIrish women by taking them into her house to work.But their appetite\nfor whiskey was too strong, and they would steal butter, barter it for\nliquor, and come home drunk.On one occasion one of these women took\nlittle Asaph along to visit the saloon; and there his mother found him,\nwith the servant standing by joking with rough men, her dress in shreds.Hall had no time or strength for such charitable enterprises, and\nsoon abandoned them.She was saved from most of the follies of\nphilanthropy by the good sense of her husband, whom she rewarded with\nthe devotion of a faithful wife.His studies and researches, almost from\nthe first, were much too deep for her entire comprehension, but she was\nalways enthusiastic about his work.In the introduction to his\n\u201c_Observations and Orbits of the Satellites of Mars_,\u201d Professor Hall\nchivalrously says:\n\n    In the spring of 1877, the approaching favorable opposition of the\n    planet Mars attracted my attention, and the idea occurred to me of\n    making a careful search with our large Clark refractor for a\n    satellite of this planet.An examination of the literature of the\n    planet showed, however, such a mass of observations of various\n    kinds, made by the most experienced and skillful astronomers that\n    the chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so\n    that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the\n    encouragement of my wife.Each night she sent her\nhusband to the observatory supplied with a nourishing lunch, and each\nnight she awaited developments with eager interest.I can well remember\nthe excitement at home.There was a great secret in the house, and all\nthe members of the family were drawn more closely together by mutual\nconfidence.The moral and intellectual training of her sons has already been\nreferred to.Summer vacations were often spent with her sisters in\nRodman, N.Y.Her mother, who reached the age of eighty years, died in\nthe summer of 1878, when Mrs.Hall became the head of the Stickney\nfamily.Her sisters Mary and Elmina were childless.Ruth had six\nchildren, in whose welfare their Aunt Angeline took a lively interest.The three girls each spent a winter with her in Washington, and when, in\nthe summer of 1881, Nellie was seized with a fatal illness, Aunt\nAngeline was present to care for her.Now and then Charlotte Ingalls,\nwho had prospered in Wisconsin, would come on from the West, and the\nStickney sisters would all be together.The last reunion occurred in the\nsummer of 1891, a year previous to Angeline\u2019s death.It was a goodly\nsight to see the sisters in one wagon, near the old home place; and\nwhen, at Elmina\u2019s house, Angeline was bustling about attending to the\nneeds of the united family, it was good to hear Charlotte exclaim, \u201cTake\ncare, old lady!\u201d She was thirteen years older than Angeline, and seemed\nalmost to belong to an earlier generation.She remembered her father\nwell, and had no doubt acquired from him some of the ancient New\nHampshire customs lost to her younger sisters.Certainly her\nexclamations of \u201cFiddlesticks,\u201d and \u201cWitch-cats,\u201d were quaint and\npicturesque.But it was Angeline who was really best versed in the family history.She had made a study of it, in all its branches, and could trace her\ndescent from at least eleven worthy Englishmen, most of whom arrived in\nNew England before 1650.She made excursions to various points in New\nEngland in search of relatives.At Belchertown, Mass., in 1884, she\nfound her grandfather Cook\u2019s first cousin, Mr.He was then\none hundred years old, and remembered how in boyhood he used to go\nskating with Elisha Cook.How brief the history of America in the presence of such a man!I\nremember seeing an old New Englander, as late as 1900, who as a boy of\neleven years had seen General Lafayette.It was a treat to hear him\ndescribe the courteous Frenchman, slight of stature, bent with age, but\nactive and polite enough to alight from the stage-coach to shake hands\nwith the people assembled to welcome him in the little village of\nCharlton, Mass.At the close of life she longed to\nvisit Europe, but death intervened, and her days were spent in her\nnative country.She passed two summers in the mountains of Virginia.In\n1878, with her little son Percival, she accompanied her husband to\nColorado, to observe the total eclipse of the sun.Three years before\nthey had taken the whole family to visit her sister Charlotte\u2019s people\nin Wisconsin.It was through her family loyalty that she acquired the Adirondack\nhabit.In the summer of 1882, after the severe sickness of the preceding\nwinter, she was staying with a cousin\u2019s son, a country doctor, in\nWashington County, N.Y.He proposed an outing in the invigorating air of\nthe Adirondacks.And so, with her three youngest sons and the doctor\u2019s\nfamily, she drove to Indian Lake, and camped there about a week.Her\nimprovement was so marked that the next summer, accompanied by three\nsons and her sister Ruth, she drove into the wilderness from the West,\ncamping a few days in a log cabin by the side of Piseco Lake.In 1885,\nsetting out from Rodman again, she drove four hundred miles, passing\nnorth of the mountains to Paul Smith\u2019s, and thence to Saranac Lake\nvillage, John Brown\u2019s farm, Keene Valley, and Lake George, and returning\nby way of the Mohawk Valley.In 1888 she camped with the three youngest\nsons on Lower Saranac, and in 1890 she spent July and August at the\nsummer school of Thomas Davidson, on the side of Mt.One day\nI escorted her and her friend Miss Sarah Waitt to the top of the\nmountain, four or five miles distant, and we spent the night on the\nsummit before a blazing camp-fire.Two years later she was planning\nanother Adirondack trip when death overtook her\u2014at the house of her\nfriend Mrs.Berrien, at North Andover, Mass., July 3, 1892.Her poem \u201cHeracles,\u201d written towards the close of her career, fittingly\ndescribes her own herculean labors:\n\n

Yesterday we buried Nellie over in the cemetery on\n    Grandfather\u2019s old farm in Rodman.You can not think how beautiful\n    and grand she looked.She had improved very much since she was at\n    our house, and I see she had many friends.I think she was a\n    superior girl, but too sensitive and ambitious to live in this world\n    so cramped and hedged about.She went down to help Mary, and Mr.Wright\u2019s people came for her to go up and help them as Mrs.Wright\n    was sick, so Nellie went up there and washed and worked very hard\n    and came back to Mary\u2019s completely exhausted, and I think she had a\n    congestive chill to begin with and another when she died.The little boys and I are at Elminas.I came over to rest a little,\n    am about used up.One of the neighbors has just come over saying\n    that Mary died last night at nine o\u2019clock, and will be buried\n    to-morrow.So to-morrow morning I suppose I shall go back over to\n    Constant\u2019s, do not know how long I shall stay there.I wish to know how you are getting on at home.With Much Love\n\n                C.

I am sorry the\n    Boston girl is getting to be so helpless.I think all who have to\n    keep some one to take care of them had better leave for Europe on\n    the first steamer.I think co-education would be a great help to both boys and girls.I\n    have never liked schools for girls alone since Harriette Lewis and\n    Antoinette McLain went to Pittsfield to the Young Ladies Institute.Stanton\u2019s advice to her sons, \u201cWhen\n    you marry do choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth.\u201d Now I\n    think a woman needs two kinds of good back-bone.As for Astronomical work, and all kinds of scientific work, there\n    may not be the pressing need there was for it a few centuries ago;\n    but I think our modern theory of progress is nearly right as\n    described by Taine, \u201cas that which founds all our aspirations on the\n    boundless advance of the sciences, on the increase of comforts which\n    their applied discoveries constantly bring to the human condition,\n    and on the increase of good sense which their discoveries,\n    popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.\u201d Of course Ethical\n    teaching must keep pace.It is well to keep the teaching of the\n    Prometheus Bound in mind, that merely material civilization is not\n    enough; and must not stand alone.But the knowledge that we get from\n    all science, that effects follow causes always, will teach perhaps\n    just as effectively as other preaching.This makes me think of the pleasant time Sam and I had when he was\n    home last, reading George Eliot\u2019s Romola.This work is really a\n    great drama, and I am much impressed with the power of it.I would say _Philosophy_ AND Science now and forever one and\n    inseparable....\n\n            With much love\n\n                C. A. S.

it was what she was that inclined footsteps to her\n    door.Those who once felt that subtle, penetrating sweetness felt\n    they must return to bask in it again and again.So she never lost\n    friends by a loss more pathetic than death.There were no\n    dislocations in her life.The good she did seemed to enter the pores of the spirit, and to\n    uplift in unknown ways the poor degraded ideal of our lives.The\n    secret of her help was not exuberance, but stillness and rest.Ever\n    more and more the beautiful secret eluded analysis.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.It shone out of\n    her eyes.It lingered in the lovely smile that irradiated her face,\n    and made every touch and tone a benediction.Even the dullest\n    perception must have seen that her life was spiritual, based on\n    unselfishness and charity.Beside her thoughtfulness and tender care\n    all other kinds of self-abnegation seemed poor.She lived in the\n    higher range of being.The purity of her face and the clearness of\n    her eyes was a rebuke to all low motives.But no word of criticism\n    fell from her lips.She was ready to take into her all-embracing\n    tenderness those whom others disliked and shunned.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Her gentle nature\n    found a thousand excuses for their faults.Life had been hard with\n    them; and, for this reason, she must be lenient.The good in each\n    soul was always present to her perceptions.She reverenced it even\n    in its evil admixture as a manifestation of the divine.She shunned the smallest witticism at another\u2019s expense, lest she\n    should pain or soil that pure inner mirror of conscience by an\n    exaggeration.To the poor\n    and despised she never condescended, but poured out her love and\n    charity as the woman of Scripture broke the box of precious ointment\n    to anoint the Master\u2019s feet.All human beings received their due\n    meed of appreciation at her hands.She disregarded the conventional\n    limits a false social order has set up, shunning this one and\n    honoring that one, because of externals.She was not afraid of\n    losing her place in society by knowing the wrong people.She went\n    her way with a strange unworldliness through all the prickly hedges,\n    daring to be true to her own nature.She drew no arbitrary lines\n    between human beings.The rich\n    were not welcome for their riches, nor the poor for their poverty;\n    but all were welcome for their humanity.Her door was as the door of a shrine because the fair amenities were\n    always found within.Hospitality to her was as sacred as the hearth\n    altar to the ancients.If she had not money to give the mendicant,\n    she gave that something infinitely better,\u2014the touch of human\n    kinship.Many came for the dole she had to bestow, the secret\n    charity that was not taken from her superfluity, but from her need.Her lowliness of heart was like that of a little child.How could a\n    stranger suspect that she was a deep and profound student?Her\n    researches had led her to the largest, most liberal faith in God and\n    the soul and the spirit of Christ incarnate in humanity.The study\n    of nature, to which she was devoted, showed her no irreconcilable\n    break between science and religion.She could follow the boldest\n    flights of the speculative spirit or face the last analysis of the\n    physicist, while she clung to God and the witness of her own being.She aimed at an all-round culture, that one part of her nature might\n    not be dwarfed by over-balance and disproportion.But it was the high thinking that went on with the daily doing of\n    common duties that made her life so exceptional.A scholar in the\n    higher realms of knowledge, a thinker, a seeker after truth, but,\n    above all, the mother, the wife, the bread-giver to the household.It was a great privilege to know this woman who aped not others\u2019\n    fashions, who had better and higher laws to govern her life, who\n    admitted no low motive in her daily walk, who made about her, as by\n    a magician\u2019s wand, a sacred circle, free from all gossip, envy,\n    strife, and pettiness, who kept all bonds intact by constancy and\n    undimmed affection, and has left a memory so sacred few can find\n    words to express what she was to her friends.*       *       *       *       *\n\n    But love and self-forgetfulness and tender service wear out the\n    silver cord.It was fretted away silently, without complaint, the\n    face growing ever more seraphic, at moments almost transparent with\n    the shining of an inner light.One trembled to look on that\n    spiritual beauty.Surely, the light of a near heaven was there.Silently, without complaint or murmur, she was preparing for the\n    great change.Far-away thoughts lay mirrored in her clear, shining\n    eyes.She had seen upon the mount the pattern of another life.Still\n    no outward change in duty-doing, in tender care for others.Then one\n    day she lay down and fell asleep like a little child on its mother\u2019s\n    breast, with the inscrutable smile on her lips.She who had been\n    \u201cmothering\u201d everybody all her life long was at last gathered gently\n    and painlessly into the Everlasting Arms.An amber Adirondack river flows\n               Down through the hills to blue Ontario;\n               Along its banks the staunch rock-maple grows,\n               And fields of wheat beneath the drifted snow.The summer sun, as if to quench his flame,\n               Dips in the lake, and sinking disappears.Such was the land from which my mother came\n               To college, questioning the future years;\n               And through the Northern winter\u2019s bitter gloom,\n               Gilding the pane, her lamp of knowledge burned.The bride of Science she; and he the groom\n               She wed; and they together loved and learned.And like Orion, hunting down the stars,\n               He found and gave to her the moons of Mars.------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n    \u25cf Transcriber\u2019s Notes:\n       \u25cb Missing or obscured punctuation was silently corrected.\u25cb Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation were made consistent only\n         when a predominant form was found in this book.\u25cb Text that was in italics is enclosed by underscores\n         (_italics_).He placed them in an\nenvelope, sealed it and, enclosing it in a second envelope, passed it\nover to Macloud.\"I don't care to inform them as to my whereabouts,\" he remarked, \"so,\nif you don't mind, I'll trouble you to address this to some one in New\nYork or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail the enclosed envelope\nfor you.\"Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid aside the pen and looked\ninquiringly at Croyden.\"Which, being interpreted,\" he said, \"might mean that you don't intend\nto return to Northumberland.\"\"The interpretation does not go quite so far; it means, simply, that I\nhave not decided.\"\"It's a question of resolution, not of inclination,\" Croyden answered.\"I don't know whether I've sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient\nresolution to stay, if I do go.It may be easier not to go, at all--to\nlive here, and wander, elsewhere, when the spirit moves.\"\"I've been thinking over the proposition you\nrecently advanced of the folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich\ngirl,\" he said, \"and you're all wrong.It's a question of the\nrespective pair, not a theory that can be generalized over.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.I admit,\nthe man should not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to support\n_himself_, and the girl love him and he loves the girl, the fact that\nshe has gobs more money, won't send them on the rocks.It's up to the\npair, I repeat.\"\"Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine Cavendish and me?\"\"I wish I could be so sure,\" Croyden reflected.\"Sure of the girl, as\nwell as sure of myself.\"Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously.\"I fancy I could manage myself,\" he said.\"Try her!--she's worth the try.\"\"Get the miserable money out of your mind a moment, will you?--you're\nhipped on it!\"\"All right, old man, anything for peace!Tell me, did you see her, when\nyou were home?\"\"You--she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths of the time; I, the\nother eighth.\"\"I refuse to become facetious,\" Macloud responded.Then he threw his\ncigar into the grate and arose.\"It matters not what was said, nor who\nsaid it!If you will permit me the advice, you will take your chance\nwhile you have it.\"\"You have--more than a chance, if you act, now----\" He walked across to\nthe window.He would let that sink in.--\"How's the Symphony in Blue?\"\"As charming as ever--and prepared for your coming.\"\"As charming as ever, and prepared for your coming.\"\"I left that finality for you--being the person most interested.\"\"When did you arrange for me to go over?\"\"In other words, you worked your imagination--overtime!\"\"It's a pity you couldn't work it a bit over the Parmenter\njewels.\"I'm done with the Parmenter jewels!\"\"But they're not done with you, my friend.So long as you live, they'll\nbe present with you.You'll be hunting for them in your dreams.\"\"Meet me to-night in dream-land!\"\"Well, they're not\nlikely to disturb my slumbers--unless--there was a rather queer thing\nhappened, last night, Colin.\"\"Yes!--I got in to Hampton, in the evening; about nine o'clock, I was\nreturning to Clarendon when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall,\nwell-dressed stranger.Here is the substance of our talk.... What do\nyou make of it?\"\"It seems to me the fellow made it very plain,\" Macloud returned,\n\"except on one possible point.He evidently believes we found the\ntreasure.\"\"Then, he knows that you came direct from Annapolis to Hampton--I mean,\nyou didn't visit a bank nor other place where you could have deposited\nthe jewels.Ergo, the jewels are still in your possession, according to\nhis theory, and he is going to make a try for them while they are\nwithin reach.He hoped, by that\nmeans, to induce you to keep the jewels on the premises--not to make\nevidence against yourself, which could be traced by the United States,\nby depositing them in any bank.\"\"Why shouldn't I have taken them to a dealer in precious stones?\"\"Because that would make the best sort of evidence against you.You\nmust remember, he thinks you have the jewels, and that you will try to\nconceal it, pending a Government investigation.\"\"No--I make him only a clever rogue, which, by your own account, he\nis.\"\"And the more clever he is, the more he will have his wits' work for\nnaught.There's some compensation in everything--even in failure!\"\"It would be a bit annoying,\" observed Macloud, \"to be visited by\nburglars, who are obsessed with the idea that you have a fortune\nconcealed on the premises, and are bent on obtaining it.\"\"Annoying?--not a bit!\"\"I should rather enjoy the\nsport of putting them to flight.\"\"Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated.\"you've transferred your robber-barons from Northumberland to the\nEastern Shore.\"\"The robber-barons were still on the\njob in Northumberland.These are banditti, disguised as burglars, about\nto hold you up for ransom.\"\"I wish I had your fine imagination,\" scoffed Croyden.\"It's bully good to think you're coming back to us!\"\"Here, Moses,\" said Croyden, \"take this letter down to the post\noffice--I want it to catch the first mail.\"\"I fancy you haven't heard of the stranger since last evening?\"\"And of course you haven't told any one?\"\"I suppose you even told\nher the entire story--from the finding of the letter down to date.\"\"I did!--and showed her the letter besides.\"No reason in the world, my dear fellow--except that in twenty-four\nhours the dear public will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.\"\"We don't have to remain,\" said Croyden, with affected seriousness--\"there\nare trains out, you know, as well as in.\"\"I don't want to go away--I came here to visit you.\"\"But we can't take the Symphony in Blue!\"You don't think I came down here to see only\nyou, after having just spent nearly four weeks with you, in that fool\nquest on Greenberry Point?\"He turned, suddenly, and faced Croyden.\"Think she will retail it to the\ndear public?\"\"Because, if you do, you might mention it to her--there, she goes,\nnow!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the apple.said Macloud, whirling around toward the window.On the opposite side of\nthe street, Miss Carrington--in a tailored gown of blue broadcloth,\nclose fitting and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque to match--was\nswinging briskly back from town.\"The old man is done for, at last!\"\"Look at the poise of the\nhead, and ease of carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!--that's\nthe way to tell a woman.\"It's about the tea hour, she'll\nbrew you a cup.\"\"And I'll drink it--as much as she will give me.I despise the stuff,\nbut I'll drink it!\"\"She'll put rum in it, if you prefer!\"laughed Croyden; \"or make you a\nhigh ball, or you can have it", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "\"I'll be over, presently,\" Croyden replied.\"_I_ don't want any tea,\nyou know.\"\"Come along, as soon as you\nwish--but don't come _too soon_.\"XV\n\nAN OLD RUSE\n\n\nMacloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few belated roses, which,\nsomehow, had escaped the frost.She looked up at his approach, and smiled--the bewilderingly bewitching\nsmile which lighted her whole countenance and seemed to say so much.\"And, if I may, to you,\" he replied.After them, you belong to _me_,\" she laughed.\"I don't know--it was the order of speech, and the order of\nacquaintance,\" with a naive look.\"You did it very well for a--novice.\"\"You decline to accept it?--Very well, sir, very well!\"\"I can't accept, and be honest,\" he replied.Perchance,\nyou will accept a reward: a cup of tea--or a high ball!\"\"Perchance, I will--the high ball!\"She looked at him, with a sly smile.\"You know that I have just returned,\" she said.\"I saw you in the\nwindow at Clarendon.\"\"And you came over at once--prepared to be surprised that I was here.\"\"And found you waiting for me--just as I expected.\"Peccavi!_\" he said humbly.\"_Te absolvo!_\" she replied, solemnly.\"Now, let us make a fresh\nstart--by going for a walk.You can postpone the high ball until we\nreturn.\"\"I can postpone the high ball for ever,\" he averred.\"Meaning, you could walk forever, or you're not thirsty?\"\"Meaning, I could walk forever _with you_--on, and on, and on----\"\n\n\"Until you walked into the Bay--I understand.I'll take the will for\nthe deed--the water's rather chilly at this season of the year.\"Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair.\"Let us make a third start--drop the attempt to be clever and talk\nsense.I think I can do it, if I try.\"As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was going down the street.\"I've not forgot your admonition, so don't be uneasy,\" he observed to\nMacloud.\"I'm going to town now, I'll be back in about half an hour--is\nthat too soon?\"Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically, but made no comment.\"The regulation walk--to the Cemetery and back.\"\"It's the favorite walk, here,\" she explained--\"the most picturesque\nand the smoothest.\"\"To say nothing of accustoming the people to their future home,\"\nMacloud remarked.\"You're not used to the ways of small towns--the Cemetery is a resort,\na place to spend a while, a place to visit.\"\"Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with it?\"\"However, I can see how it would\ninduce morbidity, though there are those who are happiest only when\nthey're miserable.\"\"Such people ought to live in a morgue,\" agreed Macloud.\"However\nwe're safe enough--we can go to the Cemetery with impunity.\"\"There are some rather queer old headstones, out there,\" she said.\"Remorse and the inevitable pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be\nthe leading subjects.There is one in the Duval lot--the Duvals from\nwhom Mr.Croyden got Clarendon, you know--and I never have been able to\nunderstand just what it means.It is erected to the memory of one\nRobert Parmenter, and has cut in the slab the legend: 'He feared nor\nman, nor god, nor devil,' and below it, a man on his knees making\nsupplication to one standing over him.If he feared nor man, nor god,\nnor devil, why should he be imploring mercy from any one?\"\"No--but I presume a connection of the family, from having been buried\nwith them.\"\"You read his letter only last evening--his letter to Marmaduke\nDuval.\"\"His letter to Marmaduke Duval!\"\"I didn't read any----\"\n\n\"Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried the treasure on Greenberry\nPoint,\" he interrupted.Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her.\"I see!--I didn't look at the name signed to the letter.And the\ncutting on the tombstone----?\"\"Is a victim begging mercy from him,\" said Macloud.\"I like that\nMarmaduke Duval--there's something fine in a man, in those times,\nbringing the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying him beside\nthe place where he, himself, some day would rest.--That is\nfriendship!\"\"It was a sad day in Hampton\nwhen the Colonel died.\"\"He left a good deputy,\" Macloud replied.\"Croyden is well-born and\nwell-bred (the former does not always comprehend the latter, these\ndays), and of Southern blood on his mother's side.\"\"We are a bit clannish,\nstill.\"\"Mine doesn't go so far South, however, as Croyden's--only,\nto Virginia.\"I knew there was some reason for my liking you!\"\"Than your Southern ancestors?--isn't that enough?\"\"Not if there be a means to increase it.\"\"Southern blood is never satisfied with _some_ things--it always wants\nmore!\"\"Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners, confined to the male\nsex?\"\"In _some things_--yes, unquestionably yes!\"Croyden told you of his experience, last\nevening?\"\"What possible danger could there be--the treasure isn't at\nClarendon.\"\"But they think it is--and desperate men sometimes take desperate\nmeans, when they feel sure that money is hidden on the premises.\"\"In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger is known.\"\"How will that advantage, in the prevention of the crime?\"\"They don't need stay in the town--they can come in an automobile.\"\"They could also drive, or walk, or come by boat,\" he added.\"They are not so likely to try it if there are two in the house.Do you\nintend to remain at Clarendon some time?\"\"I engage to be nice for--two weeks!\"\"Done!--I'm booked for two weeks, at least.\"\"And when the two weeks have expired we shall consider whether to\nextend the period.\"She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.\"If you will,\" he said, bending down.\"This pace is getting rather\nbrisk--did you notice it, Mr.\"You're in a fast class, Miss Carrington.\"\"Now don't misunderstand me----\"\n\n\"You were speaking in the language of the race track, I presume.\"\"A Southern girl usually loves--horses,\" with a tantalizing smile.\"It is well for you this is a public street,\" he said.\"But then if it hadn't been, you would not have ventured to tempt me,\"\nhe added.\"I'm grateful for the temptation, at any rate.\"\"No, not likely--but his first that he has resisted.\"The fact that we are on a public street would\nnot restrain you.There was absolutely no one within sight--and you\nknew it.\"\"Any way, here is\nthe Cemetery, and we dare not go faster than a walk in it.Yonder, just\nwithin the gates, is the Duval burial place.Come, I'll show you\nParmenter's grave?\"They crossed to it--marked by a blue slate slab, which covered it\nentirely.The inscription, cut in script, was faint in places and\nblurred by moss, in others.Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched out the latter.\"He died two days after the letter was written: May 12, 1738,\" said he.Duval did not know it, I reckon.\"\"See, here is the picture--it stands out very plainly,\" said Miss\nCarrington, indicating with the point of her shoe.\"I'm not given to moralizing, particularly over a grave,\" observed\nMacloud, \"but it's queer to think that the old pirate, who had so much\nblood and death on his hands, who buried the treasure, and who wrote\nthe letter, lies at our feet; and we--or rather Croyden is the heir of\nthat treasure, and that we searched and dug all over Greenberry Point,\ncommitted violence, were threatened with violence, did things\nsurreptitiously, are threatened, anew, with blackmail and\nviolence----\"\n\n\"Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways,\" she quoted.\"It does seem one cannot get away from its pollution.It was gathered\nin crime and crime clings to it, still.However, I fancy Croyden would\nwillingly chance the danger, if he could unearth the casket.\"\"Absolutely none--there's half a million over on Greenberry Point, or\nin the water close by, and none will ever see it--except by accident.\"\"My own idea--and Croyden's (as he has,\ndoubtless, explained to you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried\nthe jewels, is now under water, possibly close to the shore.We dragged\nevery inch of the bottom, which has been washed away to a depth more\nthan sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.A great\nstorm, such as they say sometimes breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash\nit on the beach--that, I think, is the only way it will ever be\nfound.... It makes everything seem very real to have stood by\nParmenter's grave!\"he said, thoughtful, as they turned back toward\ntown.On nearing the Carrington house, they saw Croyden approaching.\"I've been communing with Parmenter,\" said Macloud.\"I didn't know there was a spiritualistic medium in Hampton!\"Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?\"\"He wasn't especially communicative--he was in his grave.\"\"That isn't surprising--he's been dead something over one hundred and\nseventy years.\"He's buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery, here.\"<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.one more circumstance to prove the\nletter speaks the truth.We find his\nwill, probated with Marmaduke Duval as executor, we even discover a\nnotice of his death in the _Gazette_, and now, finally, you find his\nbody--or the place of its interment!what is really\nworth while, we can't find.\"\"Come into the house--I'll give you something to soothe your feelings\ntemporarily,\" said Miss Carrington.They encountered Miss Erskine just coming from the library on her way\nto the door.\"My dear Davila, so glad to see you!\"Croyden,\nwe thought you had deserted us, and just when we're trying to make you\nfeel at home.\"I'm delighted to be back,\" said Croyden.\"The Carringtons seemed\ngenuinely glad to see me--and, now, if I may include you, I'm quite\ncontent to return,\" and he shook her hand, as though he meant it.\"Of course you may believe it,\" with an inane giggle.\"I'm going to\nbring my art class over to Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some\nday, soon.You'll be at home to them, won't you, dear Mr.I shall take pleasure in being at home,\" Croyden replied,\nsoberly.Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain, was called over and\npresented, that being, Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of\ngetting rid of her.The evident intention to remain until he was\npresented, being made entirely obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she\nhad bubbled a bit more, departed.\"What is her name, I didn't catch it?--and\" (observing smiles on\nCroyden and Miss Carrington's faces) \"what is she?\"\"I think father can explain, in more appropriate language!\"\"She's the most intolerable nuisance and greatest fool in Hampton!\"\"A red flag to a bull isn't in it with Miss Erskine and father,\" Miss\nCarrington observed.\"But I hide it pretty well--while she's here,\" he protested.\"If she's not here too long--and you can get away, in time.\"When the two men left the Carrington place, darkness had fallen.As\nthey approached Clarendon, the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted\nhouse sprang out to greet them.It was Croyden's one extravagance--to\nhave plenty of illumination.He had always been accustomed to it, and\nthe gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright only in library\nor living room--with, maybe, a timid taper in the hall--set his nerves\non edge.And Moses, with considerable wonder\nat, to his mind, the waste of gas, and much grumbling to himself and\nJosephine, obeyed.They had finished dinner and were smoking their cigars in the library,\nwhen Croyden, suddenly bethinking himself of a matter which he had\nforgotten, arose and pulled the bell.said old Mose a moment later from the doorway.\"Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?\"\"Mistah Snyder, seh--he wuz heah dis arfternoon, yo knows, seh!\"\"I didn't know it,\" said Croyden.\"Dat's mons'us 'culiar, seh--he said yo sont 'im.He com'd 'torrectly\narfter yo lef!Him an' a'nudder man, seh--I didn't know the nudder man,\nhows'ever.\"\"Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place, seh, an' see what\nrepairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.Dey wuz heah a'most two hours, I\ns'pose.\"\"Do you mean they were\nin this house for two hours?\"I didn't stays wid em, seh--I knows\nMistah Snyder well;

a\nlittle more trouble in disguising himself, but vastly more satisfactory\nin results.\"\"They are clever rogues,\" said Croyden--\"and the disguise must have\nbeen pretty accurate to deceive Moses.\"\"Disguise is their business,\" Macloud replied, laconically.\"If they're\nnot proficient in it, they go to prison--sure.\"\"And if they _are_ proficient, they go--sometimes.\"\"We'll make a tour of inspection--they couldn't find what they wanted,\nso we'll see what they took.\"Every drawer was turned upside down, every\ncloset awry, every place, where the jewels could be concealed, bore\nevidence of having been inspected--nothing, apparently, had been\nmissed.They had gone through the house completely, even into the\ngarret, where every board that was loose had evidently been taken up\nand replaced--some of them carelessly.Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could judge--possibly, because\nthere was no money in the house; probably, because they were looking\nfor jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value.\"Really, this thing grows interesting--if it were not so ridiculous,\"\nsaid Croyden.\"I'm willing to go to almost any trouble to convince them\nI haven't the treasure--just to be rid of them.\"Abduction, maybe,\" Macloud suggested.\"Some night a black cloth will\nbe thrown over your head, you'll be tossed into a cab--I mean, an\nautomobile--and borne off for ransom like Charlie Ross of fading\nmemory.\"\"Moral--don't venture out after sunset!\"\"And don't venture out at any time without a revolver handy and a good\npair of legs,\" added Macloud.\"I can work the legs better than I can the revolver.\"\"Or, to make sure, you might have a guard of honor and a gatling gun.\"\"You're appointed to the position--provide yourself with the gun!\"said Macloud, \"it would be well to take some\nprecaution.They seem obsessed with the idea that you have the jewels,\nhere--and they evidently intend to get a share, if it's possible.\"XVI\n\nTHE MARABOU MUFF\n\n\nThe next two weeks passed uneventfully.The thieves did not manifest\nthemselves, and the Government authorities did nothing to suggest that\nthey had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.Macloud had developed an increasing fondness for Miss Carrington's\nsociety, which she, on her part, seemed to accept with placid\nequanimity.They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed when the\nweather warranted--and the weather had recovered from its fit of the\nblues, and was lazy and warm and languid.In short, they did everything\nwhich is commonly supposed to denote a growing fondness for each\nother.Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia Development Company\nbonds, and was once more on \"comfortable street,\" as he expressed it.But he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.On the contrary,\nhe settled down to enjoy the life of the village, social and otherwise.He was nice to all the girls, but showed a marked preference for Miss\nCarrington; which, however, did not trouble his friend, in the least.Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with Croyden.He was\nconfident that the call of the old life, the memory of the girl that\nwas, and that was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from more\nthan firm friendship.He was not quite sure of himself, however--that\nhe wanted to marry.And he was entirely sure she had not decided\nwhether she wanted him--that was what gave him his lease of life; if\nshe decided _for_ him, he knew that he would decide for her--and\nquickly.Then, one day, came a letter--forwarded by the Club, where he had left\nhis address with instructions that it be divulged to no one.It was\ndated Northumberland, and read:\n\n  \"My dear Colin--\n\n  \"It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I'm not going to\n  try it.I want to know whether Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to\n  Northumberland?If he is not\n  coming and there is no one else--won't you tell me where you are?(I don't ask you to reveal his address, you see.)I shall come\n  down--if only for an hour, between trains--and give him his\n  chance.It is radically improper, according to accepted\n  notions--but notions don't bother me, when they stand (as I am\n  sure they do, in this case), in the way of happiness.\"Sincerely,\n\n                                           \"Elaine Cavendish.\"At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:\n\n\"I ought to go out to Northumberland, this week, for a short time,\nwon't you go along?\"\"I'm not going back to Northumberland,\" he said.\"I'll promise to come back\nwith you in two days at the most.\"For me, it's easier to stay away from Northumberland, than to\ngo away from it, _again_.\"And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation, saying only:\n\n\"Well, I may not have to go.\"A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at Carringtons', he\nbroached a matter which had been on his mind for some time--working\naround to it gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.When his\nopportunity came--as it was bound to do--he took it without\nhesitation.\"Croyden had two reasons for leaving\nNorthumberland: one of them has been eliminated; the other is stronger\nthan ever.\"She looked at him, shrewdly.\"A woman who has plenty of money--more than she can ever\nspend, indeed.\"\"What was the\ntrouble--wouldn't she have him?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.\"Her money--she has so much!--So much, that, in comparison, he is a\nmere pauper:--twenty millions against two hundred thousand.\"\"If she be willing, I can't see why he is shy?\"\"He says it is all right for a poor girl to marry a rich man, but not\nfor a poor man to marry a rich girl.His idea is, that the husband\nshould be able to maintain his wife according to her condition.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.To\nmarry else, he says, is giving hostages to fortune, and is derogatory\nto that mutual respect which should exist between them.\"\"We all give hostages to fortune when we marry!\"she asked hastily--\"or can I do\nanything?\"\"You can ask Miss Cavendish to visit you for a\nfew days.\"\"Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine Cavendish?\"\"That's exactly who I do mean--do you know her?\"\"After a fashion--we went to Dobbs Ferry together.\"\"On the contrary, she'll think it more than kind--a positive favor.You\nsee, she knows I'm with Croyden, but she doesn't know where; so she\nwrote to me at my Club and they forwarded it.Croyden left\nNorthumberland without a word--and no one is aware of his residence but\nme.She asks that I tell her where _I_ am.Then she intends to come\ndown and give Croyden a last chance.I want to help her--and your\ninvitation will be right to the point--she'll jump at it.\"\"Come, we'll work out the letter\ntogether.\"\"Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss Cavendish's deputy?\"\"Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy,\" she answered.--\"Moreover, it\nwould be premature.\"The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish's maid brought her\nbreakfast, Miss Carrington's letter was on the tray among tradesmen's\ncirculars, invitations, and friendly correspondence.She did not recognize the handwriting, and the postmark was unfamiliar,\nwherefore, coupled with the fact that it was addressed in a\nparticularly stylish hand, she opened it first.It was very brief, very\nsuccinct, very informing, and very satisfactory.\"Ashburton,\n\n                             \"Hampton, Md.Macloud tells me you are contemplating coming down to the\n  Eastern Shore to look for a country-place.Let me advise\n  Hampton--there are some delightful old residences in this\n  vicinity which positively are crying for a purchaser.Geoffrey\n  Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident here, and is\n  thinking of making it his home permanently.If you can be\n  persuaded to come, you are to stay with me--the hotels are simply\n  impossible, and I shall be more than delighted to have you.We\n  can talk over old times at Dobbs, and have a nice little visit\n  together.Don't trouble to write--just wire the time of your\n  arrival--and come before the good weather departs.\"With lots of love,\n\n                                          \"Davila Carrington.\"Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly--and smiled.\"Colin is rather a diplomat--he\nmanaged it with exceeding adroitness--and the letter is admirably\nworded.I'd forgotten about\nDavila Carrington, and I reckon she had forgotten me, till he somehow\nfound it out and jogged her memory.She went to her desk and wrote this wire,\nin answer:\n\n  \"Miss Davila Carrington,\n\n       \"Hampton, Md.\"I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud.\"Now, I've done all that I can; the rest is in your hands,\" she said.\"I'll cooperate, but you are the general.\"\"Until Elaine comes--she will manage it then,\" Macloud answered.And on Friday morning, a little before noon, Miss Cavendish arrived.Miss Carrington, alone, met her at the station.\"You're just the same Davila I'd forgotten for years,\" said she,\nlaughingly, as they walked across the platform to the waiting carriage.\"And you're the same I had forgotten,\" Davila replied.\"And it's just as delightful to be able to remember,\" was the reply.Just after they left the business section, on the drive out, Miss\nCarrington saw Croyden and Macloud coming down the street.Evidently\nMacloud had not been able to detain him at home until she got her\ncharge safely into Ashburton.She glanced at Miss Cavendish--she had\nseen them, also, and, settling back into the corner of the phaeton, she\nhid her face with her Marabou muff.as both men raised their\nhats--and drove straight on.\"Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?\"\"I noticed a bag in the trap,\nhowever, so I reckon she's a guest.\"\"Your opportunity, for the\nsolitariness of two, will be limited.\"It depends on what she is--I'm not\nsacrificing myself on the altar of general unattractiveness.\"\"Rest easy, I'll fuss her to the limit.You shan't have her to\nplead for an excuse.\"I'm not worried about the guest,\" Macloud\nremarked.\"There was a certain style about as much of her as I could see which\npromised very well,\" Croyden remarked.\"I think this would be a good\nday to drop in for tea.\"\"And if you find her something over sixty, you'll gallantly shove her\noff on me, and preempt Miss Carrington.\"She's not over sixty--and you know it.You're by no means as blind as\nyou would have me believe.In fact, now that I think of it, there was\nsomething about her that seems familiar.\"\"You're an adept in many things,\" laughed Macloud, \"but, I reckon,\nyou're not up to recognizing a brown coat and a brown hat.I think I've\nseen the combination once or twice before on a woman.\"\"Well, what about tea-time--shall we go over?\"\"I haven't the slightest objection----\"\n\n\"Really!\"\"----to your going along with me--I'm expected!\"pretty soon it will be: 'Come over and\nsee us, won't you?'\"\"I trust so,\" said Macloud, placidly.--\"But, as you're never coming\nback to Northumberland, it's a bit impossible.\"\"I've a faint recollection of having heard that remark before.\"\"I dare say, it's popular there on smoky days.\"\"Which is the same as saying it's popular there any time.\"\"No, I don't mean that; Northumberland isn't half so bad as it's\npainted.We may make fun of it--but we like it, just the same.\"\"Yes, I suppose we do,\" said Macloud.\"Though we get mighty sick of\nseeing every scatterbrain who sets fire to the Great White Way branded\nby the newspapers as a Northumberland millionaire.We've got our share\nof fools, but we haven't a monopoly of them, by any means.\"\"We had a marvelously large crop, however, running loose at one time,\nrecently!\"\"True!--and there's the reason for it, as well as the fallacy.Because\nhalf a hundred light-weights were made millionaires over night, and,\ntop heavy, straightway went the devil's pace, doesn't imply that the\nentire town is mad.\"\"It's no worse than any other big town--and\nthe fellows with unsavory reputations aren't representative.The misfortune is, that the whole country saw the\nfireworks, and it hasn't forgot the lurid display.\"\"And isn't likely to very soon,\" Macloud responded, \"with the whole\nMunicipal Government rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one\nanother in their eagerness to plead _nolle contendere_ and escape the\npenitentiary, bankers in jail for bribery, or fighting extradition; and\ngraft!permeating every department of the civic life--and\npublished by the newspapers' broadcast, through the land, for all the\nworld to read, while the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly\nsuffer the robbers to remain.The trouble with the Northumberlander is,\nthat so long as he is not the immediate victim of a hold up, he is\nquiescent.Let him be touched direct--by burglary, by theft, by\nembezzlement--and the yell he lets out wakes the entire bailiwick.\"\"It's the same everywhere,\" said Croyden.\"No, it's not,--other communities have waked up--Northumberland hasn't.There is too much of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and the\ncouncilmen know it, and are out for the stuff, as brazen as the\nstreet-walker, and vastly more insistent.--I'm going in here, for some\ncigarettes--when I come out, we'll change the talk to something less\nirritating.I like Northumberland, but I despise about ninety-nine one\nhundredths of its inhabitants.\"When he returned, Croyden was gazing after an automobile which was\ndisappearing in a cloud of dust.\"The fellow driving, unless I am mightily\nfooled, is the same who stopped me on the street, in front of\nClarendon,\" he said.\"He isn't travelling around with\na petticoat--at least, if he's thinking of tackling you.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.\"It isn't likely, I admit--but suppose he is?\"The car was rapidly vanishing in the distance.\"He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will turn.\"\"I've got a very accurate memory for faces,\" said Croyden.If it was he, and he has some new scheme, it will be\ndeclared in due time.So long as they think you have the jewels, they will try\nfor them.There's Captain Carrington standing at his office door.\"Distinctly\nproper, sir, distinctly proper!Go and chat with him; I'll stop for\nyou, presently.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, the two women had continued on to Ashburton.Elaine asked, dropping her muff from before her\nface, when they were past the two men.\"It would make a difference in my--attitude toward him when we met!\"The\nfact that Croyden did not come out and stop them, that he let them go\non, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized her.\"You see, I am assuming that you know why I wanted to come to Hampton,\"\nElaine said, when, her greeting made to Mrs.Carrington, she had\ncarried Davila along to her room.\"And you made it very easy for me to come.\"\"I did as I thought you would want--and as I know you would do with me\nwere I in a similar position.\"\"I'm sadly afraid I should not have thought of you, were you----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you would!If you had been in a small town, and Mr.Croyden\nhad told you of my difficulty----\"\n\n\"As _Mr.Macloud_ told you of mine--I see, dear.\"\"Not exactly that,\" said Davila, blushing.Macloud has been very\nattentive and very nice and all that, you know, but you mustn't forget\nthere are not many girls here, and I'm convenient, and--I don't take\nhim seriously.\"\"I don't know--sometimes I think he does, and sometimes I think he\ndoesn't!\"\"He is an accomplished flirt and difficult to\ngauge.\"\"Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information: there isn't a\nmore indifferent man in Northumberland.He goes everywhere, is in great\ndemand, is enormously popular, yet, I've never known him to have even\nan affair.He is armor-plated--but he is a dear, a perfect dear,\nDavila!\"she said, with heightening color--and Elaine said no more,\nthen.Croyden alone, for the first time, or in\ncompany?\"\"I confess I don't know, but I think, however, it would be better to\nhave a few words with Colin, first--if it can be arranged.\"Macloud is to come in a moment before\nluncheon, if he can find an excuse that will not include Mr.\"Is an excuse difficult to find--or is any, even, needed?\"\"He doesn't usually come before four--that's the tea hour in Hampton.\"\"If you've got him into the tea habit, you can\ndo what you want with him--he will eat out of your hand.\"\"I never tried him with tea,\" said Davila.\"He chose a high ball the\nfirst time--so it's been a high ball ever since.\"Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila.\"But we shall be good friends, better\nfriends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.\"\"That is just the question, Elaine,\" was the quick answer; \"whether I\nshall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.I\nhaven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,\nI intend to keep tight hold on myself.\"\"Yes, I'm here, thanks to you,\" said Elaine--and Davila not being\npresent, she kissed him.\"No--but I wish the other--would, too!\"\"You're not wont to be so timid,\" she returned.\"I wish I had some of your bravery,\" he said.\"Isn't it impetuous womanliness.\"There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.\"\"But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see.\"And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have\ngreat hopes, Elaine, great hopes!\"\"How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.\"\"You could not at one time, you mean.\"\"You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.\"\"How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?\"\"By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The\nguest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He\ncould see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before\nyour face, and his imagination, did the rest.\"", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "It's simply the country town beginning to tell\non him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't\nmentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there\nwas something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to\nparticularize.\"I think not--we shall all be present.\"\"I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?\"He will know why I'm\nhere, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I\nshall know instantly.It's absurd, this\nnotion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I\nwanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose\nto a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than\nshe--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,\nindeed!\"\"Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it\nmyself.\"XVII\n\nA HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE\n\n\nMiss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her\nroom, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her\ngown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,\nand fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair\nwas arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite\ntaste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the\nbalustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard\nMacloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud\nsay:\n\n\"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be\na guest you were driving with this morning.\"Croyden,\" Miss Carrington\nreplied.\"Did you ever know a woman to be ready?\"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her,\" Macloud\nremarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)\"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her,\" said he--\"she\nwouldn't let me see her face.\"(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)\"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.\"\"She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.\"\"Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!\"\"If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going\nto talk to Miss Carrington.\"\"If it is, I know one who must\nbe too blase even to move,\" with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the\nhallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the\nroom.Croyden's from astonishment; the\nothers' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there\ngave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,\nand he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating\nsmile.\"You are surprised to see me, messieurs?\"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again.\"I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud,\" he said.\"Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express\nit.\"\"Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were\nfriends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.\"\"Well, you're likely not to forget it again.\"\"Did you know that I--that we were here?\"I knew that you and Colin were both here,\" Elaine replied,\nimperturbably.\"Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be\nmentioned by Miss Carrington?\"she asked--while Elaine and Macloud\nlaughed.\"You said you would take a _sour_ ball.\"A man who mixes a\nhigh ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the\nlatter, therefore----\"\n\n\"You mean that my coming has rattled you?\"\"Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.\"\"You could spare a few--and not miss them!\"\"Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!\"By the ladies' presence--God save them!\"\"Colin,\" said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to\nClarendon, \"you should have told me.\"\"Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.\"\"The muff hid her face from me, too.\"\"Do you think it was wise to let her come?\"Miss Carrington asked her, she\naccepted.\"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully.\"I'm telling you the truth,\" said Macloud.\"She tried to get your\naddress, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.\"\"And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it\nwouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual\nfriend, would come nosing around, and blow on me.\"I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll\nbe sorry enough when she goes, however.\"\"I must--it's the only proper thing to do.\"\"Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for\nher?\"\"Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and\nwife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other\nwords, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to\nundertake it?\"Her income, for three\nmonths, about equals my entire fortune.\"\"And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a\nyear?\"\"I think I could, if I loved the girl.\"\"And suffer in your self-respect forever after?\"If you\nplay _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.\"\"It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is\nsaying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in\nconsequence.\"\"Why the devil need you care what the world says!\"\"I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the\nman retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.\"\"It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold\nit, if you take the trouble to try.\"Croyden laughed, as they entered\nClarendon.\"Just what I should like to know----\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,\"\nMacloud interrupted--\"You're an unmitigated fool!\"\"Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.\"\"You're not likely to marry her, otherwise,\" retorted Macloud, as he\nwent up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden\nin the hall below.\"And if you don't take your chance, the chance she\nhas deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse\nthan----\" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent.\"How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?\"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and\ninto his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running\nin the Metropolis.\"Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,\n          Ev'ry thought and action----\"\n\nThe door slammed--the music ceased.\"I won't believe it,\" Croyden reflected, \"that Elaine would do anything\nso utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might\nhave had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old\npirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation.\"As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,\ncarefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to\nfollow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him\nto too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring\nloveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious\nfruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew\nharder the more he contemplated it....\n\n\"It's no use fighting against it, here!\"he exclaimed, going into\nMacloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair.\"I'm going to cut the\nwhole thing.\"Macloud inquired, pausing with\nhis waistcoat half on.\"What the devil do you think I'm talking about?\"\"Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.\"\"Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to\nleave town?\"\"He is coming to it, at last,\" he thought.What he said was:--\"You're\nnot going to be put to flight by a woman?\"\"I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.\"\"Most people would not call that _losing_,\" said Macloud.\"I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.\"\"It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.\"I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.\"\"You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm\nhere?\"\"I assume nothing,\" Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle.\"I said you\nhave a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have\noffered any suggestion--I admit that----\"\n\n\"Oh, bosh!\"\"Don't be so humble--you're rather\nproud of your interference.\"I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.\"\"You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.\"Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't\nmake any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to\nput it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in\ncontrol.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,\nand so on--and so on.\"\"You need a cock-tail, instead\nof a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at\nseven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to\na man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.\"\"Let future events determine--take it as it comes,\" Macloud urged.\"If I let future events\ndecide for me, the end's already fixed.\"The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell\nat Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the\nCaptain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took\nMacloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle\nimpatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door.\"Go up to Miss\nDavila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven.\"Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,\ninterrogatingly.\"Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh,\" said the girl.\"She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her,\" the\nCaptain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is\nMis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.\"\"They were here, two hours ago,\" said Croyden.\"Find out from the other servants whether they left any word.\"excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them.\"He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,\nthe Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the\nsame answer: \"They were not there, and hadn't been there that\nafternoon.\"\"We are at your service, Captain Carrington,\" said Macloud\ninstantly.--\"At your service for anything we can do.\"\"They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?\"he asked, as he\nled the way upstairs.--\"I can't account for it.\"The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,\nMacloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the\nhouse.\"They will surely turn up\nbefore we have finished.\"The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned.\"The keys of the stable are on my desk,\nwhich shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a\nloss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation\nand a good laugh at us for being anxious.\"But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they\ndid not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence\nafter residence, without result.\"I don't know what to make of it,\" he said, bewildered.\"I've called\nevery place I can think of, and I can't locate them.\"Let us see how the matter stands,\" said Macloud.\"We left them here\nabout half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has\nseen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a\ndrive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark\nand cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,\nthey didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is\nthe probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the\ncause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.\"\"But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long\nsince; the walks are not deserted,\" the Captain objected.\"Possibly, they went out of the town.\"\"A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted,\" was the decisive\nanswer.\"I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?\"\"Davila would never forgive me, if\nnothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is\nclosed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six\no'clock.\"\"Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout,\" said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two,\" the Captain\nsaid.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and\nSouth.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a\nmoment----\"\n\n\"What do you make of it?\"\"It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if\nanything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary,\" Croyden\nanswered.\"Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the\nserious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the\ncountry--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger\nfrom the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which\nwould prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or\ngetting some sort of word to the Captain.\"\"It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and\nexplanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really\nterrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just\ndisquieted.\"take these,\" he said, giving each a revolver.\"Let us hope there\nwon't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared.\"They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,\nthey parted.eleven o'clock at my house,\" said the Captain.\"If any one\nof us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance.\"It was a chilly November night, with\nfrost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink\ninto the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,\nwhere the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid\nbrilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the\ncountry.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for\nhalf an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a\nhalf each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He\nproceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the\nuncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the\nallotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He\ncrossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town\nwere gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a\nsmall white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of\nviolets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a\nmonogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the\ndarkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet\nfarther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his\nhands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the\nmonogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her\nfavorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid\naffair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back\ninto his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and\nMacloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the\ntable--\"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.\"\"The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's,\" said he.\"I'm going to call in our friends,\" he said.XVIII\n\nTHE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY\n\n\nWhen Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,\nafter their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while\nin the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades.\"What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?\"\"I should like it, immensely,\" Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out.\"We will go down to the centre of the town and back,\" said Davila.\"It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long\nas you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,\nhowever, even in daylight.\"It's the curse that hangs over the South\nsince the Civil War: the <DW64>.\"I understand,\" said Elaine, shuddering.\"I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are\nentirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in\nthe minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>\nis the worst thing on earth.\"\"I think I prefer only the lighted streets,\" Elaine remarked.\"And you will be perfectly safe there,\" Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main\nthoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle\nthat, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously\nenough, as \"The Diamond.\"Passing around this circle, they retraced\ntheir steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side\ncurtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though\nuncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington\nplace.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across\nthe pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back\nfrom the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, \"can you\ntell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?\"said the man, standing aside to let them pass.\"I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?\"\"Captain Carrington, is he at home?\"\"I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire.\"Davila thanked him with a smile,\nand she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,\nwhich had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around\nher head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,\ndespite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close\nto their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed\ninto the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver \"opened her up,\" and\nthey sped through the country at thirty miles an hour.\"Better give them some air,\" said the leader.\"It doesn't matter how\nmuch they yell here.\"He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight\naround her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds.\"You will please pardon the liberty we have taken,\" he said, as he\nfreed her, \"but there are----\"\n\nCrack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,\nspringing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her\nand forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still\naround her, and bound them tight to her side.\"I got an upper cut on the\njaw that made me see stars.\"\"I've been very easy with mine,\" his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her\narms.\"There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly\ninconvenienced.\"\"Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!\"\"At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car,\" said\nElaine.\"Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold\nus in this disgusting position.\"\"I reckon that is a trifle overstated!\"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far\nmore expressive than words.\"Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss\nCavendish.\"He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the\nshawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap\nto the floor.\"Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your\nfriend?\"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine.\"If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have\nthe seat----\"\n\n\"No!----\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the\nfloor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the\nseat.\"They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country\ncould scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it\nwas an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she\ncould recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some\ntopographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,\ncoupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his\npocket, he bound the eyes of both.\"It is only for a short while,\" he explained--\"matter of an hour or\nso, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust.\"Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:\n\n\"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need\nfear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring\nfreedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our\ncommand, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be\npermitted to communicate with your friends.\"\"But I should be better pleased if you\nwould tell us the reason for this abduction.\"\"That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.\"\"In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done\nwith you.\"\"Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.\"\"Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?\"\"Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?\"\"But you will threaten,\nif----\"\n\n\"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.\"\"Do you appreciate that the\nwhole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if\nthe least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?\"\"We take the risk, Miss Carrington,\" replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an\nhour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,\nand stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and\nsprang out.\"You may descend,\" he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the\nhand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,\nlow, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light\nburned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them.\"I\nsuppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively\nfamished.\"\"I'm too enraged to eat,\" said Davila.\"Afraid?--not in the least!\"\"No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?\"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,\nto see that all was ready for their reception.\"If you will come in,\" he said, \"I will show you to your apartment.\"\"Prison, you mean,\" said Davila.\"Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?\"\"However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to\nmake you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary\nquarters.--These two rooms are yours,\" he continued, throwing open the\ndoor.\"They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,\nbe disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less\nhampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen\nminutes--you will be ready?\"\"Yes, we shall be ready,\" said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired.\"They might be worse,\" Davila retorted.\"Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.\"\"The rooms aren't so bad,\" said Elaine, looking around.\"We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of\nchairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.\"\"They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it,\" she said.\"I think my face needs--Heavens!\"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?\"\"I've lost\nall my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.\"\"Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't\nmatter!\"\"We will have ample opportunity to put them to\nrights before Colin and Geoffrey see us.\"She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,\ndashed water on her face, and washed her hands.\"Now,\" she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was\ndoing likewise, \"if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed.\"Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,\nextended it.\"Here is some Papier Poudre,\" she said.Each narrative is\nfollowed by a versified version of it.A small book of hymns is added,\nsome of them composed by the martyrs; and the letters and confession of\none Joos de Tollenaer, who was put to death at Ghent in 1589.In 1615, a large collection of these narratives appeared at Haarlem in a\nthick 4to.The compilers were Hans de Ries, Jaques Outerman, and\nJoost Govertsoon, all eminent Mennonite ministers.Two editions followed\nfrom the press of Zacharias Cornelis at Hoorn in 1617 and 1626, both in\n4to., but under different editorship.The last edition was offensive to\nthe Haarlem editors, who therefore published a fourth at Haarlem in\n1631.As its title is brief, I will give it from the copy in my library:\n\n  \"Martelaers Spiegel der Werelose Christenen t' zedert A. D.Gedrukt tot Haarlem Bij Hans\n  Passchiers van Wesbusch.In't Jaer onses Heeren, 1631.\"The title-page is from a copperplate,\nand is adorned with eight small engravings, representing scenes of\nsuffering and persecution from scripture.The narratives of martyrs\nextends from 1524 to 1624.It is this work which forms the basis of Van\nBraght's.He added to it the whole of his first part, and also some\nadditional narratives in the second.To the best of his ability he\nverified the whole.These works are frequently referred to by Ottius in his _Annales\nAnabaptistici_ under the titles \"Martyrologium Harlemense\" and\n\"Martyrologium Hornanum.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.From a paper in the _Archivs fuer Kunde oesterreichischer\nGeschichtsquellen_, I learn that a MS.exists in the City library of\nHamburgh, with the following title:\n\n  \"Chronickel oder Denkbueechel darinnen mit kurtzen Begriffen, Was\n  sich vom 1524 Jar, Bis auff gegenwaertige Zeit, in der gemain\n  zuegetragen, vnd wie viel trewer Zeugen Jesu Christij die warheit\n  Gottes so riterlich mit irem bluet bezeugt.The work appears chiefly confined to a history of the Moravian\nAnabaptists: but from passages given by the writer, Herr Gregor Wolny,\nit is evident that it contains many of the narratives given by Van\nBraght.was written previous to 1592,\nwhen its writer or compiler died.Three continuators carried on the\nnarrations to 1654.The last date in it is June 7, 1654; when Daniel\nZwicker, in his own handwriting, records his settlement as pastor over a\nBaptist church.by Ottius, and by Fischer in\nhis _Tauben-kobel_, p.33., &c. For any additional particulars\nrespecting it, I should feel greatly obliged.It does not appear to be known to your correspondent that a translation\nof the second part of Van Braght's work has been commenced in this\ncountry, of which the first volume was issued by the Hanserd Knollys\nSociety last year.A translation of the entire work appeared in 1837, in\nPennsylvania, U. S., for the use of the Mennonite churches, emigrants\nfrom Holland and Germany to whom the language of their native land had\nbecome a strange tongue.).--The corresponding _German_\nword is _Spann-nagel-neu_, which may be translated as \"New from the\nstretching needle;\" and corroborates the meaning given by you.I may\nremark the French have no equivalent phrase.It is evidently a familiar\nallusion of the clothmakers of England and Germany.).--There is an old Club in this\ntown (Birmingham) called the \"Bear Club,\" and established (ut dic.)circa 1738, formerly of some repute.Among other legends of the Club, is\none, that in the centre of the ceiling of their dining-room was once a\ncarved rose, and that the members always drank as a first toast, to \"The\nhealth of the King,\" [under the rose], meaning the Pretender._Handel's Occasional Oratorio_ (Vol.).--The \"Occasional\nOratorio\" is a separate composition, containing an overture, 10\nrecitatives, 21 airs, 1 duet, and 15 choruses.It was produced in the\nyear 1745.It is reported, I know not on what authority, that the King\nhaving ordered Handel to produce a new oratorio on a given day, and the\nartist having answered that it was impossible to do it in the time\n(which must have been unreasonably short, to extort such a reply from\nthe intellect that produced _The Messiah_ in three weeks, and _Israel in\nEgypt_ in four), his Majesty deigned no other answer than that done it\nmust and should be, whether possible or not, and that the result was the\nputting forward of the \"Occasional Oratorio.\"The structure of the oratorio, which was evidently a very hurried\ncomposition, gives a strong air of probability to the anecdote.Evidently no libretto was written for it; the words tell no tale, are\ntotally unconnected, and not even always tolerable English, a fine\nchorus (p.Arnold) going to the words \"Him or his God we no fear.\"It is rather a collection of sacred pieces, strung together literally\nwithout rhyme or reason in the oratorio form, than one oratorio.The\nexamination of it leads one to the conclusion, that the composer took\nfrom his portfolio such pieces as he happened to have at hand, strung\nthem together as he best could, and made up the necessary quantity by\nselections from his other works.Accordingly we find in it the pieces\n\"The Horse and his Rider,\" \"Thou shalt bring them in,\" \"Who is like unto\nThee?\"\"The Hailstone Chorus,\" \"The Enemy said I will pursue,\" from\n_Israel in Egypt_, written in 1738; the chorus \"May God", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Liberty,\" which he afterwards (in 1746) employed in\n_Judas Maccabaeus_.Possibly some other pieces of this oratorio may be\nfound also in some of Handel's other works, not sufficiently stamped on\nmy memory for me to recognise them; but I may remark that the quantity\nof _Israel in Egypt_ found in it may perhaps have so connected it in\nsome minds with that glorious composition as to have led to the practice\nreferred to of prefixing in performance the overture to the latter work,\nto which, although the introductory movement, the fine adagio, and grand\nmarch are fit enough, the light character of the fugue is, it must be\nconfessed, singularly inappropriate.I am not aware of any other \"occasion\" than that of the King's will,\nwhich led to the composition of this oratorio.).--They are found in the ancient\nchurches in Ireland, and some are preserved in the Museum of the Royal\nIrish Academy, and in private collections.A beautiful specimen is\nengraved in Wakeman's _Handbook of Irish Antiquities_, p.).--The charge for a\n\"Thanksgiving Book,\" mentioned by A CHURCHWARDEN, was no doubt for a\nBook of Prayers, &c., on some general thanksgiving day, probably after\nthe battle of Blenheim and the taking of Gibraltar, which would be about\nthe month of November.A similar charge appears in the Churchwardens'\naccounts for the parish of _Eye, Suffolk_, at a much earlier period,\nviz.1684, which you may probably deem worthy of insertion in your\npages:\n\n      \"_Payments._                                      _l._ _s._ _d._\n\n      \"It.To Flegg for sweepinge and dressinge\n      upp the church the nynth\n      of September beeinge A day of\n      _Thanks-givinge_ for his Ma'ties\n      deliv'ance from the Newkett\n      Plot                                               00   03   00\n\n      \"It.For twoe _Bookes_ for the 9th of September\n      aforesaid                                          00   01   00\"\n\n    J.

H. P. as assigned to Plautus, and which he says he cannot\nfind in that author, occurs in one of the interpolated scenes in the\n_Mercator_, which are placed in some of the old editions between the 5th\nand 6th Scenes of Act IV.In the edition by Pareus, printed at Neustadt\n(Neapolis Nemetum) in 1619, 4to., it stands thus:\n\n  \"Verum id dictum est: Feliciter is sapit, qui periculo alieno\n  sapit.\"I was wrong in attributing it to Plautus, and should rather have called\nit _Plautine_.By a strange slip of the pen or the press, pericu_lum_ is\nput instead of pericu_lo_ in my note.Niebuhr has a very interesting\nessay on the interpolated scenes in Plautus, in the first volume of his\n_Kleine Historische und Philologische Schriften_, which will show why\nthese scenes and passages, marked as supposititious in some editions,\nare now omitted.It appears that they were made in the fifteenth century\nby Hermolaus Barbarus.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.See a letter from him to the Bishop of Segni, in\n_Angeli Politiani Epistolae_, lib.To the parallel thoughts already cited may be added the following:\n\n  \"Ii qui sciunt, quid aliis acciderit, facile ex aliorum eventu,\n  suis rationibus possunt providere.\"\"I' presi esempio de' lor stati rei,\n      Facendomi profitto l' altrui male\n      In consolar i casi e dolor miei.\"Petrarca, _Trionfo della Castita_.\"Ben' e felice quel, donne mie care,\n      Ch' essere accorto all' altrui spese impare.\"Fur._, canto X.\n\n    S.

Howbit since many impediments, as yet must detaine such\nmy observations in the shadow of darknesse, untill I shall be able to\ndeliver them perfect unto your judgments,\" etc.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.This is not, as has been assumed, a statement that the observations were\nnot written then, only that they were not \"perfect\"; in fact, they\nwere detained in the \"shadow of darknesse\" till the year 1849.Our\nown inference is, from all the circumstances, that Strachey began his\nmanuscript in Virginia or shortly after his return, and added to it and\ncorrected it from time to time up to 1616.We are now in a position to consider Strachey's allusions to Pocahontas.The first occurs in his description of the apparel of Indian women:\n\n\"The better sort of women cover themselves (for the most part) all over\nwith skin mantells, finely drest, shagged and fringed at the skyrt,\ncarved and coloured with some pretty work, or the proportion of beasts,\nfowle, tortayses, or other such like imagry, as shall best please or\nexpresse the fancy of the wearer; their younger women goe not shadowed\namongst their owne companie, until they be nigh eleaven or twelve\nreturnes of the leafe old (for soe they accompt and bring about the\nyeare, calling the fall of the leaf tagnitock); nor are thev much\nashamed thereof, and therefore would the before remembered Pocahontas,\na well featured, but wanton yong girle, Powhatan's daughter, sometymes\nresorting to our fort, of the age then of eleven or twelve yeares, get\nthe boyes forth with her into the markett place, and make them wheele,\nfalling on their hands, turning up their heeles upwards, whome she would\nfollowe and wheele so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over;\nbut being once twelve yeares, they put on a kind of semecinctum lethern\napron (as do our artificers or handycrafts men) before their bellies,\nand are very shamefac't to be seene bare.We have seene some use\nmantells made both of Turkey feathers, and other fowle, so prettily\nwrought and woven with threeds, that nothing could be discerned but the\nfeathers, which were exceedingly warme and very handsome.\"Strachey did not see Pocahontas.She did not resort to the camp after\nthe departure of Smith in September, 1609, until she was kidnapped by\nGovernor Dale in April, 1613.The\ntime mentioned by him of her resorting to the fort, \"of the age then of\neleven or twelve yeares,\" must have been the time referred to by Smith\nwhen he might have married her, namely, in 1608-9, when he calls her\n\"not past 13 or 14 years of age.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.The description of her as a \"yong\ngirle\" tumbling about the fort, \"naked as she was,\" would seem to\npreclude the idea that she was married at that time.The use of the word \"wanton\" is not necessarily disparaging, for\n\"wanton\" in that age was frequently synonymous with \"playful\" and\n\"sportive\"; but it is singular that she should be spoken of as \"well\nfeatured, but wanton.\"Strachey, however, gives in another place what is\nno doubt the real significance of the Indian name \"Pocahontas.\"He says:\n\n\"Both men, women, and children have their severall names; at first\naccording to the severall humor of their parents; and for the men\nchildren, at first, when they are young, their mothers give them a name,\ncalling them by some affectionate title, or perhaps observing their\npromising inclination give it accordingly; and so the great King\nPowhatan called a young daughter of his, whom he loved well, Pocahontas,\nwhich may signify a little wanton; howbeyt she was rightly called\nAmonata at more ripe years.\"The polygamous Powhatan had a large\nnumber of wives, but of all his women, his favorites were a dozen \"for\nthe most part very young women,\" the names of whom Strachey obtained\nfrom one Kemps, an Indian a good deal about camp, whom Smith certifies\nwas a great villain.Strachey gives a list of the names of twelve of\nthem, at the head of which is Winganuske.This list was no doubt written\ndown by the author in Virginia, and it is followed by a sentence,\nquoted below, giving also the number of Powhatan's children.The\n\"great darling\" in this list was Winganuske, a sister of Machumps,\nwho, according to Smith, murdered his comrade in the Bermudas.Strachey\nwrites:\n\n\"He [Powhatan] was reported by the said Kemps, as also by the Indian\nMachumps, who was sometyme in England, and comes to and fro amongst us\nas he dares, and as Powhatan gives him leave, for it is not otherwise\nsafe for him, no more than it was for one Amarice, who had his braynes\nknockt out for selling but a baskett of corne, and lying in the English\nfort two or three days without Powhatan's leave; I say they often\nreported unto us that Powhatan had then lyving twenty sonnes and ten\ndaughters, besyde a young one by Winganuske, Machumps his sister, and a\ngreat darling of the King's; and besides, younge Pocohunta, a daughter\nof his, using sometyme to our fort in tymes past, nowe married to a\nprivate Captaine, called Kocoum, some two years since.\"Does Strachey intend to say that\nPocahontas was married to an Iniaan named Kocoum?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.She might have been\nduring the time after Smith's departure in 1609, and her kidnapping\nin 1613, when she was of marriageable age.We shall see hereafter that\nPowhatan, in 1614, said he had sold another favorite daughter of his,\nwhom Sir Thomas Dale desired, and who was not twelve years of age, to\nbe wife to a great chief.The term \"private Captain\" might perhaps be\napplied to an Indian chief.Smith, in his \"General Historie,\" says\nthe Indians have \"but few occasions to use any officers more than one\ncommander, which commonly they call Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is\nCaptaine.\"It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to\ntwist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to\nsay that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance\nand Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means \"chief,\" and\nCaucorouse means \"talker\" or \"orator,\" and is the original of our word\n\"caucus.\"Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an\nIndian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact\nthat war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off\nintercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with\nRol", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "If this is to be accepted,\nthen this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have\nreferred to the marriage to Rolfe it \"some two years since,\" in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her\nacquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that\nshe was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian\ngirls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to\nsuppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,\nand exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no\nairs of royalty when she was \"cart-wheeling\" about the fort.Nor\ndoes this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and\nconverted, and partially civilized woman.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been\nnoticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept\na private secretary to register births in his family.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.If Pocahontas gave\nher age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,\naged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was\ncaptured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's\ncaptivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion\nas to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of\naffairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the\nage of eighteen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the apple.In marrying at least as early as that she would have\nfollowed the custom of her tribe.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.It is possible that her intercourse\nwith the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be\noffered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the \"General Historie\" are so\nevidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When\nand where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London\nportrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey\nsays she was \"at more ripe yeares.\"How she was occupied from the\ndeparture of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.To follow her\nauthentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of\nRalph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous\nin the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia\nin September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an\nexpedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture\nthat would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,\nhad become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall\nsays: \"I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great\nPowhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,\nwhither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any\nstratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as\nwere prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as\nhe and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our\nnation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief.\"By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and\nfriend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,\nPocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent\nto Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be\nreleased; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the\ntools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, \"much grieved,\" replied that if Argall would use his daughter\nwell, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede\nto all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to\nGovernor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days\nafter the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one\nbroad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,\nwas kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek\nwe can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her\nfriendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may\nbe that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,\nand murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,\nthough Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph\nHamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in\n1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)\n\"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there\ntill the 18th of June, 1614.\"Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in\nLondon who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:\n\n\"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas\n(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella\nof Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some\npleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at\nPataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as\nshopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for\ntheirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon\noccasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,\nwhom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,\nand delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be\nsurprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine\nArgall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and\nby what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or\nnever, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love\nwhich he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme\nsome of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,\npromising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well\nassured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,\npromised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and\nthus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been\nmost powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee\nhad thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would\naccompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should\nfaine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,\nwhich being there three or four times before she had never seene, and\nshould be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with\nher, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being\nwithout the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,\nmust faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)\nwhereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave\nher leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany\nher; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her\nfather's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet\nby her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,\nthe best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper\nthey went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to\nexpres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as\nwho should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was\nlodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have\nsome conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by\nwhat stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already\nrelated: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing\nmistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with\nfeere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be\ngon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper\nkittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,\nthat doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,\npermitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers\nconsiderations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe\nmen, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall\ntimes by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though\nof no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,\nwhereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet\nignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les\ndiscontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe\nthere was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary\ncurteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to\nJamestowne she was brought.\"Smith, who condenses this account in his \"General Historie,\" expresses\nhis contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: \"The old Jew and his\nwife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas.\"It will be noted\nthat the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her\ncapture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to\n\"Kocoum\" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a\ndemand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is\nrepresented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his \"delight and darling,\" it\nwas, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from\nhim.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.He\nretained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that\nPocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him\ntill the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with\nseveral vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's\nchief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance\nto fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen\ngoods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,\nreminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,\nkilled some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went\non up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's\nchief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and\narrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver\nwas held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which\nthey would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their\nsister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and\nsaw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to\npersuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The\ntwo brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master\nSparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show\nhimself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his\nbest efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to\nJamestown.\"Long before this time,\" Hamor relates, \"a gentleman of approved\nbehaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with\nPocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were\nin parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter\nfrom him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his\nlove, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and\nPocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith.\"Governor Dale\napproved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other\nconditions.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\"The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]\ncame soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as\nappeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent\nan old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the\nchurch, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was\naccordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have\nhad friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but\nalso with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the\ncollonie should not thrive a pace.\"This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm\npeace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the\ngrateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan\nhad been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,\nand of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as\nmembers of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish\nambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: \"Although some\nsuppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there\nis a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;\nforty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and\nare received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded\nfor reprehending it.\"John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the\nwelfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,\nwho gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at\nthe time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives\nhim the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,\nthe planting and raising of tobacco.\"No man [he adds] hath labored to\nhis power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England\nby his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's\ndaughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed\ngeneration, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and\nleast any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him\nhereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my\ntreatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas\nDale.\"The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to\na theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,\ninstead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the\nflutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a\ngreat resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved\nentirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:\n\n\"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make\nbetween God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the\ndreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be\nopened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be\nnot to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking\nof so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may\npermit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good\nof this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of\nGod, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge\nof God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so\nentangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even\nawearied to unwinde myself thereout.\"Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on\nthis subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind\nand his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.He is aware of God's\ndispleasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange\nwives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good\ncircumspection \"into the grounds and principall agitations which should\nthus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,\nher manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in\nall nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,\nI have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are\nwicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's\ndistruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such\ndiabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest.\"The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and\nconsequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,\nwhether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious\nreason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:\n\n\"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde\nanother, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest\nand strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,\nin a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions\nand sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe\nindured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,\nand carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a\ngood Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not\nindeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater\nwonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which\nin common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede\nforgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the apple there.He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the\nremedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:\n\n\"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I\nwas created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but\nto labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and\nincrease the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the\ngospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be\nreaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation\nin the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance\nof love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge\nof God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness\nto receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her\nowne incitements stirring me up hereunto.\"The \"incitements\" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: \"Shall I be of\nso untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right\nway?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or\nuncharitable, as not to cover the naked?\"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed\nup his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands\nof people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the\nsacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,\nand the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive\nhe vigorously repels: \"Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's\nactions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt\nmee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to\ngorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually\ninclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared\nconscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less\nfearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate\nan estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope\nbut one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in\nbirth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it\nplease God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill\nmy ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe\nappointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have\naccomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will\ndaily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness.\"It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to\nAmonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir\nThomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a\nreverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas\nwas carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on\nshore, \"she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best\nsort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not\nvalue her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would\nstill dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.\"\"Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully\ninstructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good\nprogress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly\nconfessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is\nsince married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his\nletter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may\nperceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father\nand friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in\nthe church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will\nincrease in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She\nwill goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one\nsoule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent.\"Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date\nwith the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness\nof which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale\nit says: \"But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the\ndaughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English\nGentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her\ncountrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was\nbaptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground\nher in.\"If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,\nthen Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for\nwedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had\nceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure\nwork of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It\nis not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her\ndetention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate\nof the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,\nboth of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious\nsubjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,\nfor it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to\nLondon.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may\nsuppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to\nconvert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever\nmay have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor\nDale that she lived \"civilly and lovingly\" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED\n\nSir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet\nGovernor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the\nchange in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had\nbeen held in common by the company, and there had been no division of\nproperty or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime\nland was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began\nat once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the\ncolonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort\nto fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital\npiety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,\nagainst \"scandalous imputation,\" entitled \"Leah and Rachel; or, The\nTwo Fruitful Sisters,\" by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers\nthe charges that Virginia \"is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,\nabandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable\nlabour, bad usage and hard diet\"; and admits that \"at the first\nsettling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these\naspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were\njails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision\nall brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees.\"Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a\nprivate he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States\nGeneral in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and\nfrugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a\nsoldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some\ninjurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,\nhe pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.Active operations for\nsettling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,\nthe Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the\nthree hundred that came were \"so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,\nthat not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and\ncrazed that not sixty of them may be employed.\"He served afterwards\nwith credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in\n1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and\ndied in 1620 from the effects of the climate.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.He was twice married, and\nhis second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him\nand received a patent for a Virginia plantation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to\nChristianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired\nhim with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose\nexquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,\nwith the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to\nthe court of Powhatan, \"upon a message unto him, which was to deale with\nhim, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas\nbeing already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight\nand darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer\npledge of peace.\"This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan\nhimself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,\nexpressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented\nto him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him\nleave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also\ninquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's\nland to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way\nto his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side.\"On each hand of\nhim was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called\nhis Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside\nguarded with a hundred bowmen.\"The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan \"first\ndrank,\" and then passed to Hamor, who \"drank\" what he pleased and then\nreturned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale\nfared, \"and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his\nunknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together.\"Hamor\nreplied \"that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well\ncontent that she would not change her life to return and live with him,\nwhereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it.\"Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and\nMr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without\nthe presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,\nwho already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may\nnever sequester themselves, and Mr.First there\nwas a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents\nof coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of\na grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then\nproceeded:\n\n\"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being\nfamous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your\nbrother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,\nto intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to\npermit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which\nhimselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of\nwhom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your\nbrother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife\nand bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which\nI entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me\nanswer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly\nunited together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in\nthe bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally\nbecause himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as\nhe liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee\nmay, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe\nthereunto.\"Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love\nand peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to\nthe other matter he said: \"My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold\nwithin these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels\nof Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true\nshe is already gone with him, three days' journey from me.\"Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; \"that if\nhe pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke\nwithout the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the\nrather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not\nmarriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the\nfirmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,\ncopper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him.\"The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have\nbrought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his\ndaughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted\nin none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her\noften, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he\nwas determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other\nassurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already\none of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;\n\"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine.\"And then", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded\nthem with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as\nsnow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him\nin return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: \"I\nhope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three\ndays' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more.\"It\nspeaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had\nfeasted his guests, \"he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some\nthree quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven\nyears since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all\nthis time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three\nspoonfuls.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his\nwife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six\nof the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the\ncredit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting\nan inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John\nRolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth\nearly in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: \"Sir Thomas\nDale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of\nthatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter\nof Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his\nwife with him into England.\"On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to\nSir Dudley Carlton that there were \"ten or twelve, old and young, of\nthat country.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great\ncare to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company\nhad to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living\nas a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same\nyear two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after\nbeing long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there\nget husbands, \"that after they were converted and had children, they\nmight be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them.\"The attempt to educate them in England was not\nvery successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this\ncomment from Sir Edwin Sandys:\n\n\"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he\nfound upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far\nfrom the Christian work intended.\"One Nanamack, a lad brought over by\nLord Delaware, lived some years in houses where \"he heard not much of\nreligion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and\nlike evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan,\" till he fell in with a\ndevout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the\nhusband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his \"Pilgrimes\":\n\"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master\nDoctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen\nhim sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of\nhis country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which\nI have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom\nherself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a\nking, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which\nallowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular\npersons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of\nLondon, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond\nwhat I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At\nher return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,\nhaving given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the\nfirst fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,\nand the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy\npermanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her\nblessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew\nnot and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own\nso appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me\nwith the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or\nDevil had taught them their husbandry.\"Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own\nimportance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or\n\"little booke\" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is\nfound in Smith's \"General Historie\" ( 1624), where it is introduced\nas having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of\nit.Whether the \"abstract\" in the \"General Historie\" is exactly like\nthe original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in\nSmith's memory than we have in his dates.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.The letter is as follows:\n\n\"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine.\"The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me\nin the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee\npresume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short\ndiscourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,\nI must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee\nthankful.\"That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the\npower of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage\nexceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the\nmost manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and\nhis sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,\nbeing but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose\ncompassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause\nto respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim\nattendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I\ncannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of\nthose my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After\nsome six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of\nmy execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save\nmine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was\nsafely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty\nmiserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those\nlarge territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore\nCommonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved.\"And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by\nthis Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant\nFortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not\nspare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,\nand our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to\nimploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or\nher extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am\nsure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought\nto surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not\naffright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered\neies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:\nwhich had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild\ntraine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during\nthe time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the\ninstrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter\nconfusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia\nmight have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since\nthen, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents\nfrom that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and\ntroublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our\nColonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,\nthe Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last\nrejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,\nwith whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of\nthat Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe\nin mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly\nconsidered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding.\"Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your\nbest leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done\nin the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented\nyou from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet\nI never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of\nabilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,\nher birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly\nto beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be\nfrom one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's\nestate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most\nand least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried\nit as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her\nstation: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome\nmay rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and\nChristianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all\nthis good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should\ndoe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to\nyour servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare\nher dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest\nsubjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious\nhands.\"The passage in this letter, \"She hazarded the beating out of her owne\nbraines to save mine,\" is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the\nparagraph which speaks of \"the exceeding great courtesie\" of Powhatan;\nand Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up\nhis\n\n\"General Historie.\"Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the\nfirst three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to\nNew England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the\nservice she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect\nof the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there\nSmith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only\none we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she\nhad supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He\nwrites:\n\n\"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured\nher face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband\nwith divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself\nto have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to\ntalke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You\ndid promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to\nyou; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the\nsame reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I\ndurst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With\na well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my\nfather's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and\nfear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and\nyou shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your\ncontrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other\ntill I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek\nyou, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much.\"'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by\nPowhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they\nand their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make\nnotches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that\ntask.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him\nto show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had\ntold so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had\nheard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably\nnot coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was\nconvinced he had seen him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Then he replied very sadly: \"You gave\nPowhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave\nme nothing, and I am better than your white dog.\"Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and \"they\ndid think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen\nmany English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;\" and\nhe heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,\nas also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both\nat the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but\nthe contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of\ncuriosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,\nand the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's \"Christmas his Mask\" at court, January\n6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain\nwrites to Carleton: \"The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father\ncounsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and\nher assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though\nsore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away.\"Neill says that \"after the first weeks of her residence in England\nshe does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter\nwriters,\" and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that \"when they heard that\nRolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he\nhad not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian\nprincesse.\"His interest in the colony was never\nthe most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of\nthe Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The\nKing very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was\nsure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, \"but that\nyou know so well how he is affected to these toys.\"There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a\nportrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is\ntranslated: \"Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,\nEmperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died\non shipboard at Gravesend 1617.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.This is doubtless the portrait engraved\nby Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the\nLondon edition of the \"General Historie,\" 1624.It is not probable that\nthe portrait was originally published with the \"General Historie.\"The\nportrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:\n\nRound the portrait:\n\n\"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim.\"In the oval, under the portrait:\n\n         \"Aetatis suae 21 A.1616\"\nBelow:\n\n\"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of\nAttanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian\nfaith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his \"History of Gravesend\" says that everybody paid this\nyoung lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have\nsufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her\nown country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the\nEnglish; and that she died, \"giving testimony all the time she lay sick,\nof her being a very good Christian.\"The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at\nGravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably\non the 21st of March, 1617.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.I have seen somewhere a statement, which\nI cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,\nwhere she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of\nthat church has this record:\n\n\n       \"1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe\n        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent\n     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried\n          in ye chaunncle.\"Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State\nPapers, dated \"1617, 29 March, London,\" that her death occurred March\n21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became\nGovernor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that\nunscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the\ncompany.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: \"We cannot\nimagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives\nhave given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it\nfrom all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some\ndo here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for\nyourself.\"It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that\nLady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands\nin Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and\nMr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late \"Lord Deleware had\ncome into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him.\"This George\nSandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish\nEmpire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book\nwritten in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's\n\"Metamorphosis.\"John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his\nmarriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his\nbrother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be\nconverted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own\nindemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas\nto the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil\npractices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle\nHenry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned\nto Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his\napplication to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the\nIndian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only\ndaughter who was married, says Stith (1753), \"to Col.John Bolling; by\nwhom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father\nto the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to\nCol.Campbell in his \"History of Virginia\"\nsays that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an\nesteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,\ngrandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the\ngreat granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with\nfighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;\nhis own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,\nand usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and\nconquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not\ndefined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the\nPotomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he\nalternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of\nwhich at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey\n(York) River.He is said\nto have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the\nyoungest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his\nharem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into\nall his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to\nselect.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:\n\"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold\nand stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes\nand attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is\nsupposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how\nmuch more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a\nsad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,\nhanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so\non his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,\nvigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath\nbeen, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and\nthat to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,\nas also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in\nsecurity and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions\nof peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is\nlikewise more quietly settled amongst his own.\"It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives\nwhom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,\npresenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,\nor tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on\nburning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put\non such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to\nthe necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: \"Such is (I believe)\nthe impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other\nheathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the\nknowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an\ninfused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall\nbe so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on\nearth.\"Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the\nappearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed\nby Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or\nconjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept\nand conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but\npropitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception\nof an overruling power or of an immortal life.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the milk.Smith describes a\nceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity;

theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as\nsometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the\nground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never\nobserved the like.\"It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of\nthose in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they\ngot a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth\nand the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either\naccording to the custom of the country or as a defense against the\nstinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says\nStrachey; \"howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so\ndiscolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth\nhow they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the\nwomen,\" \"dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming\nit the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden\nquince is of,\" as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient\nBritain women dyed themselves with red;

no\nbeards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at\nthe end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as\nthe Moors; and the women as having \"handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty\nhands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as\nbarbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an\nell long.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple.A Puritan divine--\"New England's Plantation, 1630\"--says of\nthe Indians about him, \"their hair is generally black, and cut before\nlike our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to\nour gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England.\"Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from\nStrachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:\n\n\"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in\nthe same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white\nbone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up\nhollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,\nhawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,\nsquirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke\nto the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these\nholes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard\nin length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes\nfamiliarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt\ntyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums.\"This is the earliest use I find of our word \"conundrum,\" and the sense\nit bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves\nhis prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight\nagainst the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for\nthe crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is\nsomething pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death\nof his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun\nby the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege\nof moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him\npeace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, \"tender and true.\"Wanting apparently the\ncruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the\nheart.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle\nwords for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of\na gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has\nwoven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later\nwriters have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts\nthat industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and\nunrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters\nin her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the\nappearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so\ninclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt\nto learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those\nwho taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,\nsensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something\nmore than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger\nand a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who\nopposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in\ncivilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight\nof a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural\nto a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than\nefforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the\nwhites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the\nsupport of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on\nsight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed\nwhites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a\nbase violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to\nher situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her\ncaptors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,\nthat her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always\nremains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained\nby the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her\nadopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian\nname she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than\nshe left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre\nof 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she\nmight have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles\nof the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying\nwhen she did,", "question": "Where is the apple?

it could not be\ndiscovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make\nhim reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,\ncoining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say\nthat if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain\nhimself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of\nno great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young\ngentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,\nmusic, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an\nexcellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a\npoet;

leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,\nand three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and\nsuch longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton\nchurch, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless\nat the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts;

but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many\nexecuted at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable\nextent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the\nnominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,\nwhere I found a family of ten children, five sons and five\ndaughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All\npainted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,\nand seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the\nchildren of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished\nas to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,\nin that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing\ncolumns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece\nof architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like\ndrawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the\nbuilding beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star\nfrom a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be\nbuilt by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of\nthose at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the\nState.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come\non the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had\na paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was\nput out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers\nconsiderable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a\nFrench refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the\nReformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much\ndiscourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning\nthe _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a\ntime when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure\nhim (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an\napothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion\nof it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very\nhonest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only\nthing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his\nphysicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being\nasked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it\nwould spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last\nconfessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that\nthe late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office\nfor the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which\nI thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,\npiety, and prudence.He being my\nproxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very\nmortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.13th January, 1694-95.The deaths by\nsmallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The\nKing and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court\nat Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House;

all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred\npoor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded\nand covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,\naldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,\nwho related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,\nwhich was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,\nwho were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was\nfound wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any\nextraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This\npaper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent\nthings under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were\nvery small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in\nany private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for\ntaking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo\nthe renowned Queen Elizabeth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought\nat the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was\nthe very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I\nbelieve in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;\nbut the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was\nlet fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's \"Britannia\" was now published (by Bishop\nGibson), with great additions;

account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or\nL8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the\nArchbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers\nin the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,\nand garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual\nArchbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished\nby his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,\nparticularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing\ndone.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of\nall the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for\nmarriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading\nthe names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]\n\n19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady\nis aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went\nthence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,\nparson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not\nalways seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set\nharvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much\ncontroversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a\ncruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The\nseason wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and\nworthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to\nlive decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the\nEast Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French\nmen-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,\nto my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and\nindustrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been\nimmense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same\nnear our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than\nspending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,\nwithout any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,\nought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or\nChristianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my\nson Draper, died suddenly.His lady being\nown aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no\nheir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich\nhospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,\nbut I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very\nsharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the\nnorth, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was\neverywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he\nexpected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the\ntheater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some\nancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and\nlearned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was\nencouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to\nvisit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying\nsight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;\nalso his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other\npretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had\nerected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an\ninscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most\nperfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books\nsix feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He\nplays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at\nWhitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,\nfor matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent\nconversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King\nbeing returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord\nSunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These\nfireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest\nhimself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the\nbooks want place.Williams continued in Boyle's\nlectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite\nand underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being\nobnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform\nthe coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of\nhalf-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.12th January, 1695-96.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the\nclipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to\ncold.The \"Royal Sovereign\" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built\nin 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps\nthe cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in\nDorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for\na large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of\nthat material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty\nknights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,\nand Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the\nfirst opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or\nto the chapel;

but so it pleased God that Admiral\nRooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,\nwith others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,\nand were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could\nbe got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look\non it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of\nGod.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design\nof assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his\nfriends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King\nWilliam.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so\nmany of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding\ntheir design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and\nDunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they\nwere so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their\nmasts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to\nhave invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,\nwhereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate\nthe King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of\ninciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and\nsome very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John\nFriend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at\nTemple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was\nsuch at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles\nII., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]\n\n    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into\n    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who\nabsolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)\nwas a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to\nthe canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee\nabout settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years\na more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the\nKing's House at Kensington.The\ngallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of\nTitian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,\nTintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty\nprivate library.His prayer before\nthe sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with\nfifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous\ntrain of gallants.Oates\ndedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he\npresumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,\nspeaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own\nfather.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,\nthe Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult\nabout settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded\nupon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our\nhands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of\nSunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's\napartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at\nnight.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from\nIreland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that\nnone was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying\nfor common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all\nlawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged\nto renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King\nWilliam's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all\nthe Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's\nBench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the\noath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the\nParliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and\nothers surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,\nwere now discharged out of prison.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to\nworkmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]\n\n1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to\nletting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition\nto keep up the garden.And before his eyes\nuprises another face--a young, bright, dauntless face, with fearless\ngrey eyes--the the face of Ruby\u2019s mother, who would have gone through\nfire and water for the sake of the man she loved; but who, in her quiet\nScottish home, had not been called upon to do any great thing, only to\nleave her husband and child when the King called her away to that other\nland which is fairer even than the dearly loved bonnie Scotland she\nleft behind.It is no one\u2019s fault that the wrong woman seems to have been put in\nthe wrong place, that the fearless Scottish lassie who would fain have\nproved her love for her husband by braving peril and hardship for his\nsake, had comfortable circumstances and a peaceful life for her lot,\nand that the fair-faced, ease-loving woman who came after her should\nhave had to brave those very hardships which the first had coveted.To Ruby her own mother is nothing more than a name, and Scotland itself\nnot much more.She was only three years old when the new golden-haired\nmother came home, and but little more when the reverses followed which\nforced her father to seek his fortune in an unknown land over the sea.And Australia is now, as Ruby has said to Jenny, \u201chome.\u201d\n\nThe child goes dancing off, and across the sunshine of the quadrangle\nto tell Jenny to bring the Christmas dinner in.It is a dinner which is\nmuch too hot for an Australian bush Christmas;

but Ruby is far away from it all, away\nin bonnie Scotland, with its rippling burns and purple heather, away\nin the land where her mother lived and died, and where Ruby\u2019s own baby\neyes first opened.\u201cIt\u2019s about too good to be true,\u201d the little girl is thinking.\u201cIt\u2019s\nlike dreaming, and then you waken from the dream and find it\u2019s all just\na make-up.What if this was a dream too?\u201d\n\nIt is not a dream, as Ruby finds after she has dealt herself several\nsharp pinches, her most approved method of demonstrating to herself\nthat reality really is reality.No dream, she has found by experience,\ncan long outlast such treatment.But by-and-by even reality passes into dreaming, and Ruby goes to\nsleep, the rippling of the creek in her ears, and the sunshine of the\nChristmas afternoon falling aslant upon her face.In her dreams the splash of the creek is transformed into the babble of\na Highland burn over the stones, and the sunshine is the sunshine of\ndear, unknown, bonnie Scotland.\u201cAs I lay a-thynkynge, a-thynkynge, a-thynkynge,\n  Merrie sang the birde as she sat upon the spraye!There came a noble knyghte,\n      With his hauberke shynynge brighte,\n      And his gallant heart was lyghte,\n          Free and gaye;\n  As I lay a-thynkynge, he rode upon his waye.\u201d\n\n                                         INGOLDSBY.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.Ruby always remembers the day that Jack came to the station.It is the twenty-sixth day of December, the day after Christmas, and\nRuby, having busied herself about the house most of the morning, in her\nusual small way, has gone down to the creek to do Fanny and Bluebell\u2019s\nwashing.There is no reason in the world why those young ladies\u2019 washing should\nnot be undertaken in the privacy of the kitchen, save that Jenny, in\nan inadvertent moment, has enlightened her young mistress as to the\nprimitive Highland way of doing washing, and has, moreover, shown her a\ntiny wood-cut of the same, carefully preserved in her large-print Bible.It is no matter to Ruby that the custom is now almost obsolete.The\nmain thing is that it is Scottish, and Scottish in every respect Ruby\nhas quite determined to be.Fanny and Bluebell sit in upright waxen and wooden silence against a\nstone, wrapped each in a morsel of calico, as most of their garments\nare now immersed in water.Bluebell is a brunette of the wooden-jointed\nspecies, warranted to outlive the hardest usage at the hands of her\nyoung owner.She has lost the roses from her cheeks, the painted wig\nfrom her head, one leg, and half an arm, in the struggle for existence;\nbut Bluebell is still good for a few years more wear.The painted wig\nRuby has restored from one of old Hans\u2019 paint-pots when he renewed the\nstation outbuildings last summer; but the complexion and the limbs are\nbeyond her power.And what is the use of giving red cheeks to a doll\nwhose face is liable to be washed at least once a day?Fanny, the waxen blonde, has fared but little better.Like Bluebell,\nshe is one-legged, and possesses a nose from which any pretensions to\nwax have long been worn away by too diligent use of soap and water.Her flaxen head of hair is her own, and so are her arms, albeit those\nlatter limbs are devoid of hands.Dolls have no easier a time of it in\nthe Australian bush than anywhere else.It is not amiss, this hot December morning, to paddle one\u2019s hands in\nthe cooling water, and feel that one is busily employed at the same\ntime.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.The sun beats down on the large white hat so diligently bent\nabove the running creek.Ruby, kneeling on a large boulder, is busily\nengaged wringing out Bluebell\u2019s pink calico dress, when a new idea\ncomes to her.She will \u201ctramp\u201d the clothes as they are doing in the\npicture of the \u201cHighland washing.\u201d\n\nSuch an idea is truly delightful, and Ruby at once begins to put it\ninto practice by sitting down and unbuttoning her shoes.But the hand\nunfastening the second button pauses, and the face beneath the large\nwhite hat is uplifted, the brown eyes shining.The sound of horse\u2019s\nhoofs is coming nearer and nearer.\u201cIt\u2019s dad!\u201d Ruby\u2019s face is aglow now.\u201cHe\u2019s come back earlier than he\nthought.\u201d\n\nThe washing is all forgotten, and flying feet make for the little side\ngarden-gate, where the rider is in a leisurely manner dismounting from\nhis horse.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.\u201cOh, dad!\u201d the little girl cries, then pauses, for surely this figure\nis not her father\u2019s.Ruby pulls down her hat, the better to see, and\nlooks up at him.He is giving his horse in charge to brown-faced Dick,\nand, raising his hat, comes towards Ruby.\u201cGood morning,\u201d he says politely, showing all his pretty even white\nteeth in a smile.\u201cThis is Glengarry, is it not?I am on my way to the\ncoast, and was directed to Mr.Thorne\u2019s as the nearest station.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returns Ruby, half shyly, \u201cthis is Glengarry.Mamma is at home, though papa is away.\u201d\n\nRuby knows quite what to do in the circumstances.Strangers do not come\noften to Glengarry; but still they come sometimes.He is of middle stature, with rather a tendency to stoop, and is of a\ncomplexion which would be delicate were it not so sunburnt, with light\nbrown hair, dark brown eyes, and a smile which lights up his face like\nsunlight as he speaks.Ruby leads him along the verandah, where the flowering plants twine up\nthe pillars, and into the room with the shady blue blinds.\u201cIt\u2019s a gentleman, mamma,\u201d Ruby gives as introduction.\u201cHe is on his\nway to the coast.\u201d\n\nWhen Ruby has finished her washing, spread out all the small garments\nto dry and bleach upon the grass, and returned to the house, she finds\nthe stranger still there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.The mistress had said he was to wait over\ndinner, so she learns from Jenny.\u201cOh, there you are, Ruby!\u201d her step-mother says as the little girl\ncomes into the room.Kirke\nfancies you must have been shy of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle girls often are,\u201d says Mr.Kirke, with that smile which\nillumines an otherwise plain face.\u201cThey think I\u2019m cross.\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ don\u2019t think so!\u201d decides Ruby, suddenly.She is gazing up into\nthose other brown eyes above her, and is fascinated, as most others\nare, by Jack Kirke\u2019s face--a face stern in repose, and far from\nbeautiful, but lit up by a smile as bright as God\u2019s own sunlight, and\nas kind.\u201c_You_ don\u2019t think so?\u201d repeats the young man, with another smile for\nthe fair little face uplifted to his.He puts his arm round the child\nas he speaks, and draws her towards him.\u201cYou are the little girl who\nthinks such a lot of Scotland,\u201d Jack Kirke says.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Ruby questions, looking up with wide brown eyes.\u201cI rather think a little bird must have sung it to me as I came along,\u201d\nthe stranger answers gravely.\u201cBesides, I\u2019m Scotch, so of course I\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh-h!\u201d ejaculates Ruby, her eyes growing bigger then.\u201cTell me about\nScotland.\u201d\n\nSo, with one arm round Ruby, the big brown eyes gazing up into the\nhonest ones above her, and the sunshine, mellowed by the down-drawn\nblinds, flooding on the two brown heads, Jack Kirke tells the little\ngirl all about the unknown land of Scotland, and his birthplace, the\ngrey little seaport town of Greenock, on the beautiful river Clyde.\u201cYou must come and see me if ever you come to Scotland, you know,\nRuby,\u201d he tells her.\u201cI\u2019m on my way home now, and shall be jolly glad\nto get there;

but its radiance has died\naway from Jack Kirke\u2019s face, leaving it for the moment cold and stern.Ruby is half frightened as she looks up at him.What has chased the\nbrightness from the face a moment ago so glad?\u201cWhen you are as old as dad and I you will be thankful if you can say\njust that, little girl,\u201d he says in a strange, strained voice.Kirke is sorry about something, though she\ndoes not know what, and, child-like, seeks to comfort him in the grief\nshe does not know.Again that flash of sunlight illumines the stern young face.The\nchild\u2019s words of ready sympathy have fallen like summer rain into the\nheart of the stranger far from home and friends, and the grief she does\nnot even understand is somehow lessened by her innocent words.\u201cRuby,\u201d he says suddenly, looking into the happy little face so near\nhis own, \u201cI want you to do something for me.Nobody has called me that since I left home, and it would make it\nfeel like old times to hear you say it.Don\u2019t be afraid because I\u2019m too\nold.It isn\u2019t so very long ago since I was young like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack,\u201d whispers Ruby, almost shyly.\u201cGood little girl!\u201d Jack Kirke says approvingly.A very beautiful light\nis shining in his brown eyes, and he stoops suddenly and kisses the\nwondering child.\u201cI must send you out a Christmas present for that,\u201d\nJack adds.A new doll?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must excuse me, Mr.Kirke,\u201d the lady of the house observes\napologetically as she comes back to the room.She has actually taken\nthe trouble to cross the quadrangle to assist Jenny in sundry small\nmatters connected with the midday meal.\u201cI am sorry I had to leave you\nfor a little,\u201d Mrs.\u201cI hope Ruby has been entertaining\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby is a hostess in herself,\u201d Jack Kirke returns, laughing.\u201cI\u2019m to go to see him in Scotland.Jack\nsays so, in Green--Green----I can\u2019t remember the name of the place; but\nit\u2019s where they build ships, beside the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby!\u201d her step-mother remonstrates, horror-stricken.\u201cWho\u2019s Jack?\u201d\n\n\u201cHim!\u201d cries Ruby, triumphantly, a fat forefinger denoting her\nnew-found friend.\u201cHe said I was to call him Jack,\u201d explains the little\ngirl.\u201cDidn\u2019t you, Jack?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d that young man says good-naturedly.\u201cAnd promised to\nsend you a doll for doing it, the very best that Greenock or Glasgow\ncan supply.\u201d\n\nIt is evident that the pair have vowed eternal friendship--a friendship\nwhich only grows as the afternoon goes on.Thorne comes home he insists that the young Scotchman shall\nstay the night, which Jack Kirke is nothing loth to do.Ruby even\ndoes him the honour of introducing him to both her dolls and to her\nbleaching green, and presents him with supreme dignity to Jenny as \u201cMr.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.Kirke, a gentleman from Scotland.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish next Christmas wasn\u2019t so far away, Jack,\u201d Ruby says that\nevening as they sit on the verandah.\u201cIt\u2019s such a long time till ever\nwe see you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you never saw me before this morning,\u201d says the young man,\nlaughing.He is both pleased and flattered by the affection which the\nlittle lady has seen fit to shower upon him.\u201cAnd I dare say that by\nthis time to-morrow you will have forgotten that there is such a person\nin existence,\u201d Jack adds teasingly.\u201cWe won\u2019t ever forget you,\u201d Ruby protests loyally.He\u2019s just the nicest \u2018stranger\u2019 that ever came to Glengarry since we\ncame.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a decided compliment for you, Mr.\u201cI\u2019m getting quite jealous of your attentions, little woman.It\nis well you are not a little older, or Mr.Kirke might find them very\nmuch too marked.\u201d\n\nThe white moonlight is flooding the land when at length they retire to\nrest.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.Ruby\u2019s dreams are all of her new-found friend whom she is so soon\nto lose, and when she is awakened by the sunlight of the newer morning\nstreaming in upon her face a rush of gladness and of sorrow strive\nhard for mastery in her heart--gladness because Jack is still here,\nsorrow because he is going away.Her father is to ride so far with the traveller upon his way, and Ruby\nstands with dim eyes at the garden-gate watching them start.\u201cGood-bye, little Ruby red,\u201d Jack Kirke says as he stoops to kiss her.\u201cRemember next Christmas, and remember the new dolly I\u2019m to send you\nwhen I get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Jack,\u201d Ruby whispers in a choked voice.\u201cI\u2019ll always\nremember you; and, Jack, if there\u2019s any other little girl in Scotland\nyou\u2019ll perhaps like better than me, I\u2019ll try not to mind _very_ much.\u201d\n\nJack Kirke twirls his moustache and smiles.There _is_ another little\ngirl in the question, a little girl whom he has known all her life,\nand who is all the world to her loyal-hearted lover.The only question\nnow at issue is as to whether Jack Kirke is all the world to the woman\nwhom, he has long since decided, like Geraint of old, is the \u201cone maid\u201d\nfor him.Then the two riders pass out into the sunshine, Jack Kirke with a last\nlook back and a wave of the hand for the desolate little blue figure\nleft standing at the gate.\u201cTill next Christmas, Ruby!\u201d his voice rings out cheerily, and then\nthey are gone, through a blaze of sunlight which shines none the\ndimmer because Ruby sees it through a mist of tears.It is her first remembered tasting of that most sorrowful of all words,\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d a good-bye none the less bitter that the \u201cgood morning\u201d\ncame to her but in yesterday\u2019s sunshine.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.It is not always those whom we\nhave known the longest whom we love the best.Even the thought of the promised new doll fails to comfort the little\ngirl in this her first keenest sorrow of parting.For long she stands\nat the gate, gazing out into the sunlight, which beats down hotly upon\nher uncovered head.\u201cIt\u2019s only till next Christmas anyway,\u201d Ruby murmurs with a shadowy\nattempt at a smile.\u201cAnd it won\u2019t be so _very_ long to pass.\u201d\n\nShe rubs her eyes with her hand as she speaks, and is almost surprised,\nwhen she draws it away, to find a tear there.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward\n    men.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMay?\u201d Ruby says.\u201cI wonder who that can be?\u201d\n\nShe turns the card with its illuminated wreath of holly and\nconventional glistening snow scene this way and that.\u201cIt\u2019s very\npretty,\u201d the little girl murmurs admiringly.\u201cBut who can \u2018May\u2019 be?\u201d\n\nThe Christmas card under inspection has been discovered by Jenny upon\nthe floor of the room where Mr.Jack Kirke has spent the night, dropped\nthere probably in the hurried start of the morning.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.It has evidently\nbeen a very precious thing in its owner\u2019s eyes, this card; for it is\nwrapped in a little piece of white tissue paper and enclosed in an\nunsealed envelope.Jenny has forthwith delivered this treasure over\nto Ruby, who, seated upon the edge of the verandah, is now busily\nscrutinizing it.\u201cJack, from May,\u201d is written upon the back of the card in a large\ngirlish scrawl.That is all; there is no date, no love or good wishes\nsent, only those three words: \u201cJack, from May;\u201d and in front of the\ncard, beneath the glittering snow scene and intermingling with the\nscarlet wreath, the Christmas benediction: \u201cGlory to God in the\nhighest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s May, I wonder,\u201d Ruby murmurs again, almost jealously.\u201cP\u2019raps\nanother little girl in Scotland he never told me about.I wonder why he\ndidn\u2019t speak about her.\u201d\n\nRuby does not know that the \u201cMay\u201d of the carefully cherished card is\na little girl of whom Jack but rarely speaks, though she lives in his\nthoughts day and night.Far away in Scotland a blue-eyed maiden\u2019s heart\nis going out in longing to the man who only by his absence had proved\nto the friend of his childhood how much she loved him.Her heart is in\nsunny Australia, and his in bonnie Scotland, all for love each of the\nother.Having failed, even with the best intentions to discover who May is,\nRuby turns her attention to the picture and the text.\u201c\u2018Glory to God in the highest,\u2019\u201d the little girl reads--\u201cthat\u2019s out of\nthe Bible--\u2018and on earth peace, good will toward men.\u2019 I wonder what\n\u2018good will\u2019 means?I s\u2019pose p\u2019raps it just means to be kind.\u201d\n\nAll around the child is the monotonous silence of the Australian noon,\nunbroken save by the faint silvery wash of the creek over the stones\non its way to the river, and the far-away sound of old Hans\u2019 axe as he\n\u201crings\u201d the trees.To be \u201ckind,\u201d that is what the Christmas text means\nin Ruby\u2019s mind, but there is no one here to be \u201ckind\u201d to.\u201cAnd of course that card would be made in Scotland, where there are\nlots of people to be kind to,\u201d the little girl decides thoughtfully.She is gazing out far away over the path which leads to the coast.Beyond that lies the sea, and beyond the sea Scotland.What would not\nRuby give to be in bonnie Scotland just now!The child rises and goes through the house and across the courtyard\nto the stables.The stables are situated on the fourth side of the\nquadrangle; but at present are but little used, as most of the horses\nare grazing at their own sweet will in the adjoining paddock just now.Dick comes out of the coach-house pulling his forelock.This building\nis desolate save for a very dilapidated conveyance termed \u201cbuggy\u201d in\nAustralia.\u201cWantin\u2019 to go for a ride, Miss Ruby?\u201d Dick asks.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the football.Dick is Ruby\u2019s\ncavalier upon those occasions when she desires to ride abroad.\u201cSmuttie\u2019s out in the paddock.I\u2019ll catch him for you if you like,\u201d he\nadds.\u201cBring him round to the gate,\u201d his young mistress says.\u201cI\u2019ll have got\non my things by the time you\u2019ve got him ready.\u201d\n\nSmuttie is harnessed and ready by the time Ruby reappears.He justifies\nhis name, being a coal-black pony, rather given over to obesity, but a\ngood little fellow for all that.Dick has hitched his own pony to the\ngarden-gate, and now stands holding Smuttie\u2019s bridle, and awaiting his\nlittle mistress\u2019s will.The sun streams brightly down upon them as they start, Ruby riding\nslowly ahead.In such weather Smuttie prefers to take life easily.It\nis with reluctant feet that he has left the paddock at all; but now\nthat he has, so to speak, been driven out of Eden, he is resolved in\nhis pony heart that he will not budge one hair\u2019s-breadth quicker than\nnecessity requires.Dick has fastened a handkerchief beneath his broad-brimmed hat, and his\nyoung mistress is not slow to follow his example and do the same.\u201cHot enough to start a fire without a light,\u201d Dick remarks from behind\nas they jog along.\u201cI never saw one,\u201d Ruby returns almost humbly.She knows that Dick\nrefers to a bush fire, and that for a dweller in the bush she ought\nlong before this to have witnessed such a spectacle.\u201cI suppose it\u2019s\nvery frightsome,\u201d Ruby adds.I should just think so!\u201d Dick ejaculates.He laughs to\nhimself at the question.\u201cSaw one the last place I was in,\u201d the boy\ngoes on.Your pa\u2019s never had one\nhere, Miss Ruby; but it\u2019s not every one that\u2019s as lucky.It\u2019s just\nlike\u201d--Dick pauses for a simile--\u201clike a steam-engine rushing along,\nfor all the world, the fire is.Then you can see it for miles and miles\naway, and it\u2019s all you can do to keep up with it and try to burn on\nahead to keep it out.If you\u2019d seen one, Miss Ruby, you\u2019d never like to\nsee another.\u201d\n\nRounding a thicket, they come upon old Hans, the German, busy in his\nemployment of \u201cringing\u201d the trees.This ringing is the Australian\nmethod of thinning a forest, and consists in notching a ring or circle\nabout the trunks of the trees, thus impeding the flow of sap to the\nbranches, and causing in time their death.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.The trees thus \u201cringed\u201d\nform indeed a melancholy spectacle, their long arms stretched bare and\nappealingly up to heaven, as if craving for the blessing of growth now\nfor ever denied them.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.The old German raises his battered hat respectfully to the little\nmistress.\u201cHot day, missie,\u201d he mutters as salutation.\u201cYou must be dreadfully hot,\u201d Ruby says compassionately.The old man\u2019s face is hot enough in all conscience.He raises his\nbroad-brimmed hat again, and wipes the perspiration from his damp\nforehead with a large blue-cotton handkerchief.\u201cIt\u2019s desp\u2019rate hot,\u201d Dick puts in as his item to the conversation.\u201cYou ought to take a rest, Hans,\u201d the little girl suggests with ready\ncommiseration.He doesn\u2019t like me to do\nthings when it\u2019s so hot, and he wouldn\u2019t like you either.Your face is\njust ever so red, as red as the fire, and you look dreadful tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAch!and I _am_ tired,\u201d the old man ejaculates, with a broad smile.But a little more work, a little more tiring out,\nand the dear Lord will send for old Hans to be with Him for ever in\nthat best and brightest land of all.The work has\nnot come to those little hands of thine yet, but the day may come when\nthou too wilt be glad to leave the toil behind thee, and be at rest.but what am I saying?\u201d The smile broadens on the tired old face.\u201cWhy do I talk of death to thee, _liebchen_, whose life is all play?The sunlight is made for such as thee, on whom the shadows have not\neven begun to fall.\u201d\n\nRuby gives just the tiniest suspicion of a sob stifled in a sniff.\u201cYou\u2019re not to talk like that, Hans,\u201d she remonstrates in rather an\ninjured manner.\u201cWe don\u2019t want you to die--do we, Dick?\u201d she appeals to\nher faithful servitor.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.\u201cNo more\u2019n we don\u2019t,\u201d Dick agrees.\u201cSo you see,\u201d Ruby goes on with the air of a small queen, \u201cyou\u2019re not\nto say things like", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "And I\u2019ll tell dad you\u2019re not to\nwork so hard; dad always does what I want him to do--usually.\u201d\n\nThe old man looks after the two retreating figures as they ride away.\u201cShe\u2019s a dear little lady, she is,\u201d he mutters to himself.\u201cBut she\ncan\u2019t be expected to understand, God bless her!how the longing comes\nfor the home-land when one is weary.Good Lord, let it not be long.\u201d\nThe old man\u2019s tired eyes are uplifted to the wide expanse of blue,\nbeyond which, to his longing vision, lies the home-land for which he\nyearns.Then, wiping his axe upon his shirt-sleeve, old Hans begins his\n\u201cringing\u201d again.\u201cHe\u2019s a queer old boy,\u201d Dick remarks as they ride through the sunshine.Though a servant, and obliged to ride behind, Dick sees no reason why\nhe should be excluded from conversation.She would have\nfound those rides over the rough bush roads very dull work had there\nbeen no Dick to talk to.\u201cHe\u2019s a nice old man!\u201d Ruby exclaims staunchly.\u201cHe\u2019s just tired, or\nhe wouldn\u2019t have said that,\u201d she goes on.She has an idea that Dick is\nrather inclined to laugh at German Hans.They are riding along now by the river\u2019s bank, where the white clouds\nfloating across the azure sky, and the tall grasses by the margin are\nreflected in its cool depths.About a mile or so farther on, at the\nturn of the river, a ruined mill stands, while, far as eye can reach on\nevery hand, stretch unending miles of bush.Dick\u2019s eyes have been fixed\non the mill; but now they wander to Ruby.\u201cWe\u2019d better turn \u2019fore we get there, Miss Ruby,\u201d he recommends,\nindicating the tumbledown building with the willowy switch he has been\nwhittling as they come along.\u201cThat\u2019s the place your pa don\u2019t like you\nfor to pass--old Davis, you know.Your pa\u2019s been down on him lately for\nstealing sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure dad won\u2019t mind,\u201d cries Ruby, with a little toss of the head.\u201cAnd I want to go,\u201d she adds, looking round at Dick, her bright face\nflushed with exercise, and her brown hair flying behind her like a\nveritable little Amazon.Dick knows by sore experience that when\nthis little lady wants her own way she usually gets it.\u201cYour pa said,\u201d he mutters; but it is all of no avail, and they\ncontinue their course by the river bank.The cottage stands with its back to the river, the mill, now idle and\nunused, is built alongside.Once on a day this same mill was a busy\nenough place, now it is falling to decay for lack of use, and no sign\nor sound either there or at the cottage testify to the whereabouts of\nthe lonely inhabitant.An enormous brindled cat is mewing upon the\ndoorstep, a couple of gaunt hens and a bedraggled cock are pacing the\ndeserted gardens, while from a lean-to outhouse comes the unmistakable\ngrunt of a pig.\u201cHe\u2019s not at home,\u201d he mutters.\u201cI\u2019m just as glad, for your pa would\nhave been mighty angry with me.Somewhere not far off he\u2019ll be, I\nreckon, and up to no good.Come along, Miss Ruby; we\u2019d better be\ngetting home, or the mistress\u2019ll be wondering what\u2019s come over you.\u201d\n\nThey are riding homewards by the river\u2019s bank, when they come upon a\ncurious figure.An old, old man, bent almost double under his load of\n<DW19>s, his red handkerchief tied three cornered-wise beneath his chin\nto protect his ancient head from the blazing sun.The face which looks\nout at them from beneath this strange head-gear is yellow and wizened,\nand the once keen blue eyes are dim and bleared, yet withal there is a\nsort of low cunning about the whole countenance which sends a sudden\nshiver to Ruby\u2019s heart, and prompts Dick to touch up both ponies with\nthat convenient switch of his so smartly as to cause even lethargic\nSmuttie to break into a canter.\u201cWho is he?\u201d Ruby asks in a half-frightened whisper as they slacken\npace again.She looks over her shoulder as she asks the question.The old man is standing just as they left him, gazing after them\nthrough a flood of golden light.\u201cHe\u2019s an old wicked one!\u201d he mutters.\u201cThat\u2019s him, Miss Ruby, him as we\nwere speaking about, old Davis, as stole your pa\u2019s sheep.Your pa would\nhave had him put in prison, but that he was such an old one.He\u2019s a bad\nlot though, so he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a horrid face.I don\u2019t like his face one bit,\u201d says Ruby.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Her\nown face is very white as she speaks, and her brown eyes ablaze.\u201cI\nwish we hadn\u2019t seen him,\u201d shivers the little girl, as they set their\nfaces homewards.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\u201cI kissed thee when I went away\n    On thy sweet eyes--thy lips that smiled.I heard thee lisp thy baby lore--\n    Thou wouldst not learn the word farewell.God\u2019s angels guard thee evermore,\n    Till in His heaven we meet and dwell!\u201d\n\n                               HANS ANDERSON.It is stilly night, and she is\nstanding down by the creek, watching the dance and play of the water\nover the stones on its way to the river.All around her the moonlight\nis streaming, kissing the limpid water into silver, and in the deep\nblue of the sky the stars are twinkling like gems on the robe of the\ngreat King.Not a sound can the little girl hear save the gentle murmur of the\nstream over the stones.All the world--the white, white, moon-radiant\nworld--seems to be sleeping save Ruby; she alone is awake.Stranger than all, though she is all alone, the child feels no sense of\ndread.She is content to stand there, watching the moon-kissed stream\nrushing by, her only companions those ever-watchful lights of heaven,\nthe stars.Faint music is sounding in her ears, music so faint and far away that\nit almost seems to come from the streets of the Golden City, where the\nredeemed sing the \u201cnew song\u201d of the Lamb through an endless day.Ruby\nstrains her ears to catch the notes echoing through the still night in\nfaint far-off cadence.Nearer, ever nearer, it comes; clearer, ever clearer, ring those glad\nstrains of joy, till, with a great, glorious rush they seem to flood\nthe whole world:\n\n\u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on Jack\u2019s card!\u201d Ruby cannot help exclaiming; but the words die\naway upon her lips.Gazing upwards, she sees such a blaze of glory as almost seems to blind\nher.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.Strangely enough the thought that this is only a dream, and the\nattendant necessity of pinching, do not occur to Ruby just now.She is gazing upwards in awestruck wonder to the shining sky.What is\nthis vision of fair faces, angel faces, hovering above her, faces\nshining with a light which \u201cnever was on land or sea,\u201d the radiance\nfrom their snowy wings striking athwart the gloom?And in great, glorious unison the grand old Christmas carol rings\nforth--\n\n\u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!\u201d\n\nOpen-eyed and awestruck, the little girl stands gazing upwards, a\nwonder fraught with strange beauty at her heart.Can it be possible\nthat one of those bright-faced angels may be the mother whom Ruby never\nknew, sent from the far-off land to bear the Christmas message to the\nchild who never missed a mother\u2019s love because she never knew it?\u201cOh, mamma,\u201d cries poor Ruby, stretching appealing hands up to the\nshining throng, \u201ctake me with you!Take me with you back to heaven!\u201d\n\nShe hardly knows why the words rise to her lips.Heaven has never been\na very real place to this little girl, although her mother is there;\nthe far-off city, with its pearly gates and golden streets, holds but\na shadowy place in Ruby\u2019s heart, and before to-night she has never\ngreatly desired to enter therein.The life of the present has claimed all her attention, and, amidst\nthe joys and pleasures of to-day, the coming life has held but little\nplace.But now, with heaven\u2019s glories almost opened before her, with\nthe \u201cnew song\u201d of the blessed in her ears, with her own long-lost\nmother so near, Ruby would fain be gone.Slowly the glory fades away, the angel faces grow dimmer and dimmer,\nthe heavenly music dies into silence, and the world is calm and hushed\nas before.Still Ruby stands gazing upwards, longing for the angel\nvisitants to come again.But no heavenly light illumines the sky, only\nthe pale radiance of the moon, and no sound breaks upon the child\u2019s\nlistening ear save the monotonous music of the ever-flowing water.With a disappointed little sigh, Ruby brings her gaze back to earth\nagain.The white moonlight is flooding the country for miles around,\nand in its light the ringed trees in the cleared space about the\nstation stand up gaunt and tall like watchful sentinels over this\nhome in the lonely bush.Yet Ruby has no desire to retrace her steps\nhomewards.It may be that the angel host with their wondrous song will\ncome again.So the child lingers, throwing little pebbles in the brook,\nand watching the miniature circles widen and widen, brightened to\nlimpid silver in the sheeny light.A halting footstep makes her turn her head.There, a few paces away,\na bent figure is coming wearifully along, weighted down beneath its\nbundle of <DW19>s.Near Ruby it stumbles and falls, the <DW19>s\nrolling from the wearied back down to the creek, where, caught by a\nboulder, they swing this way and that in the flowing water.Involuntarily the child gives a step forward, then springs back with\na sudden shiver.\u201cIt\u2019s the wicked old one,\u201d she whispers.\u201cAnd I\n_couldn\u2019t_ help him!Oh, I _couldn\u2019t_ help him!\u201d\n\n\u201cOn earth peace, good will toward men!\u201d Faint and far away is the echo,\nyet full of meaning to the child\u2019s heart.She gives a backward glance\nover her shoulder at the fallen old man.He is groping with his hands\nthis way and that, as though in darkness, and the blood is flowing from\na cut in the ugly yellow wizened face.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t _him_,\u201d Ruby mutters.\u201cIf it was anybody else but the\nwicked old one; but I can\u2019t be kind to _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn earth peace, good will toward men!\u201d Clearer and clearer rings out\nthe angel benison, sent from the gates of heaven, where Ruby\u2019s mother\nwaits to welcome home again the husband and child from whose loving\narms she was so soon called away.To be \u201ckind,\u201d that is what Ruby has\ndecided \u201cgood will\u201d means.Is she, then, being kind, to the old man\nwhose groping hands appeal so vainly to her aid?\u201cDad wouldn\u2019t like me to,\u201d decides Ruby, trying to stifle the voice of\nconscience.\u201cAnd he\u2019s _such_ a horrid old man.\u201d\n\nClearer and still clearer, higher and still higher rings out the\nangels\u2019 singing.There is a queer sort of tugging going on at Ruby\u2019s\nheart.She knows she ought to go back to help old Davis and yet she\ncannot--cannot!Then a great flash of light comes before her eyes, and Ruby suddenly\nwakens to find herself in her own little bed, the white curtains drawn\nclosely to ward off mosquitoes, and the morning sun slanting in and\nforming a long golden bar on the opposite curtain.The little girl rubs her eyes and stares about her.She, who has so\noften even doubted reality, finds it hard to believe that what has\npassed is really a dream.Even yet the angel voices seem to be sounding\nin her ears, the heavenly light dazzling her eyes.\u201cAnd they weren\u2019t angels, after all,\u201d murmurs Ruby in a disappointed\nvoice.\u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nOnly a dream!How many of our so-called realities are \u201conly a dream,\u201d\nfrom which we waken with disappointed hearts and saddened eyes.One far\nday there will come to us that which is not a dream, but a reality,\nwhich can never pass away, and we shall awaken in heaven\u2019s morning,\nbeing \u201csatisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d asks Ruby as they go about the station that morning, she hanging\non her father\u2019s arm, \u201cwhat was my mamma like--my own mamma, I mean?\u201d\n\nThe big man smiles, and looks down into the eager little face uplifted\nto his own.\u201cYour own mamma, little woman,\u201d he repeats gently.You remind me of her, Ruby, in a\ngreat many ways, and it is my greatest wish that you grow up just such\na woman as your dear mother was.I\ndon\u2019t think you ever asked me about your mother before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wondered,\u201d says Ruby.She is gazing up into the cloudless blue\nof the sky, which has figured so vividly in her dream of last night.\u201cI\nwish I remembered her,\u201d Ruby murmurs, with the tiniest sigh.\u201cPoor little lassie!\u201d says the father, patting the small hand.\u201cHer\ngreatest sorrow was in leaving you, Ruby.You were just a baby when she\ndied.Not long before she went away she spoke about you, her little\ngirl whom she was so unwilling to leave.\u2018Tell my little Ruby,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018that I shall be waiting for her.I have prayed to the dear Lord\nJesus that she may be one of those whom He gathers that day when He\ncomes to make up His jewels.\u2019 She used to call you her little jewel,\nRuby.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my name means a jewel,\u201d says Ruby, looking up into her father\u2019s\nface with big, wondering brown eyes.The dream mother has come nearer\nto her little girl during those last few minutes than she has ever\ndone before.Those words, spoken so long ago, have made Ruby feel her\nlong-dead young mother to be a real personality, albeit separated from\nthe little girl for whom one far day she had prayed that Christ might\nnumber her among His jewels.In that fair city, \u201cinto which no foe can\nenter, and from which no friend can ever pass away,\u201d Ruby\u2019s mother has\ndone with all care and sorrow.God Himself has wiped away all tears\nfrom her eyes for ever.Ruby goes about with a very sober little face that morning.She gathers\nfresh flowers for the sitting-room, and carries the flower-glasses\nacross the courtyard to the kitchen to wash them out.This is one of\nRuby\u2019s customary little duties.She has a variety of such small tasks\nwhich fill up the early hours of the morning.After this Ruby usually\nconscientiously learns a few lessons, which her step-mother hears her\nrecite now and then, as the humour seizes her.But at present Ruby is enjoying holidays in honour of Christmas,\nholidays which the little girl has decided shall last a month or more,\nif she can possibly manage it.\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet to-day, Ruby,\u201d observes her step-mother, as the\nchild goes about the room, placing the vases of flowers in their\naccustomed places.Thorne is reclining upon her favourite sofa,\nthe latest new book which the station affords in her hand.\u201cAren\u2019t you\nwell, child?\u201d she asks.I\u2019m all right.\u201d\n\nIt is true, as the little girl has said, that she has not even noticed\nthat she is more quiet than usual.Involuntarily her thoughts have\ngone out to the mother whom she never knew, the mother who even now is\nwaiting in sunny Paradise for the little daughter she has left behind.Since she left her so long ago, Ruby has hardly given a thought to her\nmother.The snow is lying thick on her grave in the little Scottish\nkirkyard at home; but Ruby has been happy enough without her, living\nher own glad young life without fear of death, and with no thought to\nspare for the heaven beyond.But now the radiant vision of last night\u2019s dream, combined with her\nfather\u2019s words, have set the child thinking.Will the Lord Jesus indeed\nanswer her mother\u2019s prayer, and one day gather little Ruby among His\njewels?Will he care very much that this little jewel of His has never\ntried very hard throughout her short life to work His will or do His\nbidding?What if, when the Lord Jesus comes, He finds Ruby all unworthy\nto be numbered amongst those jewels of His?And the long-lost mother,\nwho even in heaven will be the gladder that her little daughter is with\nher there, how will she bear to know that the prayer she prayed so long\nago is all in vain?\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t gather me,\u201d Ruby murmurs, staring straight up into\nthe clear, blue sky, \u201cwhat shall I do?Oh, what shall I do?\u201d\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE BUSH FIRE.\u201cWill you shew yourself gentle, and be merciful for Christ\u2019s sake\n    to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?\u201d\n\n    \u201cI will so shew myself, by God\u2019s help.\u201d\n\n                     _Consecration of Bishops, Book of Common Prayer._\n\n\nJack\u2019s card is placed upright on the mantel-piece of Ruby\u2019s bedroom,\nits back leaning against the wall, and before it stands a little girl\nwith a troubled face, and a perplexed wrinkle between her brows.\u201cIt says it there,\u201d Ruby murmurs, the perplexed wrinkle deepening.\u201cAnd\nthat text\u2019s out of the Bible.But when there\u2019s nobody to be kind to, I\ncan\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nThe sun is glinting on the frosted snow scene; but Ruby is not looking\nat the snow scene.Her eyes are following the old, old words of the\nfirst Christmas carol: \u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth\npeace, good will toward men!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there was only anybody to be kind to,\u201d the little girl repeats\nslowly.\u201cDad and mamma don\u2019t need me to be kind to them, and I _am_\nquite kind to Hans and Dick.If it was only in Scotland now; but it\u2019s\nquite different here.\u201d\n\nThe soft summer wind is swaying the window-blinds gently to and fro,\nand ruffling with its soft breath the thirsty, parched grass about the\nstation.To the child\u2019s mind has come a remembrance, a remembrance of\nwhat was \u201conly a dream,\u201d and she sees an old, old man, bowed down with\nthe weight of years, coming to her across the moonlit paths of last\nnight, an old man whom Ruby had let lie where he fell, because he was\nonly \u201cthe wicked old one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was only a dream, so it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d Thus the little girl tries\nto soothe a suddenly awakened conscience.\u201cAnd he _is_ a wicked old\none; Dick said he was.\u201d\n\nRuby goes over to the window, and stands looking out.There is no\nchange in the fair Australian scene; on just such a picture Ruby\u2019s eyes\nhave rested since first she came.But there is a strange, unexplained\nchange in the little girl\u2019s heart.Only that the dear Lord Jesus has\ncome to Ruby, asking her for His dear sake to be kind to one of the\nlowest and humblest of His creatures.\u201cIf it was only anybody else,\u201d\nshe mutters.\u201cBut he\u2019s so horrid, and he has such a horrid face.And I\ndon\u2019t see what I could do to be kind to such a nasty old man as he is.Besides, perhaps dad wouldn\u2019t like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood will toward men!Good will toward men!\u201d Again the heavenly\nvoices seem ringing in Ruby\u2019s ears.There is no angel host about her\nto strengthen and encourage her, only one very lonely little girl who\nfinds it hard to do right when the doing of that right does not quite\nfit in with her own inclinations.She has taken the first step upon the\nheavenly way, and finds already the shadow of the cross.The radiance of the sunshine is reflected in Ruby\u2019s brown eyes, the\nradiance, it may be, of something far greater in her heart.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d the little girl decides suddenly.\u201cI\u2019ll try to be kind to\nthe \u2018old one.\u2019 Only what can I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Ruby!\u201d cries an excited voice at the window, and, looking out,\nRuby sees Dick\u2019s brown face and merry eyes.\u201cCome \u2019long as quick as\nyou can.There\u2019s a fire, and you said t\u2019other day you\u2019d never seen one.I\u2019ll get Smuttie if you come as quick as you can.It\u2019s over by old\nDavis\u2019s place.\u201d\n\nDick\u2019s young mistress does not need a second bidding.She is out\nwaiting by the garden-gate long before Smuttie is caught and harnessed.Away to the west she can see the long glare of fire shooting up tongues\nof flame into the still sunlight, and brightening the river into a very\nsea of blood.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should go, Ruby,\u201d says her mother, who has come\nout on the verandah.\u201cIt isn\u2019t safe, and you are so venturesome.I am\ndreadfully anxious about your father too.Dick says he and the men are\noff to help putting out the fire; but in such weather as this I don\u2019t\nsee how they can ever possibly get it extinguished.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very, very careful, mamma,\u201d Ruby promises.Her brown eyes\nare ablaze with excitement, and her cheeks aglow.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there\nto watch dad too, you know,\u201d she adds persuasively in a voice which\nexpresses the belief that not much danger can possibly come to dad\nwhile his little girl is near.Dick has brought Smuttie round to the garden-gate, and in a moment he\nand his little mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can be\ngot to go, to the scene of the fire.Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush will never forget it.The\nfirst spark, induced sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by the\nexcessive heat of the sun\u2019s rays, gains ground with appalling rapidity,\nand where the growth is dry, large tracts of ground have often been\nlaid waste.In excessively hot weather this is more particularly the\ncase, and it is then found almost impossible to extinguish the fire.\u201cLook at it!\u201d Dick cries excitedly.\u201cGoin\u2019 like a steam-engine just.Wish we hadn\u2019t brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby.He\u2019ll maybe be frightened at\nthe fire.Do you see that other fire\non ahead?That\u2019s where they\u2019re burning down!\u201d\n\nRuby looks.Yes, there _are_ two fires, both, it seems, running, as\nDick has said, \u201clike steam-engines.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy!\u201d the boy cries suddenly; \u201cit\u2019s the old wicked one\u2019s house.It\u2019s it\nthat has got afire.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.There\u2019s not enough\nof them to do that, and to stop the fire too.And it\u2019ll be on to your\npa\u2019s land if they don\u2019t stop it pretty soon.I\u2019ll have to help them,\nMiss Ruby.You\u2019ll have to get off Smuttie and hold\nhim in case he gets scared at the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Dick!\u201d the little girl cries.Her face is very pale, and her eyes\nare fixed on that lurid light, ever growing nearer.\u201cDo you think\nhe\u2019ll be dead?Do you think the old man\u2019ll be dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot him,\u201d Dick returns, with a grin.\u201cHe\u2019s too bad to die, he is.but I wish he was dead!\u201d the boy ejaculates.\u201cIt would be a good\nriddance of bad rubbish, that\u2019s what it would.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Dick,\u201d shivers Ruby, \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t say that.I\u2019ve never been kind!\u201d Ruby\nbreaks out in a wail, which Dick does not understand.They are nearing the scene of the fire now.Luckily the cottage is\nhard by the river, so there is no scarcity of water.Stations are scarce and far between in the\nAustralian bush, and the inhabitants not easily got together.There are\ntwo detachments of men at work, one party endeavouring to extinguish\nthe flames of poor old Davis\u2019s burning cottage, the others far in\nthe distance trying to stop the progress of the fire by burning down\nthe thickets in advance, and thus starving the main fire as it gains\nground.This method of \u201cstarving the fire\u201d is well known to dwellers in\nthe Australian bush, though at times the second fire thus given birth\nto assumes such proportions as to outrun its predecessor.\u201cI don\u2019t like leaving\nyou, Miss Ruby; but I\u2019ll have to do it.Even a boy\u2019s a bit of help in\nbringing the water.You don\u2019t mind, do you, Miss Ruby?I think, if I\nwas you, now that you\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019d turn and go home again.Smuttie\u2019s\neasy enough managed; but if he got frightened, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d\ndo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get down and hold him,\u201d Ruby says.\u201cI want to watch.\u201d Her heart\nis sick within her.She has never seen a fire before, and it seems so\nfraught with danger that she trembles when she thinks of dad, the being\nshe loves best on earth.\u201cGo you away to the fire, Dick,\u201d adds Ruby,\nvery pale, but very determined.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of being left alone.\u201d\n\nThe fire is gaining ground every moment, and poor old Davis\u2019s desolate\nhome bids fair to be soon nothing but a heap of blackened ruins.Dick gives one look at the burning house, and another at his little\nmistress.There is no time to waste if he is to be of any use.\u201cI don\u2019t like leaving you, Miss Ruby,\u201d says Dick again; but he goes all\nthe same.Ruby, left alone, stands by Smuttie\u2019s head, consoling that faithful\nlittle animal now and then with a pat of the hand.It is hot,\nscorchingly hot; but such cold dread sits at the little girl\u2019s heart\nthat she does not even feel the heat.In her ears is the hissing of\nthose fierce flames, and her love for dad has grown to be a very agony\nin the thought that something may befall him.\u201cRuby!\u201d says a well-known voice, and through the blaze of sunlight she\nsees her father coming towards her.His face, like Ruby\u2019s, is very\npale, and his hands are blackened with the grime and soot.\u201cYou ought\nnot to be here, child.Away home to your mother,\nand tell her it is all right, for I know she will be feeling anxious.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut is it all right, dad?\u201d the little girl questions anxiously.Her\neyes flit from dad\u2019s face to the burning cottage, and then to those\nother figures in the lurid light far away.\u201cAnd mamma _will_ be\nfrightened; for she\u2019ll think you\u2019ll be getting hurt.And so will I,\u201d\nadds poor Ruby with a little catch in her voice.\u201cWhat nonsense, little girl,\u201d says her father cheerfully.\u201cThere,\ndear, I have no time to wait, so get on Smuttie, and let me see you\naway.That\u2019s a brave little girl,\u201d he adds, stooping to kiss the small\nanxious face.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.It is with a sore, sore heart that Ruby rides home lonely by the\nriver\u2019s side.She has not waited for her trouble to come to her, but\nhas met it half way, as more people than little brown-eyed Ruby are too\nfond of doing.Dad is the very dearest thing Ruby has in the whole wide\nworld, and if anything happens to dad, whatever will she do?\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear it,\u201d murmurs poor Ruby, wiping away a very big\ntear which has fallen on Smuttie\u2019s broad back.Ah, little girl with the big, tearful, brown eyes, you have still to\nlearn that any trouble can be borne patiently, and with a brave face to\nthe world, if only God gives His help![Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\u201cI CAN NEVER DO

far\naway the flames, like so many forked and lurid tongues of fire, leaping\nup into the still air and looking strangely out of place against\nthe hazy blue of the summer sky.The little girl leaves her almost\nuntouched dinner, and steals out to the verandah, where she sits, a\nforlorn-looking little figure, in the glare of the afternoon sunshine,\nwith her knees drawn up to her chin, and her brown eyes following\neagerly the pathway by the river where she has ridden with Dick no\nlater than this morning.This morning!--to waiting Ruby it seems more\nlike a century ago.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.Jenny finds her there when she has washed up the dinner dishes, tidied\nall for the afternoon, and come out to get what she expresses as a\n\u201cbreath o\u2019 caller air,\u201d after her exertions of the day.The \u201cbreath\no\u2019 air\u201d Jenny may get; but it will never be \u201ccaller\u201d nor anything\napproaching \u201ccaller\u201d at this season of the year.Poor Jenny, she may\nwell sigh for the fresh moorland breezes of bonnie Scotland with its\nshady glens, where the bracken and wild hyacinth grow, and where the\nvery plash of the mountain torrent or \u201csough\u201d of the wind among the\ntrees, makes one feel cool, however hot and sultry it may be.\u201cYe\u2019re no cryin\u2019, Miss Ruby?\u201d ejaculates Jenny.\u201cNo but that the heat\no\u2019 this outlandish place would gar anybody cry.What\u2019s wrong wi\u2019 ye, ma\nlambie?\u201d Jenny can be very gentle upon occasion.\u201cAre ye no weel?\u201d For\nall her six years of residence in the bush, Jenny\u2019s Scotch tongue is\nstill aggressively Scotch.Ruby raises a face in which tears and smiles struggle hard for mastery.\u201cI\u2019m not crying, _really_, Jenny,\u201d she answers.\u201cOnly,\u201d with a\nsuspicious droop of the dark-fringed eye-lids and at the corners of the\nrosy mouth, \u201cI was pretty near it.I can\u2019t help watching the flames, and thinking that something might\nperhaps be happening to him, and me not there to know.And then I began\nto feel glad to think how nice it would be to see him and Dick come\nriding home.Jenny, how _do_ little girls get along who have no\nfather?\u201d\n\nIt is strange that Ruby never reflects that her own mother has gone\nfrom her.\u201cThe Lord A\u2019mighty tak\u2019s care o\u2019 such,\u201d Jenny responds solemnly.\u201cYe\u2019ll just weary your eyes glowerin\u2019 awa\u2019 at the fire like that, Miss\nRuby.They say that \u2018a watched pot never boils,\u2019 an\u2019 I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 your\npapa\u2019ll no come a meenit suner for a\u2019 your watchin\u2019.Gae in an\u2019 rest\nyersel\u2019 like the mistress.She\u2019s sleepin\u2019 finely on the sofa.\u201d\n\nRuby gives a little impatient wriggle.\u201cHow can I, Jenny,\u201d she exclaims\npiteously, \u201cwhen dad\u2019s out there?I don\u2019t know whatever I would do\nif anything was to happen to dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cPit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,\u201d the Scotchwoman says\nreverently.\u201cYe\u2019ll be in richt gude keepin\u2019 then, an\u2019 them ye love as\nweel.\u201d\n\nBut Ruby only wriggles again.Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and whose little\ndaughter\u2019s heart would surely break if aught of ill befell him.So the long, long afternoon wears away, and when is an afternoon so\ntedious as when one is eagerly waiting for something or some one?Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear the clatter of plates and\ncups echoing across the quadrangle as she makes ready the early tea.The child\u2019s eyes are dim with the glare at which she has so long been\ngazing, and her limbs, in their cramped position, are aching; but Ruby\nhardly seems to feel the discomfort from which those useful members\nsuffer.She goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother\u2019s\nfretful little complaints with an absent air which shows how far away\nher heart is, and returns as soon as she may to her point of vantage.\u201cOh, me!\u201d sighs the poor little girl.\u201cWill he never come?\u201d\n\nOut in the west the red sun is dying grandly in an amber sky, tinged\nwith the glory of his life-blood, when dad at length comes riding home.Ruby has seen him far in the distance, and runs out past the gate to\nmeet him.Oh,\ndad, are you hurt?\u201d her quick eyes catching sight of his hand in a\nsling.\u201cOnly a scratch, little girl,\u201d he says.\u201cDon\u2019t\nfrighten the mother about it.Poor little Ruby red, were you\nfrightened?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk.Did you think your old father was to be killed outright?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Ruby says.Oh, dad, wasn\u2019t it\njust dreadful--the fire, I mean?\u201d\n\nBlack Prince has been put into the paddock, and Ruby goes into the\nhouse, hanging on her father\u2019s uninjured arm.The child\u2019s heart has\ngrown suddenly light.The terrible fear which has been weighing her\ndown for the last few hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old joyous\nself again.\u201cDad,\u201d the little girl says later on.They are sitting

gathers round them, and the stars twinkle\nout one by one.But, far away in the heaven which is beyond the stars\nand the dim twilight of this world, I think that God knows how one\nlittle girl, whose eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be \u201ckind,\u201d\nand it may be that in His own good time--and God\u2019s time is always the\nbest--He will let old Davis \u201cknow\u201d also.\u201cThere came a glorious morning, such a one\n  As dawns but once a season.Mercury\n  On such a morning would have flung himself\n  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings\n  To some tall mountain: when I said to her,\n  \u2018A day for gods to stoop,\u2019 she answered \u2018Ay,\n  And men to soar.\u2019\u201d\n\n                                          TENNYSON.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.Ruby goes about her work and play very gravely for the next few days.A great sorrow sits at her heart which only time can lighten and chase\naway.She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing\nit, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother\nRuby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small\ntroubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl\u2019s _confidant_; but, then,\ndad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne\u2019s presence Ruby never thinks of\nconfiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is\nriding by her father\u2019s side along the river\u2019s bank, Black Prince doing\nhis very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie\u2019s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue\nhaze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.But Ruby and dad are early\nastir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful\nyoung freshness of a glorious summer morning.\u201cIt\u2019s lovely just now,\u201d Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.\u201cI wish it would always stay early morning; don\u2019t you, dad?It\u2019s like\nwhere it says in the hymn about \u2018the summer morn I\u2019ve sighed for.\u2019\nP\u2019raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it\nwill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,\u201d says dad, a\nsudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child\u2019s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of\nmemory to another summer\u2019s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by\nthe bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched\nRuby\u2019s mother go home to God.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you, Will,\u201d she had\nwhispered only a little while before she went away.\u201cIt won\u2019t be so\nvery long, my darling; for even heaven won\u2019t be quite heaven to me with\nyou away.\u201d And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the\nbirds\u2019 soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the\nangels had come for Ruby\u2019s mother, and the dawning for her had been the\nglorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for\nthe desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her\nmother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests\nhave come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old\ndays of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never\nwill; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused\nhim to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called\naway in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby\u2019s words have come to him\nthis summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his\nthoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God\u2019s land on\nhigh, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting\nlongingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly\ndisappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life\nitself will not one day join her there.\u201cDad,\u201d Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that\nother dear one above her, \u201cwhat is the matter?You looked so sorry, so\nvery sorry, just now,\u201d adds the little girl, with something almost like\na sob.Did I?\u201d says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends\ndown to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,\nbrown hair.\u201cI was thinking of your mother, Ruby,\u201d dad says.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.\u201cBut\ninstead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all\ntears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was\nthinking of her at heaven\u2019s gate, darling, watching, as she said she\nwould, for you and for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, \u201chow will I\nknow her?God will have to tell her,\nwon\u2019t He?And p\u2019raps I\u2019ll be quite grown up \u2019fore I die, and mother\nwon\u2019t think it\u2019s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,\u201d adds the\nchild, in a puzzled voice.\u201cGod will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,\u201d says the\nfather, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all\ntrue Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is\nholy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has\nnever even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had\nno time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which\nto Ruby, in more senses than one, is \u201cvery far off.\u201d\n\nFar in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out\nand in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,\ntheir green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above\nall stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy\ncloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God\u2019s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby\u2019s eyes have gazed on often,\nwith but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her\nthoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where\nthe shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness\nof the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little\ngirl\u2019s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the \u201cbeautiful, beautiful\nriver\u201d by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one\nday cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid\ndown.On what beauties must not her mother\u2019s eyes be now gazing!But\neven midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,\nloving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with\nher there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange\nquietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of\nthe day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose\nduty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the\nnearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,\naddressed in very big letters to \u201cMiss Ruby Thorne.\u201d With fingers\ntrembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long\nwhite box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever\neven imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when\nset upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the\ndaintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her\nfeet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, \u201ca love of a\ndoll,\u201d and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the\nbriny ocean.\u201cIt\u2019s from Jack!\u201d cries Ruby, her eyes shining.\u201cOh, and here\u2019s a\nletter pinned to dolly\u2019s dress!What a nice writer he is!\u201d The child\u2019s\ncheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the\nenvelope open.\u201cI\u2019ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I\u2019ll give\nit to you.\u201d\n\n    \u201cMY DEAR LITTLE RUBY\u201d (so the letter runs),\n\n    \u201cI have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do\n    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of\n    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper\n    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend\n    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten\n    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy\n    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy\n    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you\n    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have\n    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother\u2019s home,\n    isn\u2019t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend\n    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you\n    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,\n    and, looking forward to next Christmas,\n\n                          \u201cI remain, my dear little Ruby red,\n                                                \u201cYour old friend,\n                                                             \u201cJACK.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl\u2019s account,\u201d\nremarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am\nsure he would like to have a letter from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just love him,\u201d says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.\u201cI wish\nI could call the doll after him; but then, \u2018Jack\u2019 would never do for\na lady\u2019s name.I know what I\u2019ll do!\u201d with a little dance of delight.\u201cI\u2019ll call her \u2018May\u2019 after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and\nI\u2019ll call her \u2018Kirke\u2019 for her second name, and that\u2019ll be after Jack.I\u2019ll tell him that when I write, and I\u2019d better send him back his card\ntoo.\u201d\n\nThat very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to\nher friend.\u201cMY DEAR JACK\u201d (writes Ruby in her large round hand),\n\n[\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say,\u201d murmurs the little girl, pausing with\nher pen uplifted.\u201cI never wrote a letter before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank him for the doll, of course,\u201d advises Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.Thorne, with an\namused smile.\u201cThat is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.\u201d\n\nSo Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]\n\n    \u201cThank you very much for the doll.I am calling her \u2018May Kirke,\u2019 after the name on your card, and\n    after your own name; because I couldn\u2019t call her \u2018Jack.\u2019 We are\n    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans\u2019\n    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am\n    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to\n    you.It won\u2019t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you\n    back your card.\u201cWith love, from your little friend,\n                                                               \u201cRUBY.\u201cP.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I\n    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly\n    spelt.\u201d\n\nJack Kirke\u2019s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,\nand it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two\nwords, \u201cMay Kirke,\u201d appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they\nare written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be\nin love.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\u201cThe Christmas bells from hill to hill\n  Answer each other in the mist.\u201d\n\n                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a\nChristmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little\nbrown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state\nof excitement.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy\ncheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to\nperfection.\u201cCan\u2019t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d the child returns.\u201cAnd neither could you, Aunt Lena,\nif you knew my dear Jack.What if he\u2019s just gone on straight home to Greenock without\nstopping here at all.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!\u201d cries Ruby,\nsuddenly growing very grave.Just about as probable, you wild\nlittle Australian,\u201d laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears\nsufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them\nto be sisters.\u201cYou must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,\nRuby.But of course you can\u2019t be expected to know that, living in the\nAustralian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever\nsurvived it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma was very often ill,\u201d Ruby returns very gravely.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.\u201cShe didn\u2019t\nlike being out there at all, compared with Scotland.\u2018Bonnie Scotland\u2019\nJenny always used to call it.But I do think,\u201d adds the child, with\na small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,\n\u201cthat Glengarry\u2019s bonnier.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.There are so many houses here, and you can\u2019t\nsee the river unless you go away up above them all.P\u2019raps though in\nsummer,\u201d with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something\nnot just quite polite.\u201cAnd then when grandma and you are always used\nto it.It\u2019s different with me; I\u2019ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,\u201d cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the\nfront door, \u201chere he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!\u201d Aunt Lena can hear\nthe shrill childish voice exclaiming.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.I thought p\u2019raps there had been a collision.\u201d And presently\nthe dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of\nexcitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton\u2019s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of\ndisappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.The \u201cJack\u201d Ruby\nhad talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the\nlady\u2019s mind\u2019s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort\nof man likely to take a child\u2019s fancy; ay, and a woman\u2019s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one\nwould not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton\nas her hand is taken in the young Scotchman\u2019s strong grasp.His face,\nnow that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly\npale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly\nfascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when\nJack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling\nsuitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken \u201cno,\u201d ceases to wonder how\neven the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of\nthis plain-faced man.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.\u201cI am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,\u201d Jack Kirke\nsays.\u201cIt is good of you to receive me for Ruby\u2019s sake.\u201d He glances\ndown at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes\ntighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.\u201cI\u2019ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,\u201d Ruby proclaims in her shrill\nsweet voice.\u201cShe said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had\nsaid.Jack, can\u2019t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if\nyou could.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat\nyour Christmas dinner with us, Mr.\u201cIn\nsuch weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey\nto Greenock for a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,\u201d the young man\nresponds.\u201cI should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock\nthis afternoon at my mother\u2019s.She is foolish enough to set great store\nby her unworthy son, and I couldn\u2019t let her have the dismal cheer\nof eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,\u201d the young\nfellow\u2019s voice softens as he speaks, \u201cthere were two of us.Nowadays\nI must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He\nwas my only brother\u201d--all the agony of loss contained in that \u201cwas\u201d no\none but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--\u201cand it is little more than\na year now since he died.My poor mother, I don\u2019t know how I had the\nheart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was\nnearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to\nher this year, if I possibly can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas Wat like you?\u201d Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her\nlong-lost friend\u2019s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to\nbe ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.\u201cI wish\nI\u2019d known him too,\u201d Ruby says.\u201cA thousand times better,\u201d Wat\u2019s brother returns with decision.\u201cHe was\nthe kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to\nbe praising up one\u2019s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would\nhave been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow\nas him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a\npoor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This\nis his photograph,\u201d rummaging his pocket-book--\u201cno, not that one, old\nlady,\u201d a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.\u201cMayn\u2019t I see it, Jack?\u201d she\npetitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is\nimpossible to refuse the child\u2019s request.Had Ruby\u2019s aunt not been\npresent, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice face.\u201d\n\nIt is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in\ngood number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many\nyears.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good\npictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir\nWilliam had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much\nexpense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat\nat Easton, near Towcester.[75]\n\n    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the\n    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow\n    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a\nletter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit\nLord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all\nthe buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,\nbeginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had\nbeen pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),\nand consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both\nKing Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident\nhappened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an\nuniversal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting\nof plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and\ninsects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,\nand one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of\ngrasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This\ncollection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural\ndiscourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,\nsufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged\nhim.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British\n    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath\nand Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the\noaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from\nChichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now\ncome to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]\nyet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,\nespecially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or\ndivine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;\nthat Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his\nadvice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he\nbelieved he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says\nthe Archbishop, when they come to ask, say \"_Nolo_,\" and say it from the\nheart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be\ndone in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I\nknow not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved\nin his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead\ntheir interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty\nin their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as\nwise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have\nproceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against\ntheir consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said\nthat he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house\naltogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and\nhis son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was\nperformed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the\nafternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the\nchief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard\nOnslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's\nGuard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of\nCherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the\nvault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great\nconcourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the\nTower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the\nnew Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not\nacknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent\nman.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the\nSheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep\npossession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was\ndispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the\nfew Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a\ngreat party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though\nthose who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as\nformerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people\nnever refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not\nheretics.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty\nof passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave\nno little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,\nthere was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure\nof that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the\nTower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's\npermission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of\n    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of\n    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first\nsermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to\nwhich I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and\nlecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by\nKing James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious\nman near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the\nDoctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he\nwas not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should\nbe made a

had been Treasurer of the Navy, and\nadvancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I\nthink the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my\ncousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to\nlet our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the\nsame infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in\nmy brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned\nyoung man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a\nvery religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of\nParliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put\nunder the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the\nbank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty\ngenerally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with\nbombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive\nwar was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling\non the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy\nend of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many\nexecuted at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable\nextent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the\nnominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,\nwhere I found a family of ten children, five sons and five\ndaughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All\npainted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,\nand seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the\nchildren of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished\nas to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,\nin that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing\ncolumns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece\nof architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like\ndrawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the\nbuilding beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star\nfrom a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be\nbuilt by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of\nthose at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the\nState.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come\non the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had\na paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was\nput out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers\nconsiderable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a\nFrench refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the\nReformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much\ndiscourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning\nthe _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a\ntime when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure\nhim (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an\napothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion\nof it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very\nhonest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only\nthing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his\nphysicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being\nasked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it\nwould spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last\nconfessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that\nthe late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office\nfor the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which\nI thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,\npiety, and prudence.He being my\nproxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very\nmortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.13th January, 1694-95.The deaths by\nsmallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The\nKing and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court\nat Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was\ndesired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to\nmaintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five\nweeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,\nand our neighbor, Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George\nEvelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the\nLords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital\ndesigned to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a\ndesign to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street\nleading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the\nQueen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a\nmourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred\npoor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded\nand covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,\naldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,\nwho related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,\nwhich was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,\nwho were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was\nfound wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any\nextraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This\npaper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent\nthings under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were\nvery small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in\nany private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for\ntaking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo\nthe renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought\nat the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was", "question": "Where is the apple?

Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by\nsome of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great\nclamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,\nshowing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first\nmeeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at\nGreenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of\nShrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners\nof the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and\nseveral more.Lowndes, Secretary to the\nLords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee\nappointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir\nChristopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and\nmyself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how\nthe standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and\nwhat ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper\nordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the\ncommission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done\nthat day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were\nscruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being\nnamed as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,\nthough the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a\nquorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or\nL8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the\nArchbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers\nin the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,\nand garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual\nArchbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished\nby his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,\nparticularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing\ndone.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of\nall the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for\nmarriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading\nthe names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]\n\n19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady\nis aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went\nthence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,\nparson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not\nalways seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set\nharvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much\ncontroversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a\ncruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The\nseason wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and\nworthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to\nlive decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the\nEast Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French\nmen-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,\nto my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and\nindustrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been\nimmense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same\nnear our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than\nspending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,\nwithout any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,\nought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or\nChristianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my\nson Draper, died suddenly.His lady being\nown aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no\nheir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich\nhospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,\nbut I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very\nsharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the\nnorth, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was\neverywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he\nexpected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the\ntheater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some\nancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and\nlearned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was\nencouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to\nvisit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying\nsight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;\nalso his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other\npretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had\nerected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an\ninscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most\nperfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books\nsix feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He\nplays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at\nWhitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,\nfor matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent\nconversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King\nbeing returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord\nSunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These\nfireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest\nhimself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the\nbooks want place.Williams continued in Boyle's\nlectures another year.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite\nand underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being\nobnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform\nthe coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of\nhalf-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.12th January, 1695-96.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the\nclipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to\ncold.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.The \"Royal Sovereign\" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built\nin 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps\nthe cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in\nDorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for\na large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of\nthat material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty\nknights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,\nand Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the\nfirst opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or\nto the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to\nCalais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army\nin readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection\nhere, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,\nKing James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered\nby some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could\napprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,\nwere taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,\ncongratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,\nif King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on\nthe <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing\nup to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown\nshould be disposed of according to the late settlement at the\nRevolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from\nLondon.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general\nanimosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the\nnation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and\nall things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by\nthe enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness\nof the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had\nvery few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral\nRooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,\nwith others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,\nand were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could\nbe got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look\non it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of\nGod.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design\nof assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his\nfriends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King\nWilliam.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so\nmany of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding\ntheir design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and\nDunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they\nwere so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their\nmasts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to\nhave invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,\nwhereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate\nthe King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of\ninciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and\nsome very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]\n\n6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John\nFriend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at\nTemple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was\nsuch at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles\nII., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]\n\n    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into\n    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who\nabsolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the apple.One of them (Snatt)\nwas a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to\nthe canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee\nabout settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years\na more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the\nKing's House at Kensington.The\ngallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of\nTitian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,\nTintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty\nprivate library.His prayer before\nthe sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with\nfifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous\ntrain of gallants.Oates\ndedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he\npresumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,\nspeaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own\nfather.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,\nthe Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult\nabout settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity;

yet I returned to Deptford at\nnight.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from\nIreland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that\nnone was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying\nfor common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all\nlawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged\nto renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King\nWilliam's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all\nthe Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's\nBench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the\noath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the\nParliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and\nothers surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,\nwere now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to\nworkmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]\n\n1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to\nletting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition\nto keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,\nat Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the\nfirst agreement with divers workmen and for materials;

Angelo of a man gathering\nfruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the\nold masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great\nsubscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current\nmoney to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in\nthe markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums\ndaily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure\nsent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and\nnow only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day\nfeared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late\nParliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they\nhad provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and\ngoldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their\ntreasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since\na mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of\nBuckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as\nmuch in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague\nfor an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein\non several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath\nwas cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those\ningenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some\nthings very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet\nthe city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck\nTemple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up\nto take place of several wills.The\ncause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I\nstayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,\nbeing persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for\nGreenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid\nthe first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in\nthe evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's\nAstronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the\nsubscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual\nand impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect\nwinter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,\nof which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,\nnobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in\nFlanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the\ntreasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14\nor 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the\nArchbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.David's, who was suspended for simony.The\nArchbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how\nexceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a\ncold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter\nof Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows;

but a white, white Christmas this time--a\nChristmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little\nbrown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state\nof excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy\ncheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to\nperfection.\u201cCan\u2019t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d the child returns.\u201cAnd neither could you, Aunt Lena,\nif you knew my dear Jack.What if he\u2019s just gone on straight home to Greenock without\nstopping here at all.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!\u201d cries Ruby,\nsuddenly growing very grave.Just about as probable, you wild\nlittle Australian,\u201d laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears\nsufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them\nto be sisters.\u201cYou must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,\nRuby.But of course you can\u2019t be expected to know that, living in the\nAustralian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever\nsurvived it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma was very often ill,\u201d Ruby returns very gravely.\u201cShe didn\u2019t\nlike being out there at all, compared with Scotland.\u2018Bonnie Scotland\u2019\nJenny always used to call it.But I do think,\u201d adds the child, with\na small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,\n\u201cthat Glengarry\u2019s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can\u2019t\nsee the river unless you go away up above them all.P\u2019raps though in\nsummer,\u201d with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something\nnot just quite polite.\u201cAnd then when grandma and you are always used\nto it.It\u2019s different with me; I\u2019ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,\u201d cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the\nfront door, \u201chere he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!\u201d Aunt Lena can hear\nthe shrill childish voice exclaiming.I thought p\u2019raps there had been a collision.\u201d And presently\nthe dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of\nexcitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton\u2019s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of\ndisappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The \u201cJack\u201d Ruby\nhad talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the\nlady\u2019s mind\u2019s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort\nof man likely to take a child\u2019s fancy; ay, and a woman\u2019s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one\nwould not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton\nas her hand is taken in the young Scotchman\u2019s strong grasp.His face,\nnow that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly\npale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly\nfascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when\nJack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling\nsuitor from her feet with", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "\u201cI am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,\u201d Jack Kirke\nsays.\u201cIt is good of you to receive me for Ruby\u2019s sake.\u201d He glances\ndown at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes\ntighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.\u201cI\u2019ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,\u201d Ruby proclaims in her shrill\nsweet voice.\u201cShe said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had\nsaid.Jack, can\u2019t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if\nyou could.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat\nyour Christmas dinner with us, Mr.\u201cIn\nsuch weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey\nto Greenock for a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,\u201d the young man\nresponds.\u201cI should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock\nthis afternoon at my mother\u2019s.She is foolish enough to set great store\nby her unworthy son, and I couldn\u2019t let her have the dismal cheer\nof eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,\u201d the young\nfellow\u2019s voice softens as he speaks, \u201cthere were two of us.Nowadays\nI must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He\nwas my only brother\u201d--all the agony of loss contained in that \u201cwas\u201d no\none but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--\u201cand it is little more than\na year now since he died.My poor mother, I don\u2019t know how I had the\nheart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was\nnearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to\nher this year, if I possibly can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas Wat like you?\u201d Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her\nlong-lost friend\u2019s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to\nbe ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.\u201cI wish\nI\u2019d known him too,\u201d Ruby says.\u201cA thousand times better,\u201d Wat\u2019s brother returns with decision.\u201cHe was\nthe kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to\nbe praising up one\u2019s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would\nhave been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow\nas him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a\npoor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This\nis his photograph,\u201d rummaging his pocket-book--\u201cno, not that one, old\nlady,\u201d a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.\u201cMayn\u2019t I see it, Jack?\u201d she\npetitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is\nimpossible to refuse the child\u2019s request.Had Ruby\u2019s aunt not been\npresent, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice face.\u201d\n\nIt is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The\nface of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though\nperhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells\nhow to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,\nfor lack of a better name, the world terms \u201cImagination.\u201d For those\nwho possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a\nsoftly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,\na reflection of God\u2019s radiance upon the very meanest things of this\nearth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy\nkeener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully\ncomprehend and understand.\u201cAnd this is Wat,\u201d goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the\nquestion which he sees hovering on Ruby\u2019s lips.\u201cI like him, too,\u201d Ruby cries, with shining eyes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.\u201cLook, Aunt Lena,\nisn\u2019t he nice?Doesn\u2019t he look nice and kind?\u201d\n\nThere is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the\npictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed\nhave been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness\nrests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for\never from the eyes of Jack\u2019s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has\nawakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?\u201d says Ruby\u2019s mother, fluttering into the\nroom.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid\ninvalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life\nhave done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more\nlike pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since\nher marriage.We have been out calling on a few\nfriends, and got detained.I hope\nthat you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are\nhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat\nmy Christmas dinner in Greenock,\u201d Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.\u201cBusiness took me north, or I shouldn\u2019t have been away from home in\nsuch weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my\njourney in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting\non.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that\nif you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than\npleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,\nthat she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,\nand discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son\u2019s\nheart so completely by storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and, Jack,\u201d cries Ruby, \u201cI\u2019ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,\nseeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can\u2019t\nI bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called\nafter you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn\u2019t\nshe?\u201d questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May\u2019s donor with very\nwide brown eyes.\u201cIt would never do to leave May\nbehind in Edinburgh.\u201d He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but\nRuby does not notice that then.\u201cDad,\u201d Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, \u201cdo you know what?We\u2019re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away\nfrom us, Ruby,\u201d observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.Kirke, you seem to have\nstolen one young lady\u2019s heart at least away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack\u2019s hair in rather a babyish\nway she has.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I\nlike Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because\nJack\u2019s here.\u201d\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\u201cAs the stars for ever and ever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJack,\u201d Ruby says very soberly, \u201cI want you to do something for me.\u201d\n\nCrowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke\u2019s expected letter,\nbacked by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend\nthe first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby\u2019s parents have\ndeparted to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little\ngirl, at Mrs.Kirke\u2019s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.\u201cFor Jack\u2019s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,\u201d Jack\u2019s\nmother had said.\u201cIt makes everything so bright to have a child\u2019s\npresence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter\ndied.\u201d\n\nSad enough!Few but Jack could have told\nhow sad.\u201cFire away, little Ruby red,\u201d is Jack\u2019s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby\ncurled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with\nhis eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to\nthe roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.\u201cYou know the day we went down to\nInverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma\u2019s grave--my own mamma,\nI mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought\nI should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so\nlonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried\nthere.And she was my own mamma,\u201d adds the little girl, a world of\npathos in her young voice.\u201cSo there\u2019s nobody but me to do it.So,\nJack, would you mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking you?\u201d exclaims the young man.It\u2019ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not\nexactly jolly,\u201d remembering the intent of their journey, \u201cbut very\nnice.Luckily the yard\u2019s having holidays just\nnow, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don\u2019t you bother about\nthem.I\u2019ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you are good!\u201d cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms\nround the young man\u2019s neck.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t so old, Jack, and I\u2019d\nmarry you when I grew up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m desperately old,\u201d says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,\nwhite teeth in a smile.I shall be quite an\nold fogey when you\u2019re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the\nsame for the honour,\u201d says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to\nhimself a little.\u201cBut you\u2019ll find some nice young squatter in the days\nto come who\u2019ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,\u201d decides Ruby,\nresolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this\nasseveration to her.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get married.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.I\nwouldn\u2019t like to leave dad.\u201d\n\nThe following day sees a young man and a child passing through the\nquaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the\nbusy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which\nencircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully\nlonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw\nhave come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in\ndiscoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.\u201cI know it by the tombstone,\u201d observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close\nthe gates behind them.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.\u201cIt\u2019s a grey tombstone, and mamma\u2019s name below\na lot of others.This is it, I think,\u201d adds the child, pausing before\na rather desolate-looking grey slab.\u201cYes, there\u2019s her name at the\nfoot, \u2018Janet Stuart,\u2019 and dad says that was her favourite text that\u2019s\nunderneath--\u2018Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.\u2019\nI\u2019ll put down the flowers.I wonder,\u201d says Ruby, looking up into Jack\u2019s\nface with a sudden glad wonder on her own, \u201cif mamma can look down from\nheaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody\u2019s putting\nflowers on her grave at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,\u201d\nJack Kirke says very gently.\u201cBut she will be glad, I am sure, if she\nsees us--and I think she does,\u201d the young man adds reverently--\u201cthat\nthrough all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember her,\u201d says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.\u201cOnly dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me\nthat she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord\nJesus that I might be one of His jewels.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.I\u2019m not!\u201d cries\nRuby, with a little choke in her voice.\u201cAnd if I\u2019m not, the Lord Jesus\nwill never gather me, and I\u2019ll never see my mamma again.Even up in\nheaven she might p\u2019raps feel sorry if some day I wasn\u2019t there too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jack says quickly.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.He puts his arm about the little girl\u2019s\nshoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who\nis wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed\nway, wondered too, if even \u2019midst heaven\u2019s glories another will \u201cfeel\nsorry\u201d because those left behind will not one far day join them there.\u201cI felt that too,\u201d the young man goes on quietly.\u201cBut it\u2019s all right\nnow, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,\nand I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be\nwas no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the\nmists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very\nbest possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn\u2019t understand\njust yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite\nsure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn\u2019t rest till\nI made sure of that.It\u2019s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the\ndear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I\nwondered how I could have doubted so long.I can\u2019t speak about such\nthings,\u201d the young fellow adds huskily, \u201cbut I felt that if you feel\nabout your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don\u2019t you\nsee, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able\nto save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat\u2019s sake that I tried to\nlove Him first; but now I love Him for His own.\u201d\n\nIt has cost Ruby\u2019s friend more than the child knows to make even this\nsimple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven\u2019s morning\nJack\u2019s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a\ndoubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter\u2019s day.For it is\nsaid that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for\nthe dear Christ\u2019s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.\u201cI love you, Jack,\u201d is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend\u2019s\nhand.\u201cAnd if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I\u2019ll tell her how\ngood you\u2019ve been to me.Jack, won\u2019t it be nice if we\u2019re all there\ntogether, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?\u201d\n\nJack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow\u2019s heart has\ngone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the\nbrother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart\nfeels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother\nJack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;\nthat too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and\nnow!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into\nthe sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all\ntrouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad\u2019s heart cries out with a fierce\nyearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear\nold Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm\nhand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the\nsong of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but\nsweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which\nJack Kirke has known since he was a child.\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little\nface uplifted to his, \u201cit _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we\nwon\u2019t disappoint them, mustn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nAnother face than Ruby\u2019s uprises before the young man\u2019s eyes as he\nspeaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference\nto Jack\u2019s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God\nthan he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had\nlooked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days\nwhen the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things\nof the wonderful \u201cmay be\u201d to come.But now God has raised Wat higher\nthan even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and\nbrought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.No, Jack\ndetermines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless\ntree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,\nsave for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field\nas it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack\u2019s is Ruby\u2019s\nlittle hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and\nRuby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby\u2019s mother need fear\ndisappointment now.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.\u201cI\u2019m glad I came,\u201d says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train\ngoes whizzing home.\u201cThere was nobody to come but me, you see, me and\ndad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.They\nwere all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says\nthat he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,\u201d Jack says with one of\nhis bright, kindly smiles.\u201cIt\u2019s the best sight in the world to see a\nbrave woman; at least _I_ think so,\u201d adds the young man, smiling down\ninto the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in\nwhich he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old\ndays at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,\nwho had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as\na child-avoider.Is it Wat\u2019s mantle\ndropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother\u2019s kindly\nheart, which has softened the younger\u2019s, and made him \u201ckind,\u201d as Ruby\none long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact\nwith?<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.For Wat\u2019s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it\nis for a greater than that dear brother\u2019s, even for Christ\u2019s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of\nhis great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed\nhim in the pilgrimage.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.\u201cJack,\u201d Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try--you know.I don\u2019t want to disappoint mamma.\u201d\n\nUp in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the\nless true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone\nhome to God: \u201cAnd they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of\nthe firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars\nfor ever and ever.\u201d\n\nSurely, in the dawning of that \u201csummer morn\u201d Jack\u2019s crown will not be a\nstarless one.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nMAY.\u201cFor God above\n    Is great to grant,

drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of\nthe photograph in Jack\u2019s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.\u201cThis is our little Australian, May,\u201d the elder lady says, stretching\nout her hand to Ruby.\u201cRuby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack\nmay have told you about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you do, dear?\u201d Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear\nvoice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,\nRuby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich\ntips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,\nand her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little\ngirl.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.\u201cI\u2019ve seen your photograph,\u201d Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet\nface above her.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.\u201cIt fell out of Jack\u2019s pocket-book one day.I\u2019m going to give him mine to carry there too; for\nJack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.\u201d\n\nMiss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red\nas her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help\nthinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke\nsmiles in rather an embarrassed way.\u201cHave you been long in Scotland, Ruby?\u201d the young lady questions, as\nthough desirous of changing the subject.\u201cWe came about the beginning of December,\u201d Ruby returns.And then she\ntoo puts rather an irrelevant question: \u201cAre you May?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, I suppose I am May,\u201d Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite\nof herself.\u201cBut how did you know my name, Ruby?\u201d\n\n\u201cJack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?\u201d says Jack\u2019s mother.\u201cAnd\nthis is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn\u2019t that so, little girlie?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but Jack didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her\nhostess.\u201cI just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and\nthen I heard auntie call you it.\u201d For at Mrs.Kirke\u2019s own request,\nthe little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.\u201cI\u2019ve got\na dolly called after you,\u201d goes on the child with sweet candour.\u201cMay\nKirke\u2019s her name, and Jack says it\u2019s the prettiest name he ever heard,\n\u2018May Kirke,\u2019 I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I\ncould only call her half after him, I called her the other half after\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?\u201d May asks in some\namazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one\ncould accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.\u201cIt was on the card,\u201d Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack\nthat he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.\u201cJack left it\nbehind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name\nwas on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to\nJack.I didn\u2019t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,\u201d Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white\ngirl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand\nand heart.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter\u2019s\ndeath when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond\nmother\u2019s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but\nMay\u2019s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.Kirke,\u201d the young lady says, rising.She\ncannot bear that any more of Ruby\u2019s revelations, however welcome to\nher own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack\u2019s mother.\u201cI have\ninflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see\nme, darling, won\u2019t you?\u201d this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be\nso kind as to bring you some day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll bring May Kirke too,\u201d Ruby cries.It may have been the\nfirelight which sends an added redness to the other May\u2019s cheeks, as\nRuby utters the name which Jack has said is \u201cthe prettiest he has ever\nheard.\u201d\n\nRuby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from\nwhich Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d Ruby cries, \u201cyou\u2019re just in time!I\u2019ve forgotten her other name, so I\u2019m just going to call her Miss\nMay.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I see you home?\u201d Jack Kirke asks.\u201cIt is too dark now for you to\ngo by yourself.\u201d He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has\nknown since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love\nbecause she had no love to give in return, and May\u2019s eyes fall beneath\nhis gaze.\u201cVery well,\u201d she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,\npities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.The little\ngirl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a\nlight than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest\nland of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most\ncommon of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this\nwoman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;\nMay tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came\ntoo late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.\u201cWhat a nice little girl Ruby is,\u201d says May at length, trying to fill\nup a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.\u201cYour mother seems so fond\nof her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the dearest little girl in the world,\u201d Jack Kirke declares.His\neyes involuntarily meet May\u2019s blue ones, and surely something which was\nnot there before is shining in their violet depths--\u201cexcept,\u201d he says,\nthen stops.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.\u201cMay,\u201d very softly, \u201cwill you let me say it?\u201d\n\nMay answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her\neyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently\nin this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question\nchooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an\nold, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and\nfresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;\na story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the\nbeautiful, glamorous mystery of \u201clove\u2019s young dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd are you sure,\u201d Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner\ncommon to young lovers, \u201cthat you really love me now, May?that I\nshan\u2019t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I\u2019m very\ndense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it\nwas too good to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure,\u201d May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside\nwhom all others to her are but \u201cas shadows,\u201d unalterable trust in her\nblue eyes.\u201cJack,\u201d very low, \u201cI think I have loved you all my life.\u201d\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201c_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,\u201d Ruby remarks in rather an offended\nvoice when she hears the news.\u201cBut I s\u2019pose you thought I was too\nlittle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was just it, Ruby red,\u201d Jack tells her, and stifles further\nremonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED\n  LONDON AND BECCLES.TRANSCRIBER\u2019S NOTES:\n\n\n  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.They explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.Finding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they\ndecide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.Sometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the\novipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edge of\nthe slit.Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly\nregular and absolutely white layer.We have seen the Bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,\nnotwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,\nwithout hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal.Can the nature\nof the floor make any difference to her?I replace the tin lid by a\npaper cover stretched and pasted over the orifice.With the point of my\nknife I make a narrow slit in this new lid.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.That is quite enough: the\nparent accepts the paper.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.What determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can\neasily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the\ncrevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched\noutside, near the narrow passage.The maggots' mother has her own\nlogic, her prudent foresight.She knows how feeble her wee grubs will\nbe, how powerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any\nresistance; and so, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains\nfrom laying, so long as she finds no entrance through which the\nnew-born worms can slip unaided.I wanted to know whether the colour, the shininess, the degree of\nhardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the\ndecision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional\nconditions.With this object in view, I employed small jars, each\nbaited with a bit of butcher's meat.The respective lids were made of\ndifferent- paper, of oil-skin, or of some of that tin-foil,\nwith its gold or coppery sheen, which is used for sealing\nliqueur-bottles.On not one of these covers did the mothers stop, with\nany desire to deposit their eggs; but, from the moment that the knife\nhad made the narrow slit, all the lids were, sooner or later, visited\nand all, sooner or later, received the white shower somewhere near the\ngash.The look of the obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or\nbrilliant, drab or : these are details of no importance; the\nthing that matters is that there should be a passage to allow the grubs\nto enter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.Though hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the\nnew-born worms are well able to find their refectory.As they release\nthemselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their\nscent, they slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the\npassage cut by the knife.Behold them entering upon their promised\nland, their reeking paradise.Eager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall?Slowly creeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use\ntheir fore-part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel\nin one.They reach the meat and at once instal themselves upon it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.Let us continue our investigation, varying the conditions.A large\ntest-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a\nlump of butcher's meat.It is closed with wire-gauze, whose meshes, two\nmillimetres wide (.078 inch.--Translator's Note.), do not permit of the\nFly's passage.The Bluebottle comes to my apparatus, guided by scent\nrather than sight.She hastens to the test-tube, whose contents are\nveiled under an opaque cover, with the same alacrity as to the open\ntube.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.The invisible attracts her quite as much as the visible.She stays awhile on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;\nbut, whether because circumstances failed to serve me, or because the\nwire network inspired her with distrust, I never saw her dab her eggs\nupon it for certain.As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse to\nthe Flesh-fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).This Fly is less finicking in her preparations, she has more faith in\nthe strength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous,\nand easily shows me what I wish to see.She explores the trellis-work,\nchooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen, and,\nundisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain\nnumber of grubs, about ten or so.True, her visits will be repeated,\nincreasing the family at a rate of which I am ignorant.The new-born worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to\nthe wire-gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into\nthe chasm.When this is done, the\nmother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift\nfor themselves.If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall\nelsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.This confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no\nindication but that of smell, deserves fuller investigation.From what\nheight will the Flesh-fly dare to let her children drop?I top the\ntest-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret-bottle.The mouth is closed either with wire-gauze or with a paper cover with a\nslight cut in it.Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches\nin height.No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of\nthe young grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with\nlarvae, in which it is easy to recognize the Flesh-fly's family by the\nfringed coronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the\npetals of a little flower.I did not see the mother operating: I was\nnot there at the time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming,\nnor of the great dive taken by the", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "I admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube\nby another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high.The\ncolumn is erected at a spot frequented by Flies, in a dim light.Its\nmouth, closed with a wire-gauze cover, reaches the level of various\nother appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or\nawaiting their colony of vermin.When the position is well-known to the\nFlies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors\nshould turn aside to easier ground.From time to time the Bluebottle and the Flesh-fly perch on the\ntrellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp.Throughout\nthe summer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where\nit is, without result: never a worm.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Does the\nstench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth?Certainly it\nspreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still more so to\nthe nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness.Then why does\nthe Flesh-fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,\nrefuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high?Does\nshe fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop?There\nis nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the\nshaft.I never see her explore the tube or take its size.She stands on\nthe trellised orifice; and there the matter ends.Can she be apprised\nof the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive\nodours that arise from it?Can the sense of smell measure the distance\nand judge whether it be acceptable or not?The fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the\nFlesh-fly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls.Can she\nknow beforehand that, when the chrysalids break, her winged family,\nknocking with a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will\nbe unable to get out?This foresight would be in agreement with the\nrules which order maternal instinct according to future needs.But, when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms\nof the Flesh-fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments\nshow.This principle has a practical application which is not without\nits value in matters of domestic economy.It is as well that the\nwonders of entomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace\nutility.The usual meat-safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom of\nwood and four wire-gauze sides.Hooks fixed into the top are used\nwhereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the Flies.Often,\nso as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are\nsimply laid on the floor of the cage.With these arrangements, are we\nsure of warding off the Fly and her vermin?We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not\nmuch inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is\nstill the Flesh-fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to\nwork and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop\nthem inside the safe.Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the\nworms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure\nfrom their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling.It is\nnot in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this\nimplies climbing down a string in addition.People also use wire-gauze dish-covers.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.The trellised dome protects the\ncontents even less than does the meat-safe.The Flesh-fly takes no heed\nof it.She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.We need only wrap the\nbirds which we wish to preserve--Thrushes, Partridges, Snipe and so\non--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.This defensive armour alone, while leaving ample room for the air to\ncirculate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible; even without a\ncover or a meat-safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative\nvirtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier.The\nBluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the\nFlesh-fly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that\ntheir new-born young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.Paper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those\nplagues of our furs and clothes.To keep away these wholesale ravagers,\npeople generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of\nlavender, and other strong-scented remedies.Without wishing to malign\nthose preservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are\nnone too effective.The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of\nthe Moths.I would therefore advise our housewives, instead of all this chemist's\nstuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size.Take whatever\nyou wish to protect--your furs, your flannel, or your clothes--and pack\neach article carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double\nfold, well pinned.If this joining is properly done, the Moth will\nnever get inside.Since my advice has been taken and this method\nemployed in my household, the old damage has no longer been repeated.A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer\nof fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick.The jar has a wide mouth\nand is left quite open.Let whoso come that will, attracted by the\nsmell.The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared\nfor them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring\ninto the invisible thing revealed by its fragrance.A diligent watch\nenables me to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse,\ntapping it with their feet, sounding it with their proboscis.I leave\nthe visitors undisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks.This is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed\nme.The Flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same\nreasons.The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin\nwould not be able to overcome.Its\ngrittiness would hurt the new-born weaklings, its dryness would absorb\nthe moisture indispensable to their movements.Later, when preparing\nfor the metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs\nwill dig the earth quite well and be able to descend: but, at the\nstart, that would be very dangerous for them.Knowing these\ndifficulties, the mothers, however greatly tempted by the smell,\nabstain from breeding.As a matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing\nlest some packets of eggs may have escaped my attention, I inspect the\ncontents of the jar from top to bottom.Meat and sand contain neither\nlarvae nor pupae: the whole is absolutely deserted.The layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment\nrequires certain precautions.The meat may expand a little, in going\nbad, and protrude in one or two places.However small the fleshy eyots\nthat show above the surface, the Flies come to them and breed.Sometimes also the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small\nextent of the sandy floor.That is enough for the maggot's first\nestablishment.These causes of failure are avoided with a layer of sand\nabout an inch thick.Then the Bluebottle, the Flesh-fly, and other\nFlies whose grubs batten on dead bodies are kept at a proper distance.In the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,\npulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.Let us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric.The chemistry of man's\nfinal dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need\nto add imaginary horrors.The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of\ncantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are.Covered by\nbut a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no Fly\nwill ever come to take advantage of them.At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion is\npossible; aye, it is the invariable rule.For the melting down and\nremoulding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the\nlowest of the brutes.Then the Fly exercises her rights and deals with\nus as she does with any ordinary animal refuse.Nature treats us with\nmagnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in\nher crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are 1 and all alike.There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:\nequality in the presence of the maggot.Drover Dingdong's Sheep followed the Ram which Panurge had maliciously\nthrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea, one after the other,\n\"for you know,\" says Rabelais, \"it is the nature of the sheep always to\nfollow the first, wheresoever it goes.\"The Pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike, not from foolishness, but\nfrom necessity: where the first goes all the others go, in a regular\nstring, with not an empty space between them.They proceed in single file, in a continuous row, each touching with\nits head the rear of the one in front of it.The complex twists and\nturns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are\nscrupulously described by all the others.No Greek theoria winding its\nway to the Eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly.Hence the name\nof Processionary given to the gnawer of the pine.His character is complete when we add that he is a rope-dancer all his\nlife long: he walks only on the tight-rope, a silken rail placed in\nposition as he advances.The caterpillar who chances to be at the head\nof the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on\nthe path which his fickle preferences cause him to take.The thread is\nso tiny that the eye, though armed with a magnifying-glass, suspects it\nrather than sees it.But a second caterpillar steps on the slender foot-board and doubles it\nwith his thread; a third trebles it; and all the others, however many\nthere be, add the sticky spray from their spinnerets, so much so that,\nwhen the procession has marched by, there remains, as a record of its\npassing, a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the\nsun.Very much more sumptuous than ours, their system of road-making\nconsists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing.We sprinkle\nour roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy\nsteam-roller; they lay over their paths a soft satin rail, a work of\ngeneral interest to which each contributes his thread.Could they not, like other\ncaterpillars, walk about without these costly preparations?I see two\nreasons for their mode of progression.It is night when the\nProcessionaries sally forth to browse upon the pine-leaves.They leave\ntheir nest, situated at the top of a bough, in profound darkness; they\ngo down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has\nnot yet been gnawed, a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees\nas the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys; they climb up this\nuntouched branch and spread over the green needles.When they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air,\nthe next thing is to return to the shelter of the house.Measured in a\nstraight line, the distance is not great, hardly an arm's length; but\nit cannot be covered in this way on foot.The caterpillars have to\nclimb down from one crossing to the next, from the needle to the twig,\nfrom the twig to the branch, from the branch to the bough and from the\nbough, by a no less angular path, to go back home.It is useless to\nrely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey.The\nProcessionary, it is true, has five ocular specks on either side of his\nhead, but they are so infinitesimal, so difficult to make out through\nthe magnifying-glass, that we cannot attribute to them any great power\nof vision.Besides, what good would those short-sighted lenses be in\nthe absence of light, in black darkness?It is equally useless to think of the sense of smell.Has the\nProcessional any olfactory powers or has he not?Without\ngiving a positive answer to the question, I can at least declare that\nhis sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him\nfind his way.This is proved, in my experiments, by a number of hungry\ncaterpillars that, after a long fast, pass close beside a pine-branch\nwithout betraying any eagerness of showing a sign of stopping.It is\nthe sense of touch that tells them where they are.So long as their\nlips do not chance to light upon the pasture-land, not one of them\nsettles there, though he be ravenous.They do not hasten to food which\nthey have scented from afar; they stop at a branch which they encounter\non their way.Apart from sight and smell, what remains to guide them in returning to\nthe nest?In the Cretan labyrinth, Theseus\nwould have been lost but for the clue of thread with which Ariadne\nsupplied him.The spreading maze of the pine-needles is, especially at\nnight, as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for Minos.The\nProcessionary finds his way through it, without the possibility of a\nmistake, by the aid of his bit of silk.At the time for going home,\neach easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the\nneighbouring threads, spread fanwise by the diverging herd; one by one\nthe scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon, which started from\nthe nest; and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with\nabsolute certainty.Longer expeditions are made in the daytime, even in winter, if the\nweather be fine.Our caterpillars then come down from the tree, venture\non the ground, march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or\nso.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.The object of these sallies is not to look for food, for the native\npine-tree is far from being exhausted: the shorn branches hardly count\namid the vast leafage.Moreover, the caterpillars observe complete\nabstinence till nightfall.The trippers have no other object than a\nconstitutional, a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are\nlike, possibly an inspection of the locality where, later on, they mean\nto bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis.It goes without saying that, in these greater evolutions, the guiding\ncord is not neglected.All\ncontribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets, as is the\ninvariable rule whenever there is a progression.Not one takes a step\nforward without fixing to the path the thread from his lips.If the series forming the procession be at all long, the ribbon is\ndilated sufficiently to make it easy to find; nevertheless, on the\nhomeward journey, it is not picked up without some hesitation.For\nobserve that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely;\nto wheel round on their tight-rope is a method utterly unknown to them.In order therefore to regain the road already covered, they have to\ndescribe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the\nleader's fancy.Hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes\nprolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of\ndoors.To-morrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or\nlater be successful.Oftener still the winding curve meets the\nguide-thread at the first attempt.As soon as the first caterpillar has\nthe rail between his legs, all hesitation ceases; and the band makes\nfor the nest with hurried steps.The use of this silk-tapestried roadway is evident from a second point\nof view.To protect himself against the severity of the winter which he\nhas to face when working, the Pine Caterpillar weaves himself a shelter\nin which he spends his bad hours, his days of enforced idleness.Alone,\nwith none but the meagre resources of his silk-glands, he would find\ndifficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the\nwinds.A substantial dwelling, proof against snow, gales and icy fogs,\nrequires the cooperation of a large number.Out of the individual's\npiled-up atoms, the community obtains a spacious and durable\nestablishment.Every evening, when the\nweather permits, the building has to be strengthened and enlarged.It\nis indispensable, therefore, that the corporation of workers should not\nbe dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are\nstill in the caterpillar stage.But, without special arrangements, each\nnocturnal expedition at grazing-time would be a cause of separation.At\nthat moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism.The caterpillars become more or less scattered, settling singly on the\nbranches around; each browses his pine-needle separately.How are they\nto find one another afterwards and become a community again?The several threads left on the road make this easy.With that guide,\nevery caterpillar, however far he may be, comes back to his companions\nwithout ever missing the way.They come hurrying from a host of twigs,\nfrom here, from there, from above, from below; and soon the scattered\nlegion reforms into a group.The silk thread is something more than a\nroad-making expedient: it is the social bond, the system that keeps the\nmembers of the brotherhood indissolubly united.At the head of every procession, long or short, goes a first\ncaterpillar whom I will call the leader of the march or file, though\nthe word leader, which I use for the want of a better, is a little out\nof place here.Nothing, in fact, distinguishes this caterpillar from\nthe others: it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line\nup; and mere chance brings him to the front.Among the Processionaries,\nevery captain is an officer of fortune.The actual leader leads;\npresently he will be a subaltern, if the line should break up in\nconsequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order.His temporary functions give him an attitude of his own.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.While the\nothers follow passively in a close file, he, the captain, tosses\nhimself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body\nhither and thither.As he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way.Does he in point of fact explore the country?Does he choose the most\npracticable places?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Or are his hesitations merely the result of the\nabsence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered?His subordinates follow very placidly, reassured by the cord which they\nhold between their legs; he, deprived of that support, is uneasy.Why cannot I read what passes under his black, shiny skull, so like a\ndrop of tar to look at?To judge by actions, there is here a modicum of\ndiscernment which is able, after experimenting, to recognize excessive\nroughnesses, over-slippery surfaces, dusty places that offer no\nresistance and, above all, the threads left by other excursionists.This is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the\nProcessionaries has taught me as to their mentality.Poor brains,\nindeed; poor creatures, whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon\na thread!The finest that I have seen\nmanoeuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and\nnumbered about three hundred caterpillars, drawn up with absolute\nprecision in a wavy line.But, if there were only two in a row the\norder would still be perfect: the second touches and follows the first.By February I have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse.What\ntricks can I play upon them?I see only two: to do away with the\nleader; and to cut the thread.The suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking.If\nthe thing is done without creating a disturbance, the procession does\nnot alter its ways at all.The second caterpillar, promoted to captain,\nknows the duties of his rank off-hand: he selects and leads, or rather\nhe hesitates and gropes.The breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either.I remove\na caterpillar from the middle of the file.With my scissors, so as not\nto cause a commotion in the ranks, I cut the piece of ribbon on which\nhe stood and clear away every thread of it.As a result of this breach,\nthe procession acquires two marching leaders, each independent of the\nother.It may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him,\nfrom which he is separated by but a slender interval; in that case,\nthings return to their original condition.More frequently, the two\nparts do not become reunited.In that case, we have two distinct\nprocessions, each of which wanders where it pleases and diverges from\nthe other.Nevertheless, both will be able to return to the nest by\ndiscovering sooner or later, in the course of their peregrinations, the\nribbon on the other side of the break.I have thought\nout another, one more fertile in possibilities.I propose to make the\ncaterpillars describe a close circuit, after the ribbons running from\nit and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed.The locomotive engine pursues its invariable course so long as it is\nnot shunted on to a branch-line.If the Processionaries find the silken\nrail always clear in front of them, with no switches anywhere, will\nthey continue on the same track, will they persist in following a road\nthat never comes to an end?What we have to do is to produce this\ncircuit, which is unknown under ordinary conditions, by artificial\nmeans.The first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the\nsilk ribbon at the back of the train, to bend it without shaking it and\nto bring the end of it ahead of the file.If the caterpillar marching\nin the van steps upon it, the thing is done: the others will follow him\nfaithfully.The operation is very simple in theory but most difficult\nin practice and produces no useful results.The ribbon, which is\nextremely slight, breaks under the weight of the grains of sand that\nstick to it and are lifted with it.If it does not break, the\ncaterpillars at the back, however delicately we may go to work, feel a\ndisturbance which makes them curl up or even let go.There is a yet greater difficulty: the leader refuses the ribbon laid\nbefore him; the cut end makes him distrustful.Failing to see the\nregular, uninterrupted road, he slants off to the right or left, he\nescapes at a tangent.If I try to interfere and to bring him back to\nthe path of my choosing, he persists in his refusal, shrivels up, does\nnot budge, and soon the whole procession is in confusion.We will not\ninsist: the method is a poor one, very wasteful of effort for at best a\nproblematical success.We ought to interfere as little as possible and obtain a natural closed\ncircuit.It lies in our power, without the least\nmeddling, to see a procession march along a perfect circular track.I\nowe this result, which is eminently deserving of our attention, to pure\nchance.On the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nests are planted\nstand some big palm-vases measuring nearly a yard and a half in\ncircumference at the top.The caterpillars often scale the sides and\nclimb up to the moulding which forms a cornice around the opening.This\nplace suits them for their processions, perhaps because of the absolute\nfirmness of the surface, where there is no fear of landslides, as on\nthe loose, sandy soil below; and also, perhaps, because of the\nhorizontal position, which is favourable to repose after the fatigue of\nthe ascent.It provides me with a circular track all ready-made.I have\nnothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plans.On the 30th of January, 1896, a little before twelve o'clock in the\nday, I discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually\nreaching the popular cornice.Slowly, in single file, the caterpillars\nclimb the great vase, mount the ledge and advance in regular\nprocession, while others are constantly arriving and continuing the\nseries.I wait for the string to close up, that is to say, for the\nleader, who keeps following the circular moulding, to return to the\npoint from which he started.My object is achieved in a quarter of an\nhour.The closed circuit is realized magnificently, in something very\nnearly approaching a circle.The next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column, which\nwould disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of\nnewcomers; it is also important that we should do away with all the\nsilken paths, both new and old, that can put the cornice into\ncommunication with the ground.With a thick hair-pencil I sweep away\nthe surplus climbers; with a big brush, one that leaves no smell behind\nit--for this might afterwards prove confusing--I carefully rub down the\nvase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillars have laid on\nthe march.When these preparations are finished, a curious sight awaits\nus.In the interrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader.Each caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heels he follows\nguided by the silk track, the work of the whole party; he again has a\ncompanion close behind him, following him in the same orderly way.And\nthis is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain.None commands, or rather none modifies the trail according to his\nfancy; all obey, trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the\nmarch and who in reality has been abolished by my trickery.From the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk has been\nlaid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the\nprocession, which never ceases dribbling its thread as it goes.The\nrail is simply doubled and has no branches anywhere, for my brush has\ndestroyed them all.What will the caterpillars do on this deceptive,\nclosed path?Will they walk endlessly round and round until their\nstrength gives out entirely?The old schoolmen were fond of quoting Buridan's Ass, that famous\nDonkey who, when placed between two bundles of hay, starved to death\nbecause he was unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the\nequilibrium between two equal but opposite attractions.The Ass, who is no more foolish than any one else,\nwould reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundles.Will my\ncaterpillars show a little of his mother wit?Will they, after many\nattempts, be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit,\nwhich keeps them on a road without a turning?Will they make up their\nminds to swerve to this side or that, which is the only method of\nreaching their bundle of hay, the green branch yonder, quite near, not\ntwo feet off?I thought that they would and I was wrong.I said to myself:\n\n\"The procession will go on turning for some time, for an hour, two\nhours, perhaps; then the caterpillars will perceive their mistake.They\nwill abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or\nother.\"That they should remain up there, hard pressed by hunger and the lack\nof cover, when nothing prevented them from going away, seemed to me\ninconceivable imbecility.Facts, however, forced me to accept the\nincredible.The circular procession begins, as I have said, on the 30th of January,\nabout midday, in splendid weather.The caterpillars march at an even\npace, each touching the stern of the one in front of him.The unbroken\nchain eliminates the leader with his changes of direction; and all\nfollow mechanically, as faithful to their circle as are the hands of a\nwatch.The headless file has no liberty left, no will; it has become\nmere clockwork.My success goes\nfar beyond my wildest suspicions.I stand amazed at it, or rather I am\nstupefied.Meanwhile, the multiplied circuits change the original rail into a\nsuperb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad.I can easily see it\nglittering on the red ground of the pot.The day is drawing to a close\nand no alteration has yet taken place in the position of the trail.The trajectory is not a plane curve, but one which, at a certain point,\ndeviates and goes down a little way to the lower surface of the\ncornice, returning to the top some eight inches farther.I marked these\ntwo points of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset.Well, all\nthat afternoon and, more conclusive still, on the following days, right\nto the end of this mad dance, I see the string of caterpillars dip\nunder the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the\nsecond.Once the first thread is laid, the road to be pursued is\npermanently established.If the road does not vary, the speed does.I measure nine centimetres\n(3 1/2 inches.--Translator's Note.)But there are more or less lengthy halts; the pace slackens at\ntimes, especially when the temperature falls.At ten o'clock in the\nevening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.I\nforesee an early halt, in consequence of the cold, of fatigue and\ndoubtless also of hunger.The caterpillars have come crowding from all\nthe nests in the greenhouse to browse upon the pine-branches planted by\nmyself beside the silken purses.Those in the garden do the same, for\nthe temperature is mild.The others, lined up along the earthenware\ncornice, would gladly take part in the feast; they are bound to have an\nappetite after a ten hours' walk.The branch stands green and tempting\nnot a hand's-breadth away.To reach it they need but go down; and the\npoor wretches, foolish slaves of their ribbon that they are, cannot\nmake up their minds to do so.I leave the famished ones at half-past\nten, persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that\non the morrow things will have resumed their ordinary course.I was expecting too much of them when I accorded them that\nfaint gleam of intelligence which the tribulations of a distressful\nstomach ought, one would think, to have aroused.They are lined up as on the day before, but motionless.When the air\ngrows a little warmer, they shake off their torpor, revive and start\nwalking again.The circular procession begins anew, like that which I\nhave already seen.There is nothing more and nothing less to be noted\nin their machine-like obstinacy.A cold snap has supervened, was indeed\nforetold in the evening by the garden caterpillars, who refused to come\nout despite appearances which to my duller senses seemed to promise a\ncontinuation of the fine weather.At daybreak the rosemary-walks are\nall asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a\nsharp frost.The large pond in the garden is frozen over.What can the\ncaterpillars in the conservatory be doing?All are ensconced in their nests, except the stubborn processionists on\nthe edge of the vase, who, deprived of shelter as they are, seem to\nhave spent a very bad night.I find them clustered in two heaps,\nwithout any attempt at order.They have suffered less from the cold,\nthus huddled together.'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.The severity of the night\nhas caused the ring to break into two segments which will, perhaps,\nafford a chance of safety.Each group, as it survives and resumes its\nwalk, will presently be headed by a leader who, not being obliged to\nfollow a caterpillar in front of him, will possess some liberty of\nmovement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side.Remember that, in the ordinary processions, the caterpillar walking\nahead acts as a scout.While the others, if nothing occurs to create\nexcitement, keep to their ranks, he attends to his duties as a leader\nand is continually turning his head to this side and that,\ninvestigating, seeking, groping, making his choice.And things happen\nas he decides: the band follows him faithfully.Remember also that,\neven on a road which has already been travelled and beribboned, the\nguiding caterpillar continues to explore.There is reason to believe that the Processionaries who have lost their\nway on the ledge will find a chance of safety here.On recovering from their torpor, the two groups line up by degrees into\ntwo distinct files.There are therefore two leaders, free to go where\nthey please, independent of each other.Will they succeed in leaving\nthe enchanted circle?At the sight of their large black heads swaying\nanxiously from side to side, I am inclined to think so for a moment.As the ranks fill out, the two sections of\nthe chain meet and the circle is reconstituted.The momentary leaders\nonce more become simple subordinates; and again the caterpillars march\nround and round all day.For the second time in succession, the night, which is very calm and\nmagnificently starry, brings a hard frost.In the morning the\nProcessionaries on the tub, the only ones who have camped unsheltered,\nare gathered into a heap which largely overflows both sides of the\nfatal ribbon.I am present at the awakening of the numbed ones.The\nfirst to take the road is, as luck will have it, outside the track.Hesitatingly he ventures into unknown ground.He reaches the top of the\nrim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase.He is\nfollowed by six others, no more.Perhaps the rest of the troop, who\nhave not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor, are too lazy to\nbestir themselves.The result of this brief delay is a<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "The\ncaterpillars embark on the silken trail and the circular march is\nresumed, this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it.There is no\nattempt, however, to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom\nthis gap has placed at the head.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.A chance of stepping outside the magic\ncircle has presented itself at last; and he does not know how to avail\nhimself of it.As for the caterpillars who have made their way to the inside of the\nvase, their lot is hardly improved.They climb to the top of the palm,\nstarving and seeking for food.Finding nothing to eat that suits them,\nthey retrace their steps by following the thread which they have left\non the way, climb the ledge of the pot, strike the procession again\nand, without further anxiety, slip back into the ranks.Once more the\nring is complete, once more the circle turns and turns.There is a legend that tells of\npoor souls dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is\nbroken by a drop of holy water.What drop will good fortune sprinkle on\nmy Processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the\nnest?I see only two means of conjuring the spell and obtaining a\nrelease from the circuit.These two means are two painful ordeals.A\nstrange linking of cause and effect: from sorrow and wretchedness good\nis to come.And, first, shriveling as the result of cold, the caterpillars gather\ntogether without any order, heap themselves some on the path, some,\nmore numerous these, outside it.Among the latter there may be, sooner\nor later, some revolutionary who, scorning the beaten track, will trace\nout a new road and lead the troop back home.We have just seen an\ninstance of it.Seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and\nclimbed the palm.True, it was an attempt with no result but still an\nattempt.For complete success, all that need be done would have been to\ntake the opposite <DW72>.In the second place, the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger.A lame\none stops, unable to go farther.In front of the defaulter the\nprocession still continues to wend its way for a short time.The ranks\nclose up and an empty space appears.On coming to himself and resuming\nthe march, the caterpillar who has caused the breach becomes a leader,\nhaving nothing before him.The least desire for emancipation is all\nthat he wants to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps\nwill be the saving path.In short, when the Processionaries' train is in difficulties, what it\nneeds, unlike ours, is to run off the rails.The side-tracking is left\nto the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right\nor left; and this leader is absolutely non-existent so long as the ring\nremains unbroken.Lastly, the breaking of the circle, the one stroke of\nluck, is the result of a chaotic halt, caused principally by excess of\nfatigue or cold.The liberating accident, especially that of fatigue, occurs fairly\noften.In the course of the same day, the moving circumference is cut\nup several times into two or three sections; but continuity soon\nreturns and no change takes place.The bold\ninnovator who is to save the situation has not yet had his inspiration.There is nothing new on the fourth day, after an icy night like the\nprevious one; nothing to tell except the following detail.Yesterday I\ndid not remove the trace left by the few caterpillars who made their\nway to the inside of the vase.This trace, together with a junction\nconnecting it with the circular road, is discovered in the course of\nthe morning.Half the troop takes advantage of it to visit the earth in\nthe pot and climb the palm; the other half remains on the ledge and\ncontinues to walk along the old rail.In the afternoon the band of\nemigrants rejoins the others, the circuit is completed and things\nreturn to their original condition.The night frost becomes more intense, without\nhowever as yet reaching the greenhouse.It is followed by bright\nsunshine in a calm and limpid sky.As soon as the sun's rays have\nwarmed the panes a little, the caterpillars, lying in heaps, wake up\nand resume their evolutions on the ledge of the vase.This time the\nfine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes\nmanifest, apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand.The\nscouting-path inside the vase, which was upholstered in silk yesterday\nand the day before, is to-day followed to its origin on the rim by a\npart of the band and is then deserted after a short loop.The other\ncaterpillars follow the usual ribbon.The result of this bifurcation is\ntwo almost equal files, walking along the ledge in the same direction,\nat a short distance from each other, sometimes meeting, separating\nfarther on, in every case with some lack of order.The crippled, who refuse to go on,\nare many.Breaches increase; files are split up into sections each of\nwhich has its leader, who pokes the front of his body this way and that\nto explore the ground.Everything seems to point to the disintegration\nwhich will bring safety.Before\nthe night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration\nresumed.Heat comes, just as suddenly as the cold did.To-day, the 4th of\nFebruary, is a beautiful, mild day.Numerous festoons of caterpillars, issuing from the nests, meander\nalong the sand on the shelf.Above them, at every moment, the ring on\nthe ledge of the vase breaks up and comes together again.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.For the first\ntime I see daring leaders who, drunk with heat, standing only on their\nhinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim, fling\nthemselves forward into space, twisting about, sounding the depths.The\nendeavour is frequently repeated, while the whole troop stops.The\ncaterpillars' heads give sudden jerks, their bodies wriggle.One of the pioneers decides to take the plunge.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the apple there.The others, still confiding in the perfidious\nsilken path, dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road.The short string detached from the general chain gropes about a great\ndeal, hesitates long on the side of the vase; it goes half-way down,\nthen climbs up again slantwise, rejoins and takes its place in the\nprocession.This time the attempt has failed, though at the foot of the\nvase, not nine inches away, there lay a bunch of pine-needles which I\nhad placed there with the object of enticing the hungry ones.Smell and\nsight told them nothing.Near as they were to the goal, they went up\nagain.Threads were laid on the way and\nwill serve as a lure to further enterprise.The road of deliverance has\nits first landmarks.And, two days later, on the eighth day of the\nexperiment, the caterpillars--now singly, anon in small groups, then\nagain in strings of some length--come down from the ledge by following\nthe staked-out path.At sunset the last of the laggards is back in the\nnest.For seven times twenty-four hours the\ncaterpillars have remained on the ledge of the vase.To make an ample\nallowance for stops due to the weariness of this one or that and above\nall for the rest taken during the colder hours of the night, we will\ndeduct one-half of the time.The average pace is nine centimetres a minute.(3 1/2\ninches.--Translator's Note.)The aggregate distance covered, therefore,\nis 453 metres, a good deal more than a quarter of a mile, which is a\ngreat walk for these little crawlers.The circumference of the vase,\nthe perimeter of the track, is exactly 1 metre 35.(4 feet 5\ninches.--Translator's Note.)Therefore the circle covered, always in\nthe same direction and always without result, was described three\nhundred and thirty-five times.These figures surprise me, though I am already familiar with the\nabysmal stupidity of insects as a class whenever the least accident\noccurs.I feel inclined to ask myself whether the Processionaries were\nnot kept up there so long by the difficulties and dangers of the\ndescent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their\nbenighted minds.The facts, however, reply that the descent is as easy\nas the ascent.The caterpillar has a very supple back, well adapted for twisting round\nprojections or slipping underneath.He can walk with the same ease\nvertically or horizontally, with his back down or up.Besides, he never\nmoves forward until he has fixed his thread to the ground.With this\nsupport to his feet, he has no falls to fear, no matter what his\nposition.I had a proof of this before my eyes during a whole week.As I have\nalready said, the track, instead of keeping on one level, bends twice,\ndips at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at\nthe top a little farther on.At one part of the circuit, therefore, the\nprocession walks on the lower surface of the rim; and this inverted\nposition implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at\neach turn for all the caterpillars from first to last.It is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on\nthe edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of\ninflexion.The caterpillars in distress, starved, shelterless, chilled\nwith cold at night, cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered\nhundreds of times, because they lack the rudimentary glimmers of reason\nwhich would advise them to abandon it.The ordeal of a\nfive hundred yards' march and three to four hundred turns teach them\nnothing; and it takes casual circumstances to bring them back to the\nnest.They would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of\nthe nocturnal encampments and the halts due to fatigue did not cast a\nfew threads outside the circular path.Some three or four move along\nthese trails, laid without an object, stray a little way and, thanks to\ntheir wanderings, prepare the descent, which is at last accomplished in\nshort strings favoured by chance.The school most highly honoured to-day is very anxious to find the\norigin of reason in the dregs of the animal kingdom.Let me call its\nattention to the Pine Processionary.THE NARBONNE LYCOSA, OR BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.Michelet has told us how, as a printer's apprentice in a cellar, he\nestablished amicable relations with a Spider.(Jules Michelet\n(1798-1874), author of \"L'Oiseau\" and \"L'Insecte,\" in addition to the\nhistorical works for which he is chiefly known.As a lad, he helped his\nfather, a printer by trade, in setting type.--Translator's Note.)At a\ncertain hour of the day, a ray of sunlight would glint through the\nwindow of the gloomy workshop and light up the little compositor's\ncase.Then his eight-legged neighbour would come down from her web and\non the edge of the case take her share of the sunshine.The boy did not\ninterfere with her; he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as\na pleasant diversion from the long monotony.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the apple there.When we lack the society\nof our fellow-men, we take refuge in that of animals, without always\nlosing by the change.I do not, thank God, suffer from the melancholy of a cellar: my\nsolitude is gay with light and verdure; I attend, whenever I please,\nthe fields' high festival, the Thrushes' concert, the Crickets'\nsymphony; and yet my friendly commerce with the Spider is marked by an\neven greater devotion than the young type-setter's.I admit her to the\nintimacy of my study, I make room for her among my books, I set her in\nthe sun on my window-ledge, I visit her assiduously at her home, in the\ncountry.The object of our relations is not to create a means of escape\nfrom the petty worries of life, pin-pricks whereof I have my share like\nother men, a very large share, indeed; I propose to submit to the\nSpider a host of questions whereto, at times, she condescends to reply.To what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give rise!To set them forth worthily, the marvellous art which the little printer\nwas to acquire were not too much.One needs the pen of a Michelet; and\nI have but a rough, blunt pencil.Let us try, nevertheless: even when\npoorly clad, truth is still beautiful.The most robust Spider in my district is the Narbonne Lycosa, or\nBlack-bellied Tarantula, clad in black velvet on the lower surface,\nespecially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey\nand white rings around the legs.Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly\nground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.In my harmas laboratory there\nare quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.Rarely do I pass by one of\nthese haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like\ndiamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit.The\nfour others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my\nhouse, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a\ndreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from\nstone to stone.The love of lucre has laid waste the land.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.Because wine\npaid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.Then came\nthe Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land\nis now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy\ngrasses sprout among the pebbles.This waste-land is the Lycosa's\nparadise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred\nburrows within a limited range.These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and\nthen bent elbow-wise.On the edge of\nthe hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts\nand even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.The whole is kept in\nplace and cemented with silk.Often, the Spider confines herself to\ndrawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties\ndown with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades\nfrom the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of\na masonry constructed of small stones.The nature of the kerb is\ndecided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in\nthe close neighbourhood of the building-yard.There is no selection:\neverything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.The direction is perpendicular, in so far as obstacles, frequent in a\nsoil of this kind, permit.A bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted\noutside; but a flint is an immovable boulder which the Spider avoids by\ngiving a bend to her gallery.If more such are met with, the residence\nbecomes a winding cave, with stone vaults, with lobbies communicating\nby means of sharp passages.This lack of plan has no attendant drawbacks, so well does the owner,\nfrom long habit, know every corner and storey of her mansion.If any\ninteresting buzz occur overhead, the Lycosa climbs up from her rugged\nmanor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft.Perhaps she even\nfinds the windings and turnings an advantage, when she has to drag into\nher den a prey that happens to defend itself.As a rule, the end of the burrow widens into a side-chamber, a lounge\nor resting-place where the Spider meditates at length and is content to\nlead a life of quiet when her belly is full.When she reaches maturity and is once settled, the Lycosa becomes\neminently domesticated.I have been living in close communion with her\nfor the last three years.I have installed her in large earthen pans on\nthe window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes.Well,\nit is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her\nhole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm.We may take it then that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does not go\nfar afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and that she\nmakes shift with what she finds upon her threshold.In these\nconditions, the building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry\nceases for lack of materials.The wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice would\nassume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply.With captives to\nwhom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough.Were it only\nwith a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these\nrelations with the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how\nmy subjects are housed.A good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a\nred, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the\nplaces haunted by the Lycosa.Properly moistened into a paste, the\nartificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a\nbore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow.When the receptacle\nis filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,\nperpendicular shaft.I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that\nof the fields.To find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in the\nneighbourhood.When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned\ntopsy-turvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced\nby my art, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den.She does not\ncome out again, seeks nothing better elsewhere.A large wire-gauze\ncover rests on the soil in the pan and prevents escape.In any case, the watch, in this respect, makes no demand upon my\ndiligence.The prisoner is satisfied with her new abode and manifests\nno regret for her natural burrow.There is no attempt at flight on her\npart.Let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than\none inhabitant.To her a neighbour is\nfair game, to be eaten without scruple when one has might on one's\nside.Time was when, unaware of this fierce intolerance, which is more\nsavage still at breeding time, I saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my\noverstocked cages.I shall have occasion to describe those tragedies\nlater.Let us meanwhile consider the isolated Lycosae.They do not touch up\nthe dwelling which I have moulded for them with a bit of reed; at most,\nnow and again, perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom\nat the bottom, they fling out a few loads of rubbish.But all, little\nby little, build the kerb that is to edge the mouth.I have given them plenty of first-rate materials, far superior to those\nwhich they use when left to their own resources.These consist, first,\nfor the foundations, of little smooth stones, some of which are as\nlarge as an almond.With this road-metal are mingled short strips of\nraphia, or palm-fibre, flexible ribbons, easily bent.These stand for\nthe Spider's usual basket-work, consisting of slender stalks and dry\nblades of grass.Lastly, by way of an unprecedented treasure, never yet\nemployed by a Lycosa, I place at my captives' disposal some thick\nthreads of wool, cut into inch lengths.As I wish, at the same time, to find out whether my animals, with the\nmagnificent lenses of their eyes, are able to distinguish colours and\nprefer one colour to another, I mix up bits of wool of different hues:\nthere are red, green, white, and yellow pieces.If the Spider have any\npreference, she can choose where she pleases.The Lycosa always works at night, a regrettable circumstance, which\ndoes not allow me to follow the worker's methods.I see the result; and\nthat is all.Were I to visit the building-yard by the light of a\nlantern, I should be no wiser.The Spider, who is very shy, would at\nonce dive into her lair; and I should have lost my sleep for nothing.Furthermore, she is not a very diligent labourer; she likes to take her\ntime.Two or three bits of wool or raphia placed in position represent\na whole night's work.And to this slowness we must add long spells of\nutter idleness.Two months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my\nexpectations.Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,\nall picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built\nthemselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known.Around the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth\nstones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement.The larger\nstones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal\nthat has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others.It is an interlacing of raphia and\nbits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade.Red\nand white, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order.The\nLycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour.The ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high.Bands\nof silk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the\nwhole resembles a coarse fabric.Without being absolutely faultless,\nfor there are always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker\ncould not handle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.The bird\nlining its nest would do no better.Whoso sees the curious,\nmany- productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my\nindustry, contrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his\nsurprise is great when I confess who the real author is.No one would\never believe the Spider capable of constructing such a monument.It goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren\nwaste-lands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous\narchitecture.I have given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home\nto go in search of materials and she makes use of the limited resources\nwhich she finds around her.Bits of earth, small chips of stone, a few\ntwigs, a few withered grasses: that is all, or nearly all.Wherefore\nthe work is generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly\nattracts attention.My captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially\ntextile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa\ndelights in tall turrets.She understands the art of donjon-building\nand puts it into practice as often as she possesses the means.An\nenthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently\nfixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush\nand wait for the quarry.Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my\ncaptives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements\nof their woolly castle-keep.They are then really magnificent in their\nstately gravity.With their swelling belly contained within the\naperture, their head outside, their glassy eyes staring, their legs\ngathered for a spring, for hours and hours they wait, motionless,\nbathing voluptuously in the sun.Should a tit-bit to her liking happen to pass, forthwith the watcher\ndarts from her tall tower, swift as an arrow from the bow.With a\ndagger-thrust in the neck, she stabs the jugular of the Locust,\nDragon-fly or other prey whereof I am the purveyor; and she as quickly\nscales the donjon and retires with her capture.The performance is a\nwonderful exhibition of skill and speed.Very seldom is a quarry missed, provided that it pass at a convenient\ndistance, within the range of the huntress' bound.But, if the prey be\nat some distance, for instance on the wire of the cage, the Lycosa\ntakes no notice of it.Scorning to go in pursuit, she allows it to roam\nat will.She never strikes except when sure of her stroke.She achieves\nthis by means of her tower.Hiding behind the wall, she sees the\nstranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he\ncomes within reach.Though he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who\napproaches the ambush is lost.This presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's part;\nfor the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims.At best,\nthe ledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt some\nweary wayfarer to use it as a resting-place.But, if the quarry do not\ncome to-day, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later, for\nthe Locusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always able\nto regulate their leaps.Some day or other, chance is bound to bring\none of them within the purlieus of the burrow.This is the moment to\nspring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts.Until then, we maintain a\nstoical vigilance.We shall dine when we can; but we shall end by\ndining.The Lycosa, therefore, well aware of these lingering eventualities,\nwaits and is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence.She has\nan accommodating stomach, which is satisfied to be gorged to-day and to\nremain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long.I have sometimes\nneglected my catering duties for weeks at a time; and my boarders have\nbeen none the worse for it.After a more or less protracted fast, they\ndo not pine away, but are smitten with a wolf-like hunger.All these\nravenous eaters are alike: they guzzle to excess to-day, in\nanticipation of to-morrow's dearth.Chance, a poor stand-by, sometimes contrives very well.At the\nbeginning of the month of August, the children call me to the far side\nof the enclosure, rejoicing in a find which they have made under the\nrosemary-bushes.It is a magnificent Lycosa, with an enormous belly,\nthe sign of an impending delivery.Early one morning, ten days later, I find her preparing for her\nconfinement.A silk network is first spun on the ground, covering an\nextent about equal to the palm of one's hand.It is coarse and\nshapeless, but firmly fixed.This is the floor on which the Spider\nmeans to operate.On this foundation, which acts as a protection from the sand, the\nLycosa fashions a round mat, the size of a two-franc piece and made of\nsuperb white silk.With a gentle, uniform movement, which might be\nregulated by the wheels of a delicate piece of clockwork, the tip of\nthe abdomen rises and falls, each time touching the supporting base a\nlittle farther away, until the extreme scope of the mechanism is\nattained.Then, without the Spider's moving her position, the oscillation is\nresumed in the opposite direction.By means of this alternate motion,\ninterspersed with numerous contacts, a segment of the sheet is\nobtained, of a very accurate texture.When this is done, the Spider\nmoves a little along a circular line and the loom works in the same\nmanner on another segment.The silk disk, a sort of hardy concave paten, now no longer receives\nanything from the spinnerets in its centre; the marginal belt alone\nincreases in thickness.The piece thus becomes a bowl-shaped porringer,\nsurrounded by a wide, flat edge.With one quick emission, the viscous,\npale-yellow eggs are laid in the basin, where they heap together in the\nshape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity.The\nspinnerets are once more set going.With short movements, as the tip of\nthe abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat, they cover up the\nexposed hemisphere.The result is a pill set in the middle of a\ncircular carpet.The legs, hitherto idle, are now working.They take up and break off\none by one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse\nsupporting network.At the same time the fangs grip this sheet, lift it\nby degrees, tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of\neggs.The whole edifice totters, the floor\ncollapses, fouled with sand.By a movement of the legs, those soiled\nshreds are cast aside.Briefly, by means of violent tugs of the fangs,\nwhich pull, and broom-like efforts of the legs, which clear away, the\nLycosa extricates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clear-cut mass,\nfree from any adhesion.It is a white-silk pill, soft to the touch and glutinous.Its size is\nthat of an average cherry.An observant eye will notice, running\nhorizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise\nwithout breaking it.This hem, generally undistinguishable from the\nrest of the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat,\ndrawn over the lower hemisphere.The other hemisphere, through which\nthe youngsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is\nthe texture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid.The work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a\nwhole morning, from five to nine o'clock.Worn out with fatigue, the\nmother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless.Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs\nslung from her stern.Henceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious\nburden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags\nand bumps along the ground.With this load banging against her heels,\nshe goes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey,\nattacks it and devours it.Should some accident cause the wallet to\ndrop off, it is soon replaced.The spinnerets touch it somewhere,\nanywhere, and that is enough: adhesion is at once restored.When the work is done, some of them emancipate themselves, think they\nwill have a look at the country before retiring for good and all.It is\nthese whom we meet at times, wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag\nbehind them.Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and\nthe month of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow\nwill bring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her.I am able\nto procure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain\nexperiments of the highest interest.It is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure\nafter her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and\ndefending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe.If I\ntry to take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair,\nhangs on to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs.I can hear\nthe daggers grating on the steel.No, she would not allow herself to be\nrobbed of the wallet with impunity, if my fingers were not supplied\nwith an implement.By dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps, I take it\nfrom the Lycosa, who protests furiously.I fling her in exchange a pill\ntaken from another Lycosa.It is at once seized in the fangs, embraced\nby the legs and hung on to the spinneret.Her own or another's: it is\nall one to the Spider, who walks away proudly with the alien wallet.This was to be expected, in view of the similarity of the pills\nexchanged.A test of another kind, with a second subject, renders the mistake more\nstriking.I substitute, in the place of the lawful bag which I have\nremoved, the work of the Silky Epeira.The colour and softness of the\nmaterial are the same in both cases; but the shape is quite different.The stolen object is a globe; the object presented in exchange is an\nelliptical conoid studded with angular projections along the edge of\nthe base.The Spider takes no account of this dissimilarity.She\npromptly glues the queer bag to her spinnerets and is as pleased as\nthough she were in possession of her real pill.My experimental\nvillainies have no other consequence beyond an ephemeral carting.When\nhatching-time arrives, early in the case of Lycosa, late in that of the\nEpeira, the gulled Spider abandons the strange bag and pays it no\nfurther attention.Let us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet-bearer's stupidity.After\ndepriving the Lycosa of her eggs, I throw her a ball of cork, roughly\npolished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill.She\naccepts the corky substance, so different from the silk purse, without\nthe least demur.One would have thought that she would recognize her\nmistake with those eight eyes of hers, which gleam like precious\nstones.Lovingly she embraces the\ncork ball, fondles it with her palpi, fastens it to her spinnerets and\nthenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag.Let us give another the choice between the imitation and the real.The\nrightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the\njar.Will the Spider be able to know the one that belongs to her?The\nfool is incapable of doing so.She makes a wild rush and seizes\nhaphazard at one time her property, at another my sham product.Whatever is first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung\nup.If I increase the number", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Attempts at inquiry, attempts at selection\nthere are none.Whatever she snaps up at random she sticks to, be it\ngood or bad.As there are more of the sham pills of cork, these are the\nmost often seized by the Spider.Can the animal be deceived by the soft\ncontact of the cork?I replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or\npaper, kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread.Both are\nvery readily accepted instead of the real bag that has been removed.Can the illusion be due to the colouring, which is light in the cork\nand not unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little\nearth, while it is white in the paper and the cotton, when it is\nidentical with that of the original pill?<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.I give the Lycosa, in\nexchange for her work, a pellet of silk thread, chosen of a fine red,\nthe brightest of all colours.The uncommon pill is as readily accepted\nand as jealously guarded as the others.For three weeks and more the Lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to\nher spinnerets.The reader will remember the experiments described in\nthe preceding section, particularly those with the cork ball and the\nthread pellet which the Spider so foolishly accepts in exchange for the\nreal pill.Well, this exceedingly dull-witted mother, satisfied with\naught that knocks against her heels, is about to make us wonder at her\ndevotion.Whether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in\nthe sun, whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger,\nor whether she be roaming the country before settling down, never does\nshe let go her precious bag, that very cumbrous burden in walking,\nclimbing or leaping.If, by some accident, it become detached from the\nfastening to which it is hung, she flings herself madly on her treasure\nand lovingly embraces it, ready to bite whoso would take it from her.I then hear the points of the\npoison-fangs grinding against the steel of my pincers, which tug in one\ndirection while the Lycosa tugs in the other.But let us leave the\nanimal alone: with a quick touch of the spinnerets, the pill is\nrestored to its place; and the Spider strides off, still menacing.Towards the end of summer, all the householders, old or young, whether\nin captivity on the window-sill or at liberty in the paths of the\nenclosure, supply me daily with the following improving sight.In the\nmorning, as soon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow, the\nanchorites come up from the bottom with their bag and station\nthemselves at the opening.Long siestas on the threshold in the sun are\nthe order of the day throughout the fine season; but, at the present\ntime, the position adopted is a different one.Formerly, the Lycosa\ncame out into the sun for her own sake.Leaning on the parapet, she had\nthe front half of her body outside the pit and the hinder half inside.The eyes took their fill of light; the belly remained in the dark.CHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE VILLAGE ON THE MOUNTAIN\n\n\n\"Tom is wounded!\"He ran to his brother, to find the\nblood flowing freely over Tom's shoulder.\"I--I guess not,\" answered Tom with a gasp of pain.Then, as\nfull of pluck as usual, Tom raised his pistol and fired, hitting\none of the Bumwos in the breast and sending him to the rear,\nseriously wounded.It was evident that Cujo had been mistaken and that there were far\nmore of their enemies around the mountain than they had\nanticipated.From behind the Rover expedition a cry arose,\ntelling that more of the natives were coming from that direction.\"We are being hemmed in,\" said Dick Chester nervously.\"No, let us make a stand,\" came from Rand.\"I think a concerted\nvolley from our pistols and

a blood-curdling yell arose on the sultry air, and the\nBumwos were seen to be approaching from two directions, at right\nangles to each other.cried Dick Rover, and began to fire at one\nof the approaching forces.The fight that followed was, however, short and full of\nconsternation to the Africans.One of the parties was led by King\nSusko himself, and the chief had covered less than half the\ndistance to where the Americans stood when a bullet from Tom\nRover's pistol reached him, wounding him in the thigh and causing\nhim to pitch headlong on the grass.The fall of the leader made the Africans set up a howl of dismay,\nand instead of keeping up the fight they gathered around their\nleader.Then, as the Americans continued to fire, they picked\nKing Susko up and ran off with him.A few spears were hurled at\nour friends, but the whole battle, to use Sam's way of summing up\nafterward, was a regular \"two-for-a-cent affair.\"Soon the Bumwos\nwere out of sight down the mountain side.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.The first work of our friends after they had made certain that the\nAfricans had really retreated, was to attend to Tom's wound and\nthe bruise Randolph Rover had received from the stone.Fortunately\nneither man nor boy was seriously hurt, although Tom carries the\nmark of the spear's thrust to this day.\"I hit old King Susko, and that was\nworth a good deal, for it stopped the battle.If the fight had\nkept on there is no telling how many of us might have been\nkilled.\"While the party was deliberating about what to do next, Cujo\nreappeared.\"I go deep into de cabe when foah Bumwos come on me from behind,\"\nhe explained.\"Da fight an' fight an' knock me down an' tie me wid vines, an'\nden run away.But I broke loose from de vines an' cum just as\nquick as could run.Werry big cabe dat, an' strange waterfall in\nde back.\"\"Let us explore the cave,\" said Dick.Some demurred to this, but the Rover boys could, not be held back,\nand on they went, with Aleck with them.Soon Randolph Rover\nhobbled after them, leaving Cujo and the college students to\nremain on the watch.The cave proved to be a large affair, running all of half a mile\nunder the mountain.There were numerous holes in the roof,\nthrough which the sun shone down, making the use of torches\nunnecessary.To one side was a deep and swiftly flowing stream,\ncoming from the waterfall Cujo had mentioned, and disappearing\nunder the rocks near the entrance to the cavern.shouted Dick, as he gazed on the walls of the\ncave.\"You are, Dick; this is a regular cave of gold, and no mistake.No wonder King Susko wanted to keep us away!\"It was a fascinating scene to\nwatch the sparkling sheet as it thundered downward a distance of\nfully a hundred feet.At the bottom was a pool where the water\nwas lashed into a milky foam which went swirling round and round.suddenly cried Sam, and pointed into\nthe falling water.\"Oh, Uncle Randolph, did you ever see anything\nlike it?\"\"There are no such things as ghosts, Sam,\" replied his uncle.\"Stand here and look,\" answered Sam, and his uncle did as\nrequested.Presently from out of the mist came the form of a man--the\nlikeness of Randolph Rover himself!\"It is nothing but an optical illusion, Sam, such as are produced\nby some magicians on the theater stage.The sun comes down\nthrough yonder hole and reflects your image on the wet rock, which\nin turn reflects the form on the sheet of water.\"And that must be the ghost the natives believe in,\"\nanswered Sam.I can tell you I was\nstartled.\"\"Here is a path leading up past the waterfall,\" said Dick, who had\nbeen making an investigation.\"Take care of where you go,\" warned Randolph Rover.\"There may be\nsome nasty pitfall there.\"\"I'll keep my eyes open,\" responded Dick.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.He ascended the rocks, followed by Sam, while the others brought\nup in the rear.Up over the waterfall was another cave, long and\nnarrow.There was now but little light from overhead, but far in\nthe distance could be seen a long, narrow opening, as if the\nmountain top had been, by some convulsion of nature, split in\nhalf.For beyond the opening was a small plain, covered with short grass\nand surrounded on every side by jagged rocks which arose to the\nheight of fifty or sixty feet.In the center of the plain were a\nnumber of native huts, of logs thatched with palm.CHAPTER XXX\n\nFINDING THE LONG-LOST\n\n\n\"A village!\"\"There are several women and children,\" returned Tom, pointing to\none of the huts.\"I guess the men went away to fight us.\"Let us investigate, but with\ncaution.\"As they advanced, the women and children set up a cry of alarm,\nwhich was quickly taken up in several of the other huts.\"Go away, white men; don't touch us!\"cried a voice in the purest\nEnglish.came from the three Rover boys, and they rushed off in\nall haste toward the nut from which the welcome cry had proceeded.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Anderson Rover was found in the center of the hut, bound fast by a\nheavy iron chain to a post set deeply into the ground.His face\nwas haggard and thin and his beard was all of a foot and a half\nlong, while his hair fell thickly over his shoulders.He was\ndressed in the merest rags, and had evidently suffered much from\nstarvation and from other cruel treatment.\"Do I see aright, or\nis it only another of those wild dreams that have entered my brain\nlately?\"burst out Dick, and hugged his parent\naround the neck.\"It's no dream, father; we are really here,\" put in Tom, as he\ncaught one of the slender hands, while Sam caught the other.And then he added tenderly: \"But\nwe'll take good care of you, now we have found you.\"murmured Anderson Rover, as the brother came up.and the tears began to\nflow down his cheeks.Many a time I\nthought to give up in despair!\"\"We came as soon as we got that message you sent,\" answered Dick.\"But that was long after you had sent it.\"\"And is the sailor, Converse, safe?\"\"Too bad--he was the one friend I had here.\"\"And King Susko has kept you a prisoner all this while?\"\"Yes; and he has treated me shamefully in the bargain.He\nimagined I knew all of the secrets of this mountain, of a gold\nmine of great riches, and he would not let me go; but, instead,\ntried to wring the supposed secret from me by torture.\"\"We will settle accounts with him some day,\" muttered Dick.\"It's\na pity Tom didn't kill him.\"The native women and children were looking in at the doorway\ncuriously, not knowing what to say or do.Turning swiftly, Dick\ncaught one by the arm.\"The key to the lock,\" he demanded, pointing to the lock on the\niron chain which bound Anderson Rover.But the woman shook her head, and pointed off in the distance.\"King Susko has the key,\" explained Anderson Rover.\"You will\nhave to break the chain,\"  And this was at last done, although not\nwithout great difficulty.In the meantime the natives were ordered to prepare a meal for\nAnderson Rover and all of the others, and Cujo was called that he\nmight question the Africans in their own language.The meal was soon forthcoming, the Bumwo women fearing that they\nwould be slaughtered if they did not comply with the demands of\nthe whites.To make sure that the food had not been poisoned,\nDick made several of the natives eat portions of each dish.\"Um know a good deal,\" he remarked.\"Cujo was goin' to tell Dick to do dat.\"\"I am glad the women and children are here,\" said Randolph Rover.\"We can take them with us when we leave and warn King Susko that\nif he attacks us we will kill them.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.I think he will rather let us\ngo than see all of the women and children slaughtered.\"While they ate, Anderson Rover told his story, which is far too\nlong to insert here.He had found a gold mine further up the\ncountry and also this mountain of gold, but had been unable to do\nanything since King Susko had made him and the sailor prisoners.During his captivity he had suffered untold cruelties, but all\nthis was now forgotten in the joy of the reunion with his brother\nand his three sons.It was decided that the party should leave the mountain without\ndelay, and Cujo told the female natives to get ready to move.At\nthis they set up a loud protest, but it availed them nothing, and\nthey soon quieted down when assured that no harm would befall them\nif they behaved.CHAPTER XXXI\n\nHOME AGAIN--CONCLUSION\n\n\nNightfall found the entire expedition, including the women and\nchildren, on the mountain side below the caves.As the party went\ndown the mountain a strict watch was kept for the Bumwo warriors,\nand just as the sun was setting, they were discovered in camp on\nthe trail to the northwest.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.\"We will send out a flag of truce,\" said Randolph Rover.This was done, and presently a tall Bumwo under chief came out in\na plain to hold a mujobo, or \"law talk.\"In a few words Cujo explained the situation, stating that they now\nheld in bondage eighteen women and children, including King\nSusko's favorite wife Afgona.If the whites were allowed to pass\nthrough the country unharmed until they, reached the village of\nKwa, where the Kassai River joins the Congo, they would release\nall of the women and children at that point and they could go back\nto rejoin their husbands and fathers.If, on the other hand, the\nexpedition was attacked the whites would put all of those in\nbondage to instant death.It is not likely that this horrible threat would have been put\ninto execution.As Dick said when relating the particulars of the\naffair afterward.\"We couldn't have done such a terrible thing,\nfor it would not have been human.\"But the threat had the desired\neffect, and in the morning King Susko, who was now on a sick bed,\nsent word that they should go through unmolested.And go through they did, through jungles and over plains, across\nrivers and lakes and treacherous swamps, watching continually for\ntheir enemies, and bringing down many a savage beast that showed\nitself.On the return they fell in with Mortimer Blaze, and he,\nbeing a crack shot, added much to the strength of their command.At last Kwa was reached, and here they found themselves under the\nprotection of several European military organizations.The native\nwomen and children were released, much to their joy, and my\nreaders can rest assured that these Africans lost no time in\ngetting back to that portion of the Dark Continent which they\ncalled home.From Kwa to Boma the journey was comparatively easy.At Stanley\nPool they rested for a week, and all in the party felt the better\nfor it.\"Some day I will go back and open up the mines I have discovered,\"\nsaid Anderson Rover.I want to see my own dear\nnative land first.\"Josiah Crabtree had turned up and been\njoined by Dan Baxter, and both had left for parts unknown.\"I hope we never see them again,\" said Dick, and his brothers said\nthe same.An American ship was in port, bound for Baltimore, and all of our\nparty, including the Yale students, succeeded in obtaining passage\non her for home.The trip was a most delightful one, and no days\ncould have been happier than those which the Rover boys spent\ngrouped around their lather listening to all he had to tell of the\nnumerous adventures which had befallen him since he had left home.A long letter was written to Captain Townsend, telling of the\nfinding of Anderson Rover, and the master of the Rosabel was,\nlater on, sent a gift of one hundred dollars for his goodness to\nthe Rovers.Of course Anderson Rover was greatly interested in what his sons\nhad been doing and was glad to learn that they were progressing so\nfinely at Putnam Hall.\"We will let Arnold Baxter drop,\" he said.\"He is our enemy, I know; but just now we will let the law take\nits course for the rascality he practiced in Albany.\"\"We can afford to let him\ndrop, seeing how well things have terminated for ourselves.\"\"And how happy we are going to be,\" chimed in Sam.\"And how rich--when father settles up that mining claim in the\nWest,\" put in Tom.Here I must bring to a finish the story of the Rover boys'\nadventures in the jungles of Africa.They had started out to find\ntheir father, and they had found him, and for the time being all\nwent well.The home-coming of the Rovers was the occasion of a regular\ncelebration at Valley Brook farm.The neighbors came in from far\nand wide and with them several people from the city who in former\nyears had known Anderson Rover well.It was a time never to be forgotten, and the celebration was kept\nup for several days.Captain Putnam was there, and with him came\nFrank, Fred, Larry, and several others.The captain apologized\nhandsomely to Aleck for the way he had treated the <DW52> man.\"I wish I had been with you,\" said Fred.\"You Rover boys are\nwonders for getting around.\"I think we'll go West next,\" answered Dick.\"Father wants to\nlook up his mining interests, you know.We are going to ask him\nto take us along.\"They did go west, and what adventures they had\nwill be related in a new volume, entitled \"The Rover Boys Out West;\nor, The Search for a Lost Mine.\"\"But we are coming back to Putnam Hall first,\" added Tom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.I thought of it even in the heart of Africa!\"\"I'll tell you, fellows, it's good\nenough to roam around, but, after all, there is no place like\nhome.\"And with this truthful remark from the youngest Rover, let us\nclose this volume, kind reader, hoping that all of us may meet\nagain in the next book of the series, to be entitled, \"The Rover\nBoys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.In this story all\nof our friends will once more play important parts, and we will\nlearn what the Baxters, father and son, did toward wresting the\nRover Boys' valuable mining property from

conviction of the accused.To my sorrow, in my sober moments, with the wine on table, [342] I\nmyself was witness of your criminality, when you thought I was asleep.I saw you _both_ uttering many an expression by moving your eyebrows;\n[343] in your nods there was a considerable amount of language.Your\neyes were not silent, [344] the table, too, traced over with wine;\n[345] nor was the language of the fingers wanting; I understood your\ndiscourse, [346] which treated of that which it did not appear to do;\nthe words, too, preconcerted to stand for certain meanings.And now, the\ntables

fact_,\nas no sister gives to a brother of correct conduct, but _rather such_\nas some voluptuous mistress gives to the eager lover; such as we may\nsuppose that Phoebus did not give to Diana, but that Venus many a time\nsave to her own _dear_ Mars.I cried out; \"whither are you taking those\ntransports that belong to me?On what belongs to myself, I will lay the\nhand of a master, [347] These

as the roses are\nbeauteous when mingled among their _encircling_ lilies; or when the\nMoon is suffering from the enchantment of her steeds; [349] or the Assyrian\nivory [350] which the M\u00e6onian woman has stained, [351] that from length\nof time it may not turn yellow.That complexion _of hers_ was extremely\nlike to these, or to some one of these; and, as it happened, she never\nwas more

been tempted to tear her locks just as they were,\n(and nicely dressed they were) and to make an attack upon her tender\ncheeks.When I looked on her face, my strong arms fell powerless; by arms of\nher own was my mistress defended.I, who the moment before had been so\nsavage, _now_, as a suppliant and of my own accord, entreated that she\nwould give me kisses not inferior _to those given-to my rival_.She\nsmiled, and with heartiness she gave me her best _kisses_; such as might\nhave snatched his three-forked bolts from Jove.To my misery I am _now_\ntormented, lest that other person received them in equal perfection; and\nI hope that those were not of this quality.[352]\n\nThose _kisses,_ too, were far better than those which I taught her; and\nshe seemed to have learned

what would be\nthe consequence if they _were seen?_ You are heaping flames upon\nflames, water upon the sea.From them I suspect that the rest may prove\ncharming, which is so well hidden, concealed beneath the thin dress.But, meanwhile, should you like to receive the gentle breeze which\nthe fan may cause, [530] when waved by my hand?Or is the heat I feel,\nrather that of my own passion, and not of the weather, and is the love\nof the fair burning my inflamed breast?While I am talking, your white\nclothes are sprinkled with the black dust;

by her own feelings must each be kept.If, all\napprehensions removed, any woman is chaste, she, in fact, is chaste; she\nwho sins not, because she cannot, _still_ sins.[558] However well you\nmay have guarded the person, the mind is still unchaste; and, unless it\nchooses, it cannot be constrained.You cannot confine the mind, should\nyou lock up every thing; when all is closed, the unchaste one will be\nwithin.The one who can sin, errs less frequently; the very opportunity\nmakes the impulse to wantonness to be the less powerful.Be persuaded\nby me, and leave off instigating to criminality by constraint; by\nindulgence thou mayst restrain it much more effectually.I have sometimes seen the horse, struggling against his reins, rush on\nlike lightning with his resisting mouth.Soon as ever he felt that rein\nwas given, he stopped, and the loosened bridle lay upon his flowing\nmane.We are ever striving for what is forbidden, and are desiring what\nis denied us; even so does the sick man hanker after the water that is\nforbidden him.Argus used to carry a hundred eyes in his forehead, a\nhundred in his neck; [559] and these Love alone many a time evaded.Dana\u00eb, who, a maid, had been placed in the chamber which was to last\nfor ever with its stone and its iron, [560] became a mother.Penelope,\nalthough she was without a keeper, amid so many youthful suitors,\nremained undefiled.Whatever is hoarded up, we long for it the more, and the very pains\ninvite the thief; few care for what another giants.Not through her beauty is she captivating, but through the fondness\nof her husband; people suppose it to be something unusual which has so\ncaptivated thee.Suppose she is not chaste whom her husband is guarding,\nbut faithless; she is beloved; but this apprehension itself causes\nher value, rather than her beauty.Be indignant if thou dost please;\nforbidden pleasures delight me: if any woman can only say, \"I am\nafraid, that woman alone pleases me.Nor yet is it legal [561] to\nconfine a free-born woman; let these fears harass the bodies of those\nfrom foreign parts.That the keeper, forsooth, may be able to say, 'I\ncaused it she must be chaste for the credit of thy slave.He is too\nmuch of a churl whom a faithless wife injures, and is not sufficiently\nacquainted with the ways of the City; in which Romulus, the son of Ilia,\nand Remus, the son of Ilia, both begotten by Mars, were not born without\na crime being committed.Why didst thou choose a beauty for thyself, if\nshe was not pleasing unless chaste?Those two qualities [562] cannot by\nany means be united.'\"If thou art wise, show indulgence to thy spouse, and lay aside thy\nmorose looks; and assert not the rights of a severe husband.Show\ncourtesy, too, to the friends thy wife shall find thee, and many a\none will she find.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.'Tis thus that great credit accrues at a very small\noutlay of labour.Thus wilt thou be able always to take part in the\nfestivities of the young men, and to see many a thing at home, [563]\nwhich you have not presented to her._A vision, and its explanation._\n\n|Twas night, and sleep weighed down my wearied eyes.Such a vision as\nthis terrified my mind.Beneath a sunny hill, a grove was standing, thick set with holm oaks;\nand in its branches lurked full many a bird.A level spot there was\nbeneath, most verdant with the grassy mead, moistened with the drops of\nthe gently trickling stream.Beneath the foliage of the trees, I was\nseeking shelter from the heat; still, under the foliage of the trees it\nwas hot.seeking for the grass mingled with the variegated flowers,\na white cow was standing before my eyes; more white than the snows at\nthe moment when they have just fallen, which, time has not yet turned\ninto flowing water.More white than the milk which is white with its\nbubbling foam, [564] and at that moment leaves the ewe when milked.[565] A\nbull there was, her companion, he, in his happiness, eas her mate; and\nwith his own one he pressed the tender grass.While he was lying, and\nslowly ruminating upon the grass chewed once again; and once again was\nfeeding on the food eaten by him before; he seemed, as sleep took away\nhis strength, to lay his horned head upon the ground that supported\nit.Hither came a crow, gliding through the air on light wings; and\nchattering, took her seat upon the green sward; and thrice with her\nannoying beak did she peck at the breast of the snow-white cow; and with\nher bill she took away the white hair.Having remained awhile, she left\nthe spot and the bull; but black envy was in the breast of the cow.And when she saw the bulls afar browsing upon the pastures (bulls\nwere browsing afar upon the verdant pastures), thither did she betake\nherself, and she mingled among those herds, and sought out a spot of\nmore fertile grass.\"Come, tell me, whoever thou art, thou interpreter of the dreams of the\nnight, what (if it has any truth) this vision means.\"Thus said I: thus\nspoke the interpreter of the dreams of the night, as he weighed in his\nmind each particular that was seen; \"The heat which thou didst wish to\navoid beneath the rustling leaves, but didst but poorly avoid, was that\nof Love.The cow is thy mistress; that complexion is suited to the fair.Thou wast the male, and the bull with the fitting mate.Inasmuch as the\ncrow pecked at her breast with her sharp beak; an old hag of a procuress\n[566] will tempt the affections of thy mistress.In that, after\nhesitating long, his heifer left the bull, thou wilt be left to be\nchilled in a deserted couch.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Envy and the black spots below the front of\nher breast, show that she is not free from the reproach of inconstancy.\"Thus spoke the interpreter; the blood retreated from my chilled face;\nand profound night stood before my eyes._He addresses a river which has obstructed his passage while he is going\nto his mistress._\n\n|River that hast [567] thy slimy banks planted with reeds, to my\nmistress I am hastening;

and I did not hesitate to pass across thee; and\nthe surface of thy waves then hardly reached to my ancles.Now, from the\nopposite mountain [569] thou dost rush, the snows being melted, and in\nthy turbid stream thou dost pour thy muddied waters.What avails it me\nthus to have hastened?What to have given so little time to rest?What\nto have made the night all one with the day?569*\n\nIf still I must be standing here; if, by no contrivance, thy opposite\nbanks are granted to be trodden by my foot.Now do I long for the wings which the hero, the son of Dana\u00eb, [570]\npossessed, when he bore away the head, thickset with the dreadful\nserpents; now do I wish for the chariot, [571] from which the seed of\nCeres first came, thrown upon the uncultivated ground.Of the wondrous\nfictions of the ancient poets do I speak; no time has produced, nor does\nproduce, nor will produce these wonders.Rather, do thou, stream that\ndost overflow thy wide banks, flow within thy limits, then for ever\nmayst thou run on.Torrent, thou wilt not, believe me, be able to endure\nthe reproaches, if perchance I should be mentioned as detained by thee\nin my love.Rivers ought rather to aid youths in their loves; rivers themselves have\nexperienced what love is.Inachus [572] is said to have flowed pale with\nlove for Melie, [573] the Bithynian Nymph, and to have warmed throughout\nhis cold fords.Not yet was Troy besieged for twice five years, when,\nXanthus, Ne\u00e6ra attracted thy eyes.Besides; did not enduring love for\nthe Arcadian maid force Alpheus [574] to run through various lands?They say, too, that thou, Peneus, didst conceal, in the lands of the\nPhthiotians, Cre\u00fcsa, [575] already betrothed to Xanthus.Why should\nI mention Asopus, whom Thebe, beloved by Mars, [576] received, Thebe,\ndestined to be the parent of five daughters?Should I ask of Achelous,\n\"Where now are thy horns?\"thou wouldst complain that they were broken\naway by the wrathful hand of Hercules.[577] Not of such value was\nCalydon, [578] nor of such value was the whole of \u00c6tolia; still, of\nsuch value was Deianira alone.The enriching Nile, that flows through\nhis seven mouths, who so well conceals the native spot [579] of waters\nso vast, is said not to have been able to overpower by his stream the\nflame that was kindled by Evadne, the daughter of Asopus.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.[580] Enipeus,\ndried up, [581] that he might be enabled to embrace the daughter of\nSalmoneus, bade his waters to depart; his waters, so ordered, did\ndepart.Nor do I pass thee by, who as thou dost roll amid the hollow rocks,\nfoaming, dost water the fields of Argive Tibur [582] whom Ilia [583]\ncaptivated, although she was unsightly in her garb, bearing the marks of\nher nails on her locks, the marks of her nails on her cheeks.Bewailing\nboth the crimes of her uncle, and the fault of Mars, she was wandering\nalong the solitary spots with naked feet.Her the impetuous stream\nbeheld from his rapid waves, and raised his hoarse mouth from the midst\nof his fords, and thus he said: \"Why, in sorrow, art thou pacing my\nbanks, Ilia, the descendant of Laomedon [584] of Ida?<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.And why does no white fillet\n[585] bind thy hair tied up?Why weepest thou, and why spoil thy eyes\nwet with tears?And why beat thy open breast with frenzied hand?That\nman has both flints and ore of iron in his breast, who, unconcerned,\nbeholds the tears on thy delicate face.Ilia, lay aside thy fears; my\npalace shall be opened unto thee; the streams, too, shall obey thee;\nIlia, lay aside thy fears.Among a hundred Nymphs or more, thou shalt\nhold the sway; for a hundred or more does my stream contain.Only,\ndescendant of Troy, despise me not, I pray; gifts more abundant than my\npromises shalt thou receive.\"_Thus_ he said; she casting on the ground her modest eyes, as she wept,\nbesprinkled her warm breast with her tears.Thrice did she attempt to\nfly; thrice did she stop short at the deep waves, as fear deprived her\nof the power of running.Still, at last, as with hostile fingers she\ntore her hair, with quivering lips she uttered these bitter words; \"Oh!would that my bones had been gathered up, and hidden in the tomb of my\nfathers, while yet they could be gathered, belonging to me a virgin!Why\nnow, am I courted [586] for any nuptials, a Vestal disgraced, and to be\ndriven from the altars of Ilium?by the fingers\nof the multitude am I pointed at as unchaste.Let this disgrace be\nended, which marks my features.\"Thus far _did she speak_, and before her swollen eyes she extended her\nrobe; and so, in her despair, did she throw herself [587] into the rapid\nwaters.The flowing stream is said to have placed his hands beneath her\nbreast, and to have conferred on her the privilege of his nuptial couch.'Tis worthy of belief, too, that thou hast been inflamed _with love_ for\nsome maiden; but the groves and woods conceal thy failings.While I have been talking, it has become more swollen with its extending\nwaves, and the deep channel contains not the rushing waters.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.What,\nfurious torrent, hast thou against me?Why, churlish river, interrupt the journey once commenced?What if thou didst flow according to some fixed rule, [588] a river of\nsome note?What if thy fame was mighty throughout the earth?But no name\nhast thou collected from the exhausted rivulets; thou hast no springs,\nno certain abode hast thou.In place of spring, thou hast rain and\nmelted snow; resources which the sluggish winter supplies to thee.Either in muddy guise, in winter time, thou dost speed onward in thy\ncourse; or filled with dust, thou dost pass over the parched ground.What thirsty traveller has been able to drink of thee then?Who has\nsaid, with grateful lips, \"Mayst thou flow on for ever?\"_Onward_ thou dost run, injurious to the flocks, [589] still more\ninjurious to the fields.Perhaps these _mischiefs may move_ others;

\"and she found her reward in vanity and vexation\nof spirit.But had she wedded with the purpose that the believing wife\nshould convert the unbelieving, or confirm the doubting, husband, what\nthen had been her reward?Love and honour upon earth, and an inheritance\nin Heaven with Queen Margaret and those heroines who have been the\nnursing mothers of the church.\"Hitherto Catharine had sat upon a stone beside the priest's feet, and\nlooked up to him as she spoke or listened; but now, as if animated\nby calm, yet settled, feelings of disapprobation, she rose up, and,\nextending her hand towards the monk as she spoke, addressed him with\na countenance and voice which might have become a cherub, pitying,\nand even as much as possible sparing, the feelings of the mortal whose\nerrors he is commissioned to rebuke.she said, \"and can so much of the wishes, hopes,\nand prejudices of this vile world affect him who may be called tomorrow\nto lay down his life for opposing the corruptions of a wicked age and\nbacksliding priesthood?Can it be the severely virtuous Father Clement\nwho advises his child to aim at, or even to think of, the possession of\na throne and a bed which cannot become vacant but by an act of crying\ninjustice to the present possessor?Can it be the wise reformer of\nthe church who wishes to rest a scheme, in itself so unjust, upon\na foundation so precarious?Since when is it, good father, that the\nprincipal libertine has altered his morals so much, to be likely to\ncourt in honourable fashion the daughter of a Perth artisan?Two days\nmust have wrought this change; for only that space has passed since he\nwas breaking into my father's house at midnight, with worse mischief in\nhis mind than that of a common robber.And think you that, if Rothsay's\nheart could dictate so mean a match, he could achieve such a purpose\nwithout endangering both his succession and his life, assailed by the\nDouglas and March at the same time, for what they must receive as an act\nof injury and insult to both their houses?Father Clement, where\nwas your principle, where your prudence, when they suffered you to\nbe bewildered by so strange a dream, and placed the meanest of your\ndisciples in the right thus to reproach you?\"The old man's eyes filled with tears, as Catharine, visibly and\npainfully affected by what she had said, became at length silent.\"By the mouths of babes and sucklings,\" he said, \"hath He rebuked those\nwho would seem wise in their generation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.I thank Heaven, that hath\ntaught me better thoughts than my own vanity suggested, through the\nmedium of so kind a monitress.Yes, Catharine, I must not hereafter\nwonder or exclaim when I see those whom I have hitherto judged too\nharshly struggling for temporal power, and holding all the while the\nlanguage of religious zeal.I thank thee, daughter, for thy salutary\nadmonition, and I thank Heaven that sent it by thy lips, rather than\nthose of a stern reprover.\"Catharine had raised her head to reply, and bid the old man, whose\nhumiliation gave her pain, be comforted, when her eyes were arrested\nby an object close at hand.Among the crags and cliffs which surrounded\nthis place of seclusion, there were two which stood in such close\ncontiguity, that they seemed to have been portions of the same rock,\nwhich, rendered by lightning or by an earthquake, now exhibited a chasm\nof about four feet in breadth, betwixt the masses of stone.Into this\nchasm an oak tree had thrust itself, in one of the fantastic frolics\nwhich vegetation often exhibits in such situations.The tree, stunted\nand ill fed, had sent its roots along the face of the rock in all\ndirections to seek for supplies, and they lay like military lines of\ncommunication, contorted, twisted, and knotted like the immense snakes\nof the Indian archipelago.As Catharine's look fell upon the curious\ncomplication of knotty branches and twisted roots, she was suddenly\nsensible that two large eyes were visible among them, fixed and glaring\nat her, like those of a wild animal in ambush.She started, and, without\nspeaking, pointed out the object to her companion, and looking herself\nwith more strict attention, could at length trace out the bushy red\nhair and shaggy beard, which had hitherto been concealed by the drooping\nbranches and twisted roots of the tree.When he saw himself discovered, the Highlander, for such he proved,\nstepped forth from his lurking place, and, stalking forward, displayed\na colossal person, clothed in a purple, red, and green checked plaid,\nunder which he wore a jacket of bull's hide.His bow and arrows were at\nhis back, his head was bare, and a large quantity of tangled locks, like\nthe glibbs of the Irish, served to cover the head, and supplied all the\npurposes of a bonnet.His belt bore a sword and dagger, and he had in\nhis hand a Danish pole axe, more recently called a Lochaber axe.Through\nthe same rude portal advanced, one by one, four men more, of similar\nsize, and dressed and armed in the same manner.Catharine was too much accustomed to the appearance of the inhabitants\nof the mountains so near to Perth to permit herself to be alarmed, as\nanother Lowland maiden might have been on the same occasion.She saw\nwith tolerable composure these gigantic forms arrange themselves in a\nsemicircle around and in front of the monk and herself, all bending upon\nthem in silence their large fixed eyes, expressing, as far as she could\njudge, a wild admiration of her beauty.She inclined her head to them,\nand uttered imperfectly the usual words of a Highland salutation.The\nelder and leader of the party returned the greeting, and then again\nremained silent and motionless.The monk told his beads; and even\nCatharine began to have strange fears for her personal safety, and\nanxiety to know whether they were to consider themselves at personal\nfreedom.She resolved to make the experiment, and moved forward as if\nto descend the hill; but when she attempted to pass the line of\nHighlanders, they extended their poleaxes betwixt each other, so as\neffectually to occupy each opening through which she could have passed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Somewhat disconcerted, yet not dismayed, for she could not conceive that\nany evil was intended, she sat down upon one of the scattered fragments\nof rock, and bade the monk, standing by her side, be of good courage.\"If I fear,\" said Father Clement, \"it is not for myself; for whether I\nbe brained with the axes of these wild men, like an ox when, worn out\nby labour, he is condemned to the slaughter, or whether I am bound with\ntheir bowstrings, and delivered over to those who will take my life with\nmore cruel ceremony, it can but little concern me, if they suffer thee,\ndearest daughter, to escape uninjured.\"\"We have neither of us,\" replied the Maiden of Perth, \"any cause for\napprehending evil; and here comes Conachar to assure us of it.\"Yet, as she spoke, she almost doubted her own eyes; so altered were\nthe manner and attire of the handsome, stately, and almost splendidly\ndressed youth who, springing like a roebuck from a cliff of considerable\nheight, lighted just in front of her.His dress was of the same tartan\nworn by those who had first made their appearance, but closed at the\nthroat and elbows with a necklace and armlets of gold.The hauberk which\nhe wore over his person was of steel, but so clearly burnished that it\nshone like silver.His arms were profusely ornamented, and his bonnet,\nbesides the eagle's feather marking the quality of chief, was adorned\nwith a chain of gold, wrapt several times around it, and secured by a\nlarge clasp, glistening with pearls.His brooch, by which the tartan\nmantle, or plaid, as it is now called, was secured on the shoulder, was\nalso of gold, large and curiously carved.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.He bore no weapon in his hand,\nexcepting a small sapling stick with a hooked head.His whole appearance\nand gait, which used formerly to denote a sullen feeling of conscious\ndegradation, was now bold, forward, and haughty; and he stood before\nCatharine with smiling confidence, as if fully conscious of his improved\nappearance, and waiting till she should recognise him.\"Conachar,\" said Catharine, desirous to break this state of suspense,\n\"are these your father's men?\"\"No, fair Catharine,\" answered the young man.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"Conachar is no more,\nunless in regard to the wrongs he has sustained, and the vengeance\nwhich they demand.I am Ian Eachin MacIan, son to the chief of the Clan\nQuhele.I have moulted my feathers, as you see, when I changed my name.And for these men, they are not my father's followers, but mine.You\nsee only one half of them collected: they form a band consisting of my\nfoster father and eight sons, who are my bodyguard, and the children of\nmy belt, who breathe but to do my will.But Conachar,\" he added, in a\nsofter tone of voice, \"lives again so soon as Catharine desires to see\nhim; and while he is the young chief of the Clan Quhele to all others,\nhe is to her as humble and obedient as when he was Simon Glover's\napprentice.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the milk.See, here is the stick I had from you when we nutted\ntogether in the sunny braes of Lednoch, when autumn was young in the\nyear that is gone.I would not exchange it, Catharine, for the truncheon\nof my tribe.\"While Eachin thus spoke, Catharine began to doubt in her own mind\nwhether she had acted prudently in requesting the assistance of a bold\nyoung man, elated, doubtless, by his sudden elevation from a state of\nservitude to one which she was aware gave him extensive authority over a\nvery lawless body of adherents.\"You do not fear me, fair Catharine?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.said the young chief, taking her\nhand.\"I suffered my people to appear before you for a few minutes,\nthat I might see how you could endure their presence; and methinks you\nregarded them as if you were born to be a chieftain's wife.\"\"I have no reason to fear wrong from Highlanders,\" said Catharine,\nfirmly; \"especially as I thought Conachar was with them.Conachar has\ndrunk of our cup and eaten of our bread; and my father has often had\ntraffic with Highlanders, and never was there wrong or quarrel betwixt\nhim and them.\"replied Hector, for such is the Saxon equivalent for Eachin,\n\"what!never when he took the part of the Gow Chrom (the bandy legged\nsmith) against Eachin MacIan?Say nothing to excuse it, and believe it\nwill be your own fault if I ever again allude to it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.But you had some\ncommand to lay upon me; speak, and you shall be obeyed.\"Catharine hastened to reply; for there was something in the young\nchief's manner and language which made her desire to shorten the\ninterview.\"Eachin,\" she said, \"since Conachar is no longer your name, you ought\nto be sensible that in claiming, as I honestly might, a service from my\nequal, I little thought that I was addressing a person of such superior\npower and consequence.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.You, as well as I, have been obliged to the\nreligious instruction of this good man.He is now in great danger:\nwicked men have accused him with false charges, and he is desirous to\nremain in safety and concealment till the storm shall pass away.\"Ay, the worthy clerk did much for me, and\nmore than my rugged temper was capable to profit by.I will be glad to\nsee any one in the town of Perth persecute one who hath taken hold of\nMacIan's mantle!\"\"It may not be safe to trust too much to that,\" said Catharine.\"I\nnothing doubt the power of your tribe; but when the Black Douglas takes\nup a feud, he is not to be scared by the shaking of a Highland plaid.\"The Highlander disguised his displeasure at this speech with a forced\nlaugh.\"The sparrow,\" he said, \"that is next the eye seems larger than the\neagle that is perched on Bengoile.You fear the Douglasses most, because\nthey sit next to you.You will not believe how\nwide our hills, and vales, and forests extend beyond the dusky barrier\nof yonder mountains, and you think all the world lies on the banks of\nthe Tay.But this good clerk shall see hills that could hide him were\nall the Douglasses on his quest--ay, and he shall see men enough also\nto make them glad to get once more southward of the Grampians.And\nwherefore should you not go with the good man?I will send a party to\nbring him in safety from Perth, and we will set up the old trade beyond\nLoch Tay--only no more cutting out of gloves for me.I will find your\nfather in hides, but I will not cut them, save when they are on the\ncreatures' backs.\"\"My father will come one day and see your housekeeping, Conachar--I\nmean, Hector.But times must be quieter, for there is feud between the\ntownspeople and the followers of the noblemen, and there is speech of\nwar about to break out in the Highlands.\"and were it not for that same Highland\nwar, you should nor thus put off your Highland visit, my pretty\nmistress.But the race of the hills are no longer to be divided into two\nnations.They will fight like men for the supremacy, and he who gets it\nwill deal with the King of Scotland as an equal, not as a superior.Pray\nthat the victory may fall to MacIan, my pious St.Catharine, for thou\nshalt pray for one who loves thee dearly.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.\"I will pray for the right,\" said Catharine; \"or rather, I will pray\nthat there be peace on all sides.Farewell, kind and excellent Father\nClement.Believe I shall never forget thy lessons; remember me in thy\nprayers.But how wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome?\"\"They shall carry him if need be,\" said Hector, \"if we go far without\nfinding a horse for him.But you, Catharine--it is far from hence to\nPerth.Let me attend you thither as I was wont.\"\"If you were as you were wont, I would not refuse your escort.But gold\nbrooches and bracelets are perilous company, when the Liddesdale and\nAnnandale lancers are riding as throng upon the highway as the leaves\nat Hallowmass; and there is no safe meeting betwixt Highland tartans and\nsteel jackets.\"She hazarded this remark, as she somewhat suspected that, in casting his\nslough, young Eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits which he had\nacquired in his humbler state, and that, though he might use bold words,\nhe would not be rash enough to brave the odds of numbers, to which a\ndescent into the vicinity of the city would be likely to expose him.It\nappeared that she judged correctly; for, after a farewell, in which she\ncompounded for the immunity of her lips by permitting him to kiss her\nhand, she returned towards Perth, and could obtain at times, when\nshe looked back, an occasional glance of the Highlanders, as, winding\nthrough the most concealed and impracticable paths, they bent their way\ntowards the North.She felt in part relieved from her immediate anxiety, as the distance\nincreased betwixt her and these men, whose actions were only directed by\nthe will of their chief, and whose chief was a giddy and impetuous boy.She apprehended no insult on her return to Perth from the soldiery of\nany party whom she might meet; for the rules of chivalry were in those\ndays a surer protection to a maiden of decent appearance than an escort\nof armed men, whose cognizance might not be acknowledged as friendly\nby any other party whom they might chance to encounter.But more remote\ndangers pressed on her apprehension.The pursuit of the licentious\nPrince was rendered formidable by threats which his unprincipled\ncounsellor, Ramorny, had not shunned to utter against her father, if she\npersevered in her coyness.These menaces, in such an age, and from such\na character, were deep grounds for alarm; nor could she consider the\npretensions to her favour which Conachar had scarce repressed during his\nstate of servitude, and seemed now to avow boldly, as less fraught with\nevil, since there had been repeated incursions of the Highlanders into\nthe very town of Perth, and citizens had, on more occasions than one,\nbeen made prisoners and carried off from their own houses, or had fallen\nby the claymore in the very streets of their city.She feared, too, her\nfather's importunity on behalf of the smith, of whose conduct on St.Valentine's Day unworthy reports had reached her; and whose suit, had\nhe stood clear in her good opinion, she dared not listen to, while\nRamorny's threats of revenge upon her father rung on her ear.She\nthought on these various dangers with the deepest apprehension, and an\nearnest desire to escape from them and herself, by taking refuge in the\ncloister; but saw no possibility of obtaining her father's consent to\nthe only course from which she expected peace and protection.In the course of these reflections, we cannot discover that she very\ndistinctly regretted that her perils attended her because she was the\nFair Maid of Perth.This was one point which marked that she was not\nyet altogether an angel; and perhaps it was another that, in despite of\nHenry Smith's real or supposed delinquencies, a sigh escaped from her\nbosom when she thought upon St.Oh, for a draught of power to steep\n     The soul of agony in sleep!We have shown the secrets of the confessional; those of the sick\nchamber are not hidden from us.The darkened apartment, where salves and\nmedicines showed that the leech had been busy in his craft, a tall thin\nform lay on a bed, arrayed in a nightgown belted around him, with\npain on his brow, and a thousand stormy passions agitating his bosom.Everything in the apartment indicated a man of opulence and of expense.Henbane Dwining, the apothecary, who seemed to have the care of the\npatient, stole with a crafty and catlike step from one corner of the\nroom to another, busying himself with mixing medicines and preparing\ndressings.The sick man groaned once or twice, on which the leech,\nadvancing to his bedside, asked whether these sounds were a token of the\npain of his body or of the distress of his mind.\"Of both, thou poisoning varlet,\" said Sir John Ramorny, \"and of being\nencumbered with thy accursed company.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.\"If that is all, I can relieve your knighthood of one of these ills\nby presently removing myself elsewhere.Thanks to the feuds of this\nboisterous time, had I twenty hands, instead of these two poor servants\nof my art (displaying his skinny palms), there is enough of employment\nfor them--well requited employment, too, where thanks and crowns contend\nwhich shall best pay my services; while you, Sir John, wreak upon your\nchirurgeon the anger you ought only to bear against the author of your\nwound.\"\"Villain, it is beneath me to reply to thee,\" said the patient; \"but\nevery word of thy malignant tongue is a dirk, inflicting wounds which\nset all the medicines of Arabia at defiance.\"\"Sir John, I understand you not; but if you give way to these\ntempestuous fits of rage, it is impossible but fever and inflammation\nmust be the result.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the apple there.\"Why then dost thou speak in a sense to chafe my blood?Why dost thou\nname the supposition of thy worthless self having more hands than\nnature gave thee, while I, a knight and gentleman, am mutilated like a\n<DW36>?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.\"Sir John,\" replied the chirurgeon, \"I am no divine, nor a mainly\nobstinate believer in some things which divines tell us.Yet I may\nremind you that you have been kindly dealt with; for if the blow which\nhas done you this injury had lighted on your neck, as it was aimed, it\nwould have swept your head from your shoulders, instead of amputating a\nless considerable member.\"\"I wish it had, Dwining--I wish it had lighted as it was addressed.I\nshould not then have seen a policy which had spun a web so fine as mine\nburst through by the brute force of a drunken churl.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.I should not have\nbeen reserved to see horses which I must not mount, lists which I must\nno longer enter, splendours which I cannot hope to share, or battles\nwhich I must not take part in.I should not, with a man's passions for\npower and for strife, be set to keep place among the women, despised by\nthem, too, as a miserable, impotent <DW36>, unable to aim at obtaining\nthe favour of the sex.\"\"Supposing all this to be so, I will yet pray of your knighthood to\nremark,\" replied Dwining, still busying himself with arranging the\ndressings of the wounds, \"that your eyes, which you must have lost\nwith your head, may, being spared to you, present as rich a prospect of\npleasure as either ambition, or victory in the list or in the field, or\nthe love of woman itself, could have proposed to you.\"\"My sense is too dull to catch thy meaning, leech,\" replied Ramorny.\"What is this precious spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck?\"\"The dearest that mankind knows,\" replied Dwining; and then, in the\naccent of a lover who utters the name of his beloved mistress, and\nexpresses his passion for her in the very tone of his voice, he added\nthe word \"REVENGE!\"The patient had raised himself on his couch to listen with some anxiety\nfor the solution of the physician's enigma.He laid himself down again\nas he heard it explained, and after a short pause asked, \"In what\nChristian college learned you this morality, good Master Dwining?\"\"In no Christian college,\" answered his physician;

\"yet I see no better remedy.\"\"There is none other,\" said the leech, to whose evil nature his patron's\ndistress was delicious nourishment.\"In the mean while, it is believed\nyou are confined by the consequences of some bruises, aiding the sense\nof displeasure at the Prince's having consented to dismiss you from his\nhousehold at the remonstrance of Albany, which is publicly known.\"\"Villain, thou rack'st me!\"\"Upon the whole, therefore,\" said Dwining, \"your knighthood has escaped\nwell, and, saving the lack of your hand, a mischance beyond remedy,\nyou ought rather to rejoice than complain; for no barber chirurgeon in\nFrance or England could have more ably performed the operation than this\nchurl with one downright blow.\"\"I understand my obligation fully,\" said Ramorny, struggling with his\nanger, and affecting composure; \"and if Bonthron pays him not with a\nblow equally downright, and rendering the aid of the leech unnecessary,\nsay that John of Ramorny cannot requite an obligation.\"\"And let me further say, that the operator's skill must have been\nvain, and the hemorrhage must have drained your life veins, but for the\nbandages, the cautery, and the styptics applied by the good monks, and\nthe poor services of your humble vassal, Henbane Dwining.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.\"Peace,\" exclaimed the patient, \"with thy ill omened voice and worse\nomened name!Methinks, as thou mentionest the tortures I have undergone,\nmy tingling nerves stretch and contract themselves as if they still\nactuated the fingers that once could clutch a dagger.\"\"That,\" explained the leech, \"may it please your knighthood, is a\nphenomenon well known to our profession.There have been those among\nthe ancient sages who have thought that there still remained a sympathy\nbetween the severed nerves and those belonging to the amputated\nlimb; and that the several fingers are seen to quiver and strain, as\ncorresponding with the impulse which proceeds from their sympathy with\nthe energies of the living system.Could we recover the hand from the\nCross, or from the custody of the Black Douglas, I would be pleased to\nobserve this wonderful operation of occult sympathies.But, I fear me,\none might as safely go to wrest the joint from the talons of an hungry\neagle.\"\"And thou mayst as safely break thy malignant jests on a wounded lion as\non John of Ramorny,\" said the knight, raising himself in uncontrollable\nindignation.\"Caitiff, proceed to thy duty; and remember, that if my\nhand can no longer clasp a dagger, I can command an hundred.\"\"The sight of one drawn and brandished in anger were sufficient,\" said\nDwining, \"to consume the vital powers of your chirurgeon.But who then,\"\nhe added in a tone partly insinuating, partly jeering--\"who would then\nrelieve the fiery and scorching pain which my patron now suffers, and\nwhich renders him exasperated even with his poor servant for quoting the\nrules of healing, so contemptible, doubtless, compared with the power of\ninflicting wounds?\"Then, as daring no longer to trifle with the mood of his dangerous\npatient, the leech addressed himself seriously to salving the wound,\nand applied a fragrant balm, the odour of which was diffused through the\napartment, while it communicated a refreshing coolness, instead of the\nburning heat--a change so gratifying to the fevered patient, that, as\nhe had before groaned with agony, he could not now help sighing for\npleasure, as he sank back on his couch to enjoy the ease which the\ndressing bestowed.\"Your knightly lordship now knows who is your friend,\" said Dwining;\n\"had you yielded to a rash impulse, and said, 'Slay me this worthless\nquacksalver,' where, within the four seas of Britain, would you have\nfound the man to have ministered to you as much comfort?\"\"Forget my threats, good leech,\" said Ramorny, \"and beware how you tempt\nme.Such as I brook not jests upon our agony.See thou keep thy scoffs,\nto pass upon misers [that is, miserable persons, as used in Spenser and\nother writers of his time, though the sense is now restricted to those\nwho are covetous] in the hospital.\"Dwining ventured to say no more, but poured some drops from a phial\nwhich he took from his pocket into a small cup of wine allayed with\nwater.\"This draught,\" said the man of art, \"is medicated to produce a sleep\nwhich must not be interrupted.\"\"The period of its operation is uncertain--perhaps till morning.\"\"Sir mediciner, taste me that\nliquor presently, else it passes not my lips.\"The leech obeyed him, with a scornful smile.\"I would drink the whole\nwith readiness; but the juice of this Indian gum will bring sleep on the\nhealthy man as well as upon the patient, and the business of the leech\nrequires me to be a watcher.\"\"I crave your pardon, sir leech,\" said Ramorny, looking downwards, as if\nashamed to have manifested suspicion.\"There is no room for pardon where offence must not be taken,\" answered\nthe mediciner.\"An insect must thank a giant that he does not tread on\nhim.Yet, noble knight, insects have their power of harming as well as\nphysicians.What would it have cost me, save a moment's trouble, so to\nhave drugged that balm, as should have made your arm rot to the shoulder\njoint, and your life blood curdle in your veins to a corrupted jelly?What is there that prevented me to use means yet more subtle, and to\ntaint your room with essences, before which the light of life twinkles\nmore and more dimly, till it expires, like a torch amidst the foul\nvapours of some subterranean dungeon?You little estimate my power, if\nyou know not that these and yet deeper modes of destruction stand\nat command of my art.But a physician slays not the patient by whose\ngenerosity he lives, and far less will he the breath of whose nostrils\nis the hope of revenge destroy the vowed ally who is to favour his\npursuit of it.Yet one word; should a necessity occur for rousing\nyourself--for who in Scotland can promise himself eight hours'\nuninterrupted repose?--then smell at the strong essence contained in\nthis pouncet box.And now, farewell, sir knight; and if you cannot think\nof me as a man of nice conscience, acknowledge me at least as one of\nreason and of judgment.\"So saying, the mediciner left the room, his usual mean and shuffling\ngait elevating itself into something more noble, as conscious of a\nvictory over his imperious patient.Sir John Ramorny remained sunk in unpleasing reflections until he began\nto experience the incipient effects of his soporific draught.He then\nroused himself for an instant, and summoned his page.I have done ill to unbosom myself so far to this\npoisonous quacksalver.\"Bonthron spoke apart with him, and followed him almost immediately--by\nyour lordship's command, as I understood him.\"he goes to seek some medicaments; he will return anon.If he be intoxicated, see he comes not near my chamber, and permit him\nnot to enter into converse with any one.He raves when drink has touched\nhis brain.He was a rare fellow before a Southron bill laid his brain\npan bare; but since that time he talks gibberish whenever the cup has\ncrossed his lips.Said the leech aught to you, Eviot?\"\"Nothing, save to reiterate his commands that your honour be not\ndisturbed.\"\"Which thou must surely obey,\" said the knight.\"I feel the summons to\nrest, of which I have been deprived since this unhappy wound.At least,\nif I have slept it has been but for a snatch.Aid me to take off my\ngown, Eviot.\"\"May God and the saints send you good rest, my lord,\" said the page,\nretiring after he had rendered his wounded master the assistance\nrequired.As Eviot left the room, the knight, whose brain was becoming more and\nmore confused, muttered over the page's departing salutation.\"God--saints--I have slept sound under such a benison.But now, methinks\nif I awake not to the accomplishment of my proud hopes of power and\nrevenge, the best wish for me is, that the slumbers which now fall\naround my head were the forerunners of that sleep which shall return\nmy borrowed powers to their original nonexistence--I can argue it no\nfarther.\"Thus speaking, he fell into a profound sleep.On Fastern's E'en when we war fou.The night which sunk down on the sickbed of Ramorny was not doomed to be\na quiet one.Two hours had passed since curfew bell, then rung at seven\no'clock at night, and in those primitive times all were retired to rest,\nexcepting such whom devotion, or duty, or debauchery made watchers; and\nthe evening being that of Shrovetide, or, as it was called in Scotland,\nFastern's E'en, the vigils of gaiety were by far the most frequented of\nthe three.The common people had, throughout the day, toiled and struggled at\nfootball; the nobles and gentry had fought cocks, and hearkened to the\nwanton music of the minstrel; while the citizens had gorged themselves\nupon pancakes fried in lard, and brose, or brewis--the fat broth, that\nis, in which salted beef had been boiled, poured upon highly toasted\noatmeal, a dish which even now is not ungrateful to simple, old\nfashioned Scottish palates.These were all exercises and festive dishes\nproper to the holiday.It was no less a solemnity of the evening that\nthe devout Catholic should drink as much good ale and wine as he had\nmeans to procure; and, if young and able, that he should dance at the\nring, or figure among the morrice dancers, who, in the city of Perth,\nas elsewhere, wore a peculiarly fantastic garb, and distinguished\nthemselves by their address and activity.All this gaiety took place\nunder the prudential consideration that the long term of Lent, now\napproaching, with its fasts and deprivations, rendered it wise for\nmortals to cram as much idle and sensual indulgence as they could into\nthe brief space which intervened before its commencement.The usual revels had taken place, and in most parts of the city were\nsucceeded by the usual pause.A particular degree of care had been\ntaken by the nobility to prevent any renewal of discord betwixt their\nfollowers and the citizens of the town, so that the revels had proceeded\nwith fewer casualties than usual, embracing only three deaths and\ncertain fractured limbs, which, occurring to individuals of little\nnote, were not accounted worth inquiring into.The carnival was closing\nquietly in general, but in some places the sport was still kept up.One company of revellers, who had been particularly noticed and\napplauded, seemed unwilling to conclude their frolic.The entry, as it\nwas called, consisted of thirteen persons, habited in the same manner,\nhaving doublets of chamois leather sitting close to their bodies,\ncuriously slashed and laced.They wore green caps with silver tassels,\nred ribands, and white shoes, had bells hung at their knees and around\ntheir ankles, and naked swords in their hands.This gallant party,\nhaving exhibited a sword dance before the King, with much clashing of\nweapons and fantastic interchange of postures, went on gallantly to\nrepeat their exhibition before the door of Simon Glover, where, having\nmade a fresh exhibition of their agility, they caused wine to be served\nround to their own company and the bystanders, and with a loud shout\ndrank to the health of the Fair Maid of Perth.This summoned old Simon\nto the door of his habitation, to acknowledge the courtesy of his\ncountrymen, and in his turn to send the wine around in honour of the\nMerry Morrice Dancers of Perth.\"We thank thee, father Simon,\" said a voice, which strove to drown in an\nartificial squeak the pert, conceited tone of Oliver Proudfute.\"But a\nsight of thy lovely daughter had been more sweet to us young bloods than\na whole vintage of Malvoisie.\"\"I thank thee, neighbours, for your goodwill,\" replied the glover.\"My\ndaughter is ill at ease, and may not come forth into the cold night air;\nbut if this gay gallant, whose voice methinks I should know, will go\ninto my poor house, she will charge him with thanks for the rest of\nyou.\"\"Bring them to us at the hostelrie of the Griffin,\" cried the rest of\nthe ballet to their favoured companion; \"for there will we ring in Lent,\nand have another rouse to the health of the lovely Catharine.\"\"Have with you in half an hour,\" said Oliver, \"and see who will quaff\nthe largest flagon, or sing the loudest glee.Nay, I will be merry in\nwhat remains of Fastern's Even, should Lent find me with my mouth closed\nfor ever.\"\"Farewell, then,\" cried his mates in the morrice--\"fare well, slashing\nbonnet maker, till we meet again.\"The morrice dancers accordingly set out upon their further progress,\ndancing and carolling as they went along to the sound of four musicians,\nwho led the joyous band, while Simon Glover drew their coryphaeus into\nhis house, and placed him in a chair by his parlour fire.\"She is the bait for us brave\nblades.\"\"Why, truly, she keeps her apartment, neighbour Oliver; and, to speak\nplainly, she keeps her bed.\"\"Why, then will I upstairs to see her in her sorrow; you have marred my\nramble, Gaffer Glover, and you owe me amends--a roving blade like me; I\nwill not lose both the lass and the glass.\"My dog and I we have a trick\n     To visit maids when they are sick;\n     When they are sick and like to die,\n     Oh, thither do come my dog and I.\"And when I die, as needs must hap,\n     Then bury me under the good ale tap;\n     With folded arms there let me lie\n     Cheek for jowl, my dog and I.\"\"Canst thou not be serious for a moment, neighbour Proudfute?\"said the\nglover; \"I want a word of conversation with you.\"answered his visitor; \"why, I have been serious all this\nday: I can hardly open my mouth, but something comes out about death, a\nburial, or suchlike--the most serious subjects that I wot of.\"said the glover, \"art then fey?\"\"No, not a whit: it is not my own death which these gloomy fancies\nforetell.I have a strong horoscope, and shall live for fifty years to\ncome.But it is the case of the poor fellow--the Douglas man, whom I\nstruck down at the fray of St.Valentine's: he died last night; it is\nthat which weighs on my conscience, and awakens sad fancies.Ah, father\nSimon, we martialists, that have spilt blood in our choler, have dark\nthoughts at times; I sometimes wish that my knife had cut nothing but\nworsted thrums.\"\"And I wish,\" said Simon, \"that mine had cut nothing but buck's leather,\nfor it has sometimes cut my own fingers.But thou mayst spare thy\nremorse for this bout: there was but one man dangerously hurt at the\naffray, and it was he from whom Henry Smith hewed the hand, and he is\nwell recovered.His name is Black Quentin, one of Sir John Ramorny's\nfollowers.He has been sent privately back to his own country of Fife.\"Why, that is the very man that Henry and I, as\nwe ever keep close together, struck at in the same moment, only my blow\nfell somewhat earlier.I fear further feud will come of it, and so does\nthe provost.Why, then, I will be jovial, and since\nthou wilt not let me see how Kate becomes her night gear, I will back to\nthe Griffin to my morrice dancers.\"Thou art a comrade of Henry Wynd, and hast\ndone him the service to own one or two deeds and this last among others.I would thou couldst clear him of other charges with which fame hath\nloaded him.\"\"Nay, I will swear by the hilt of my sword they are as false as hell,\nfather Simon.shall not men of the sword stick\ntogether?\"\"Nay, neighbour bonnet maker, be patient; thou mayst do the smith a kind\nturn, an thou takest this matter the right way.I have chosen thee to\nconsult with anent this matter--not that I hold thee the wisest head in\nPerth, for should I say so I should lie.\"\"Ay--ay,\" answered the self satisfied bonnet maker; \"I know where you\nthink my fault lies: you cool heads think we hot heads are fools--I have\nheard men call Henry Wynd such a score of times.\"\"Fool enough and cool enough may rhyme together passing well,\" said the\nglover; \"but thou art good natured, and I think lovest this crony of\nthine.It stands awkwardly with us and him just now,\" continued Simon.\"Thou knowest there hath been some talk of marriage between my daughter\nCatharine and Henry Gow?\"he that\nshall win the Fair Maid of Perth must be a happy man; and yet marriage\nspoils many a pretty fellow.I myself somewhat regret--\"\n\n\"Prithee, truce with thy regrets for the present, man,\" interrupted the\nglover, somewhat peevishly.\"You must know, Oliver, that some of these\ntalking women, who I think make all the business of the world their\nown, have accused Henry of keeping light company with glee women and\nsuchlike.Catharine took it to heart; and I held my child insulted, that\nhe had not waited upon her like a Valentine, but had thrown himself into\nunseemly society on the very day when, by ancient custom, he might have\nhad an opportunity to press his interest with my daughter.Therefore,\nwhen he came hither late on the evening of St.Valentine's, I, like a\nhasty old fool, bid him go home to the company he had left, and denied\nhim admittance.I have not seen him since, and I begin to think that\nI may have been too rash in the matter.She is my only child, and the\ngrave should have her sooner than a debauchee, But I have hitherto\nthought I knew Henry Gow as if he were my son.I cannot think he would\nuse us thus, and it may be there are means of explaining what is laid\nto his charge.I was led to ask Dwining, who is said to have saluted the\nsmith while he was walking with this choice mate.If I am to believe his\nwords, this wench was the smith's cousin, Joan Letham.But thou knowest\nthat the potter carrier ever speaks one language with his visage and\nanother with his tongue.Now, thou, Oliver, hast too little wit--I mean,\ntoo much honesty--to belie the truth, and as Dwining hinted that thou\nalso hadst seen her--\"\n\n\"I see her, Simon Glover!\"No, not precisely that; but he says you told him you had met the smith\nthus accompanied.\"\"He lies, and I will pound him into a gallipot!\"Did you never tell him, then, of such a meeting?\"\"Did not he swear that he\nwould never repeat again to living mortal what I communicated to him?and therefore, in telling the occurrent to you, he hath made himself a\nliar.\"\"Thou didst not meet the smith, then,\" said Simon, \"with such a loose\nbaggage as fame reports?\"\"Lackaday, not I; perhaps I did, perhaps I did not.Think, father\nSimon--I have been a four years married man, and can you expect me to\nremember the turn of a glee woman's ankle, the trip of her toe, the lace\nupon her petticoat, and such toys?No, I leave that to unmarried wags,\nlike my gossip Henry.\"\"The upshot is, then,\" said the glover, much vexed, \"you did meet him on\nSt.Valentine's Day walking the public streets--\"\n\n\"Not so, neighbour; I met him in the most distant and dark lane in\nPerth, steering full for his own house, with bag and baggage, which, as\na gallant fellow, he carried in his arms, the puppy dog on one and the\njilt herself--and to my thought she was a pretty one--hanging upon the\nother.\"John,\" said the glover, \"this infamy would make a\nChristian man renounce his faith, and worship Mahound in very anger!But\nhe has seen the last of my daughter.I would rather she went to the wild\nHighlands with a barelegged cateran than wed with one who could, at such\na season, so broadly forget honour and decency.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.father Simon,\" said the liberal minded bonnet maker, \"you\nconsider not the nature of young blood.Their company was not long,\nfor--to speak truth, I did keep a little watch on him--I met him before\nsunrise, conducting his errant damsel to the Lady's Stairs, that the\nwench might embark on the Tay from Perth; and I know for certainty, for\nI made inquiry, that she sailed in a gabbart for Dundee.So you see it\nwas but a slight escape of youth.\"\"And he came here,\" said Simon, bitterly, \"beseeching for admittance to\nmy daughter, while he had his harlot awaiting him at home!I had rather\nhe had slain a score of men!It skills not talking, least of all to\nthee, Oliver Proudfute, who, if thou art not such a one as himself,\nwould fain be thought so.But--\"\n\n\"Nay, think not of it so seriously,\" said Oliver, who began to reflect\non the mischief his tattling was likely to occasion to his friend, and\non the consequences of Henry Gow's displeasure, when he should learn\nthe disclosure which he had made rather in vanity of heart than in evil\nintention.\"Consider,\" he continued, \"that there are follies belonging to youth.Occasion provokes men to such frolics, and confession wipes them off.I\ncare not if I tell thee that, though my wife be as goodly", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "If thou must needs lie, which I think\nis thy nature, canst thou invent no falsehood that may at least do thee\nsome credit?<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.Do I not see through thee, as I could see the light through\nthe horn of a base lantern?Do I not know, thou filthy weaver of rotten\nworsted, that thou durst no more cross the threshold of thy own door, if\nthy wife heard of thy making such a boast, than thou darest cross naked\nweapons with a boy of twelve years old, who has drawn a sword for the\nfirst time of his life?John, it were paying you for your tale\nbearing trouble to send thy Maudie word of thy gay brags.\"The bonnet maker, at this threat, started as if a crossbow bolt had\nwhizzed past his head when least expected.And it was with a trembling\nvoice that he replied: \"Nay, good father Glover, thou takest too much\ncredit for thy grey hairs.Consider, good neighbour, thou art too old\nfor a young martialist to wrangle with.And in the matter of my Maudie,\nI can trust thee, for I know no one who would be less willing than thou\nto break the peace of families.\"\"Trust thy coxcomb no longer with me,\" said the incensed glover; \"but\ntake thyself, and the thing thou call'st a head, out of my reach, lest I\nborrow back five minutes of my youth and break thy pate!\"\"You have had a merry Fastern's Even, neighbour,\" said the bonnet maker,\n\"and I wish you a quiet sleep; we shall meet better friends tomorrow.\"\"I am ashamed so idle a\ntongue as thine should have power to move me thus.\"\"Idiot--beast--loose tongued coxcomb,\" he exclaimed, throwing himself\ninto a chair, as the bonnet maker disappeared; \"that a fellow made up\nof lies should not have had the grace to frame one when it might have\ncovered the shame of a friend!And I--what am I, that I should, in my\nsecret mind, wish that such a gross insult to me and my child had\nbeen glossed over?Yet such was my opinion of Henry, that I would have\nwillingly believed the grossest figment the swaggering ass could have\ninvented.Our honest name must be\nmaintained, though everything else should go to ruin.\"While the glover thus moralised on the unwelcome confirmation of the\ntale he wished to think untrue, the expelled morrice dancer had leisure,\nin the composing air of a cool and dark February night, to meditate on\nthe consequences of the glover's unrestrained anger.\"But it is nothing,\" he bethought himself, \"to the wrath of Henry Wynd,\nwho hath killed a man for much less than placing displeasure betwixt him\nand Catharine, as well as her fiery old father.But the humour of seeming a knowing gallant, as\nin truth I am, fairly overcame me.Were I best go to finish the revel\nat the Griffin?But then Maudie will rampauge on my return--ay, and this\nbeing holiday even, I may claim a privilege.I have it: I will not to\nthe Griffin--I will to the smith's, who must be at home, since no one\nhath seen him this day amid the revel.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.I will endeavour to make peace\nwith him, and offer my intercession with the glover.Harry is a simple,\ndownright fellow, and though I think he is my better in a broil, yet\nin discourse I can turn him my own way.The streets are now quiet, the\nnight, too, is dark, and I may step aside if I meet any rioters.I will\nto the smith's, and, securing him for my friend, I care little for old\nSimon.Ringan bear me well through this night, and I will clip my\ntongue out ere it shall run my head into such peril again!Yonder old\nfellow, when his blood was up, looked more like a carver of buff jerkins\nthan a clipper of kid gloves.\"With these reflections, the puissant Oliver walked swiftly, yet with as\nlittle noise as possible, towards the wynd in which the smith, as our\nreaders are aware, had his habitation.But his evil fortune had not\nceased to pursue him.As he turned into the High, or principal, Street,\nhe heard a burst of music very near him, followed by a loud shout.\"My merry mates, the morrice dancers,\" thought he; \"I would know old\nJeremy's rebeck among an hundred.I will venture across the street ere\nthey pass on; if I am espied, I shall have the renown of some private\nquest, which may do me honour as a roving blade.\"With these longings for distinction among the gay and gallant, combated,\nhowever, internally, by more prudential considerations, the bonnet maker\nmade an attempt to cross the street.But the revellers, whoever they\nmight be, were accompanied by torches, the flash of which fell upon\nOliver, whose light  habit made him the more distinctly visible.The general shout of \"A prize--a prize\" overcame the noise of the\nminstrel, and before the bonnet maker could determine whether it were\nbetter to stand or fly, two active young men, clad in fantastic masking\nhabits, resembling wild men, and holding great clubs, seized upon him,\nsaying, in a tragical tone: \"Yield thee, man of bells and bombast--yield\nthee, rescue or no rescue, or truly thou art but a dead morrice dancer.\"said the bonnet maker, with a faltering\nvoice; for, though he saw he had to do with a party of mummers who were\nafoot for pleasure, yet he observed at the same time that they were far\nabove his class, and he lost the audacity necessary to support his part\nin a game where the inferior was likely to come by the worst.answered one of the maskers; \"and must I\nshow thee that thou art a captive, by giving thee incontinently the\nbastinado?\"\"By no means, puissant man of Ind,\" said the bonnet maker; \"lo, I am\nconformable to your pleasure.\"\"Come, then,\" said those who had arrested him--\"come and do homage\nto the Emperor of Mimes, King of Caperers, and Grand Duke of the Dark\nHours, and explain by what right thou art so presumptuous as to prance\nand jingle, and wear out shoe leather, within his dominions without\npaying him tribute.Know'st thou not thou hast incurred the pains of\nhigh treason?\"\"That were hard, methinks,\" said poor Oliver, \"since I knew not that his\nGrace exercised the government this evening.But I am willing to redeem\nthe forfeit, if the purse of a poor bonnet maker may, by the mulct of a\ngallon of wine, or some such matter.\"\"Bring him before the emperor,\" was the universal cry; and the morrice\ndancer was placed before a slight, but easy and handsome, figure of a\nyoung man, splendidly attired, having a cincture and tiara of peacock's\nfeathers, then brought from the East as a marvellous rarity; a short\njacket and under dress of leopard's skin fitted closely the rest of his\nperson, which was attired in flesh  silk, so as to resemble the\nordinary idea of an Indian prince.He wore sandals, fastened on with\nribands of scarlet silk, and held in his hand a sort of fan, such as\nladies then used, composed of the same feathers, assembled into a plume\nor tuft.\"What mister wight have we here,\" said the Indian chief, \"who dares to\ntie the bells of a morrice on the ankles of a dull ass?Hark ye, friend,\nyour dress should make you a subject of ours, since our empire extends\nover all Merryland, including mimes and minstrels of every description.He lacks wine; minister to him our nutshell full of\nsack.\"A huge calabash full of sack was offered to the lips of the supplicant,\nwhile this prince of revellers exhorted him:\n\n\"Crack me this nut, and do it handsomely, and without wry faces.\"But, however Oliver might have relished a moderate sip of the same good\nwine, he was terrified at the quantity he was required to deal with.He\ndrank a draught, and then entreated for mercy.\"So please your princedom, I have yet far to go, and if I were to\nswallow your Grace's bounty, for which accept my dutiful thanks, I\nshould not be able to stride over the next kennel.\"\"Art thou in case to bear thyself like a galliard?Now, cut me a\ncaper--ha!one--two--three--admirable.Again--give him the spur (here a\nsatellite of the Indian gave Oliver a slight touch with his sword).Nay,\nthat is best of all: he sprang like a cat in a gutter.Tender him the\nnut once more; nay, no compulsion, he has paid forfeit, and deserves not\nonly free dismissal but reward.Kneel down--kneel, and arise Sir Knight\nof the Calabash!And one of you lend me a rapier.\"\"Oliver, may it please your honour--I mean your principality.\"Nay, then thou art one of the 'douze peers' already, and\nfate has forestalled our intended promotion.Yet rise up, sweet Sir\nOliver Thatchpate, Knight of the honourable order of the Pumpkin--rise\nup, in the name of nonsense, and begone about thine own concerns, and\nthe devil go with thee!\"So saying, the prince of the revels bestowed a smart blow with the flat\nof the weapon across the bonnet maker's shoulders, who sprung to his\nfeet with more alacrity of motion than he had hitherto displayed, and,\naccelerated by the laugh and halloo which arose behind him, arrived at\nthe smith's house before he stopped, with the same speed with which a\nhunted fox makes for his den.It was not till the affrighted bonnet maker had struck a blow on the\ndoor that he recollected he ought to have bethought himself beforehand\nin what manner he was to present himself before Henry, and obtain his\nforgiveness for his rash communications to Simon Glover.No one answered\nto his first knock, and, perhaps, as these reflections arose in the\nmomentary pause of recollection which circumstances permitted, the\nperplexed bonnet maker might have flinched from his purpose, and made\nhis retreat to his own premises, without venturing upon the interview\nwhich he had purposed.But a distant strain of minstrelsy revived his\napprehensions of falling once more into the hands of the gay maskers\nfrom whom he had escaped, and he renewed his summons on the door of the\nsmith's dwelling with a hurried, though faltering, hand.He was then\nappalled by the deep, yet not unmusical, voice of Henry Gow, who\nanswered from within: \"Who calls at this hour, and what is it that you\nwant?\"\"It is I--Oliver Proudfute,\" replied the bonnet maker; \"I have a merry\njest to tell you, gossip Henry.\"\"Carry thy foolery to some other market.I am in no jesting humour,\"\nsaid Henry.\"Go hence; I will see no one tonight.\"\"But, gossip--good gossip,\" answered the martialist with out, \"I am\nbeset with villains, and beg the shelter of your roof!\"replied Henry; \"no dunghill cock, the most\nrecreant that has fought this Fastern's Eve, would ruffle his feathers\nat such a craven as thou!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.At this moment another strain of minstrelsy, and, as the bonnet maker\nconceited, one which approached much nearer, goaded his apprehensions\nto the uttermost; and in a voice the tones of which expressed the\nundisguised extremity of instant fear he exclaimed:\n\n\"For the sake of our old gossipred, and for the love of Our Blessed\nLady, admit me, Henry, if you would not have me found a bloody corpse at\nthy door, slain by the bloody minded Douglasses!\"\"That would be a shame to me,\" thought the good natured smith, \"and\nsooth to say, his peril may be real.There are roving hawks that will\nstrike at a sparrow as soon as a heron.\"With these reflections, half muttered, half spoken, Henry undid his well\nfastened door, proposing to reconnoitre the reality of the danger before\nhe permitted his unwelcome guest to enter the house.But as he looked\nabroad to ascertain how matters stood, Oliver bolted in like a scared\ndeer into a thicket, and harboured himself by the smith's kitchen fire\nbefore Henry could look up and down the lane, and satisfy himself there\nwere no enemies in pursuit of the apprehensive fugitive.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.He secured his\ndoor, therefore, and returned into the kitchen, displeased that he had\nsuffered his gloomy solitude to be intruded upon by sympathising with\napprehensions which he thought he might have known were so easily\nexcited as those of his timid townsman.he said, coldly enough, when he saw the bonnet maker calmly\nseated by his hearth.I see\nno one near to harm you.\"\"Give me a drink, kind gossip,\" said Oliver: \"I am choked with the haste\nI have made to come hither.\"\"I have sworn,\" said Henry, \"that this shall be no revel night in this\nhouse: I am in my workday clothes, as you see, and keep fast, as I have\nreason, instead of holiday.You have had wassail enough for the holiday\nevening, for you speak thick already.If you wish more ale or wine you\nmust go elsewhere.\"\"I have had overmuch wassail already,\" said poor Oliver, \"and have been\nwell nigh drowned in it.A draught of water,\nkind gossip--you will not surely let me ask for that in vain?or, if it\nis your will, a cup of cold small ale.\"\"Nay, if that be all,\" said Henry, \"it shall not be lacking.But it must\nhave been much which brought thee to the pass of asking for either.\"So saying, he filled a quart flagon from a barrel that stood nigh, and\npresented it to his guest.Oliver eagerly accepted it, raised it to\nhis head with a trembling hand, imbibed the contents with lips which\nquivered with emotion, and, though the potation was as thin as he had\nrequested, so much was he exhausted with the combined fears of alarm and\nof former revelry, that, when he placed the flagon on the oak table, he\nuttered a deep sigh of satisfaction, and remained silent.\"Well, now you have had your draught, gossip,\" said the smith, \"what is\nit you want?\"No--but there were twenty chased me into the wynd,\" said Oliver.\"But\nwhen they saw us together, you know they lost the courage that brought\nall of them upon one of us.\"\"Nay, do not trifle, friend Oliver,\" replied his host; \"my mood lies not\nthat way.\"I have been stayed and foully\noutraged (gliding his hand sensitively over the place affected) by mad\nDavid of Rothsay, roaring Ramorny, and the rest of them.They made me\ndrink a firkin of Malvoisie.\"Ramorny is sick nigh to death, as the potter\ncarrier everywhere reports: they and he cannot surely rise at midnight\nto do such frolics.\"\"I cannot tell,\" replied Oliver; \"but I saw the party by torchlight,\nand I can make bodily oath to the bonnets I made for them since last\nInnocents'.They are of a quaint device, and I should know my own\nstitch.\"\"Well, thou mayst have had wrong,\" answered Henry.\"If thou art in real\ndanger, I will cause them get a bed for thee here.But you must fill it\npresently, for I am not in the humour of talking.\"\"Nay, I would thank thee for my quarters for a night, only my Maudie\nwill be angry--that is, not angry, for that I care not for--but the\ntruth is, she is overanxious on a revel night like this, knowing my\nhumour is like thine for a word and a blow.\"\"Why, then, go home,\" said the smith, \"and show her that her treasure is\nin safety, Master Oliver; the streets are quiet, and, to speak a blunt\nword, I would be alone.\"\"Nay, but I have things to speak with thee about of moment,\" replied\nOliver, who, afraid to stay, seemed yet unwilling to go.\"There has been\na stir in our city council about the affair of St.The\nprovost told me not four hours since, that the Douglas and he had agreed\nthat the feud should be decided by a yeoman on either party and that our\nacquaintance, the Devil's Dick, was to wave his gentry, and take up the\ncause for Douglas and the nobles, and that you or I should fight for the\nFair City.Now, though I am the elder burgess, yet I am willing, for the\nlove and kindness we have always borne to each other, to give thee the\nprecedence, and content myself with the humbler office of stickler.\"Henry Smith, though angry, could scarce forbear a smile.\"If it is that which breaks thy quiet, and keeps thee out of thy bed at\nmidnight, I will make the matter easy.Thou shalt not lose the advantage\noffered thee.I have fought a score of duels--far, far too many.Thou hast, I think, only encountered with thy wooden soldan: it were\nunjust--unfair--unkind--in me to abuse thy friendly offer.So go home,\ngood fellow, and let not the fear of losing honour disturb thy slumbers.Rest assured that thou shalt answer the challenge, as good right thou\nhast, having had injury from this rough rider.\"\"Gramercy, and thank thee kindly,\" said Oliver much embarrassed by his\nfriend's unexpected deference; \"thou art the good friend I have always\nthought thee.But I have as much friendship for Henry Smith as he for\nOliver Proudfute.John, I will not fight in this\nquarrel to thy prejudice; so, having said so, I am beyond the reach of\ntemptation, since thou wouldst not have me mansworn, though it were to\nfight twenty duels.\"\"Hark thee,\" said the smith, \"acknowledge thou art afraid, Oliver: tell\nthe honest truth, at once, otherwise I leave thee to make the best of\nthy quarrel.\"\"Nay, good gossip,\" replied the bonnet maker, \"thou knowest I am never\nafraid.In\nmy room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for a day, I put the cage containing my\nlittle friend into one of these drawers, lest any one should attempt to\nmeddle with it during my absence.On returning, I opened the drawer,\nand just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my\npoor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up\nhis body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to\nanimation.His little body had been crushed\nin the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been\nendeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *\n\nNOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers\nas may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little\nanimals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage\nout daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in\nwinter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the\nmice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as\ntoo moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to\nproduce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with\nimpunity.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat\nor barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little\ntin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely\nfixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,\nor too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves\nbetween them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals\nare fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,\nwould quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the\nbird-shops in Patrick\u2019s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage\nmakers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,\nwhose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about\nKnightsbridge.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence\nper pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would\nall utter the one cry, \u201cwe are overstocked;\u201d and echo would reply\n\u201coverstocked.\u201d This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody\nseems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own\npart--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is\nloudest in exclaiming \u201cdear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep\nhere!\u201d never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own\nperson from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from\nthe utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already\nin the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many \u201cvanities and vexations of spirit\u201d under the sun, but this\nevil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to\nno purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the \u201cexcess\u201d\nfrom applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are\nthe primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the\nloss.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be\nowing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it\nstrikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people\npay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of\nblanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;\nbut in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is\nnothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the\nenvy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared\nwith the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to\nenjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a\nprovision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general\neducation, professional education, and then of admission to \u201cliberty to\npractise;\u201d and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,\nthey conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost\nthem \u201cthus much monies.\u201d But unfortunately they soon learn by experience\nthat the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always\npossess that homely recommendation of causing the \u201cpot to boil,\u201d and that\nthe individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so\nsoon left to shift for himself.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.Here then is another cause of this evil,\nnamely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a\ncertain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these \u201cpiping\ntimes of peace,\u201d a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to\nverify the old song, and\n\n    \u201cSpend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,\u201d\n\nas an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation\nmonies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et\nceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any\ncomfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other\nsource, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the\nhands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,\nand of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by\ncircumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.Yet the\nmistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently\nadmitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual\nresult is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,\nafter incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is\nobliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the\nunprofitable profession of arms.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk there.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other\nprofessions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of\nthe bar, that \u201cmany are called but few are chosen;\u201d but with very few and\nrare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however\nsmall, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and\nconnections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his\nmind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from\nday to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,\nwithout any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast\nproportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so\nconstantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the football.The question\nis, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an\noverstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to\nenter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no\nunnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty\u2019s\nsubjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain\nsituations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable\nchannels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal\nprofession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can\nafford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to\nbear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such\nit is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they\nthink proper.But it will be asked, what is to\nbe done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,\nif this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably\nspent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive\npursuits, would insure them a \u201cgood location\u201d and a certain provision\nfor life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable\noccupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to\n\u201cprofessions\u201d which, however \u201cliberal,\u201d hold out to the many but a very\ndoubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among\ncertain of my countrymen that \u201ctrade\u201d is not a \u201cgenteel\u201d thing, and\nthat it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes\nalso, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of\nwhich we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high\nclassical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our\nschools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a\nmatter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,\nas surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.Thus the evil is\nnourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising\nthose parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in\nthe professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their\nchildren, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less\nelegant but more useful accomplishment of \u201cciphering.\u201d I am disposed to\nconcur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the\ninestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,\nin our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every\nthing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly\nrecommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is\nno encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there\nwere, there would be no necessity for me to recommend \u201cciphering\u201d and\nits virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers\nits prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who\nwait for a \u201chighway\u201d to be made for them.If people were resolved to\nlive by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,\nthan at present operate successfully in that department.If more of\neducation, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources\nof profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover\nthemselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter\nfurther into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint\nwhich may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small\nfarmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it\nis.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to\nChristmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to\nwhich they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear\nto offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and\naccommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of\npoultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to\nthe rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor\nIrish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth\nwhile to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having\nascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great\ndecrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one\nindividual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas\nand Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that\nanother dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as\nmany: these they purchase in lots from the farmers\u2019 wives.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to\nsome of the readers of this Journal:--\n\nThe farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent\nof suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the\nfertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a\nhigher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number\nof goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all\ncasualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on\nwhich, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,\nas it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;\nand this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with\nstimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,\ntwenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after\nbringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the\nbirds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three\nshillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,\non which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,\ngenerally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or\nlarger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in\norder to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if\nwith reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be\nsuperfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various\nworks on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the\npractice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great\ndealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,\nand condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio\nof one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to\ncleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened\nin about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,\ndescribed by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of\nblinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated\ncasks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),\nare happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,\nwith one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal\nproofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese\nbrought into", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets\nof barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their\ngeese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,\nbesides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and\nrather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the\nvast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year\nfor the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which\ngives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this\nbusiness, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural\ncountrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the\nstock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,\nand in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or\nfeed on the stubbles.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be\nless frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when\nthe geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the\ncramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This\nopinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which\nleads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when\nthey are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,\nand that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give\nthem, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of\ncondition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.Mr Cobbett\nused to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,\ncarrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as\nfarinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience\nof such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory\nand conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of\npotatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not\nif it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of\ncramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general\ndisinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese\nalive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three\ntimes in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation\ntwice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,\nthe geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the\nbirds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the\npluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.But as birds do not moult three\ntimes in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said\nthat the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature\nsuggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great\nnumbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground\nwould be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be\njustified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,\nwe have many recorded facts; among them the following:--\u201cIn 1824 there\nwas a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near\nMarket Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It\nhad been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson\u2019s\nforefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer\nit to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the\nin-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on\nthe spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.\u201d\n\nThe taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a\ngoose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause\nits enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high\nand forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well\nknown; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in\nproducing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for\ngeese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it\nwould appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but\nin another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--\u201cThe production of\nflesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for\nexample, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the\nactivity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed\ninto fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress\nof respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions\nnecessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in\nquadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an\nexcessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of\nthe animal.\u201d\n\nWe are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for\nthe market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of\ngeese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be\nthe chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many\nparts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our\nagricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese\nin localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of\nconversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the\npublic mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also\nhope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish\nmanufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to\nthose of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be\ndeemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;\nand, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce\nfor themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get \u201cthe London\nstamp\u201d upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the\ncase of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures\nare rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to\nour knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually\nat the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many\nof those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into\n\u201cOuld Ireland,\u201d and are bought as English by those who would despise\nthem as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in\nthis way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and\nin like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,\nwithout waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity\nfor such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists\nequally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so\nhighly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them\nby wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the\nfavour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we\nmay refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor\nhas been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of\n_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled \u201cA\nshort chapter on Bustles,\u201d but which he gives as written for the said\nCourt Gazette!<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the

better again, we find our able and\nkind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no\ndoubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks\nago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,\nbut as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court\nGazette.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to\nconsider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own\nJournal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the\nconsistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the\ncause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be\ncompatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football there.*       *       *       *       *\n\n    Printed and published every Saturday by GUNN and CAMERON, at\n    the Office of

love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me\nin the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee\npresume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short\ndiscourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,\nI must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee\nthankful.\"That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the\npower of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage\nexceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the\nmost manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and\nhis sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,\nbeing but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose\ncompassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause\nto respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim\nattendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I\ncannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of\nthose my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After\nsome six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of\nmy execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save\nmine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was\nsafely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty\nmiserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those\nlarge territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore\nCommonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved.\"And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by\nthis Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant\nFortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not\nspare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,\nand our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to\nimploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or\nher extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am\nsure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought\nto surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not\naffright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered\neies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:\nwhich had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild\ntraine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during\nthe time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the\ninstrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter\nconfusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia\nmight have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since\nthen, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents\nfrom that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and\ntroublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our\nColonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,\nthe Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last\nrejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,\nwith whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of\nthat Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe\nin mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly\nconsidered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding.\"Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your\nbest leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done\nin the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented\nyou from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet\nI never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of\nabilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,\nher birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly\nto beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be\nfrom one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's\nestate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most\nand least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried\nit as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her\nstation: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome\nmay rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and\nChristianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all\nthis good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should\ndoe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to\nyour servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare\nher dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest\nsubjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious\nhands.\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.The passage in this letter, \"She hazarded the beating out of her owne\nbraines to save mine,\" is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the\nparagraph which speaks of \"the exceeding great courtesie\" of Powhatan;\nand Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up\nhis\n\n\"General Historie.\"Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the\nfirst three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to\nNew England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the\nservice she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect\nof the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there\nSmith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only\none we have, must be given for what it is worth.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.According to this she\nhad supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He\nwrites:\n\n\"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured\nher face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband\nwith divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself\nto have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to\ntalke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You\ndid promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to\nyou; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the\nsame reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I\ndurst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.With\na well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my\nfather's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and\nfear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and\nyou shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your\ncontrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other\ntill I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek\nyou, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much.\"'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by\nPowhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they\nand their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make\nnotches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that\ntask.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him\nto show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had\ntold so much.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had\nheard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably\nnot coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was\nconvinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: \"You gave\nPowhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave\nme nothing, and I am better than your white dog.\"Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and \"they\ndid think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen\nmany English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;\" and\nhe heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,\nas also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both\nat the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but\nthe contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of\ncuriosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,\nand the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's \"Christmas his Mask\" at court, January\n6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain\nwrites to Carleton: \"The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father\ncounsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and\nher assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though\nsore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away.\"Neill says that \"after the first weeks of her residence in England\nshe does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter\nwriters,\" and the Rev.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.Peter Fontaine says that \"when they heard that\nRolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he\nhad not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian\nprincesse.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.His interest in the colony was never\nthe most intelligent, and apt

these toys.\"There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a\nportrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is\ntranslated: \"Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,\nEmperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died\non shipboard at Gravesend 1617.\"This is doubtless the portrait engraved\nby Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the\nLondon edition of the \"General Historie,\" 1624.It is not probable that\nthe portrait was originally published with the \"General Historie.\"The\nportrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:\n\nRound the portrait:\n\n\"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.In

brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably\non the 21st of March, 1617.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.I have seen somewhere a statement, which\nI cannot confirm, that her

London,\" that her death occurred March\n21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became\nGovernor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that\nunscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the\ncompany.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: \"We cannot\nimagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives\nhave

Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas\nto the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil\npractices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle\nHenry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned\nto Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his\napplication to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the\nIndian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only\ndaughter who was married, says Stith (1753), \"to Col.John Bolling; by\nwhom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father\nto the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to\nCol.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.Campbell in his \"History of Virginia\"\nsays that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an\nesteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,\ngrandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the\ngreat granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with\nfighting and the savage delights of life.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.He had many names and titles;\nhis own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,\nand usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and\nconquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not\ndefined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the\nPotomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he\nalternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of\nwhich at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey\n(York) River.He is said\nto have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the\nyoungest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his\nharem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into\nall his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to\nselect.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:\n\"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold\nand stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes\nand attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is\nsupposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how\nmuch more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a\nsad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,\nhanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so\non his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,\nvigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath\nbeen, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and\nthat to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,\nas also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in\nsecurity and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions\nof peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is\nlikewise more quietly settled amongst his own.\"It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives\nwhom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,\npresenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,\nor tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on\nburning coals.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put\non such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to\nthe necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: \"Such is (I believe)\nthe impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other\nheathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the\nknowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an\ninfused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall\nbe so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on\nearth.\"Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the\nappearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed\nby Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or\nconjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept\nand conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but\npropitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception\nof an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a\nceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,\nalthough Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians \"naked slaves of the\ndevil,\" also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes\ntheir own children.An image of their god which he sent to England\n\"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed\nmonster.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.And he adds: \"Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are\nno other but such as our English witches are.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.This notion I believe\nalso pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief\nthat the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a\nwell-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the\nbetter effect of the invocations of the whites.In \"Winslow's Relation,\"\nquoted by Alexander Young in his \"Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,\"\nunder date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought\na fast day was appointed.Before they broke up, owing to\nprayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: \"showing the\ndifference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name\nof God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as\nsometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the\nground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never\nobserved the like.\"It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of\nthose in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they\ngot a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth\nand the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either\naccording to the custom of the country or as a defense against the\nstinging of mosquitoes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.The women are of the same hue as the men, says\nStrachey; \"howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so\ndiscolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth\nhow they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the\nwomen,\" \"dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming\nit the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden\nquince is of,\" as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient\nBritain women dyed themselves with red; \"howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]\nhe or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this\ncollour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not\nyet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their\noyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly\ncommunicate the secret and teach it one another.\"Thomas Lechford in his \"Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,\"\nLondon, 1642, says: \"They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their\nchildren are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors\npresently.\"The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no\nbeards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at\nthe end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as\nthe Moors; and the women as having \"handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty\nhands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as\nbarbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an\nell long.\"A Puritan divine--\"New England's Plantation, 1630\"--says of\nthe Indians about him, \"their hair is generally black, and cut before\nlike our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to\nour gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England.\"Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from\nStrachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:\n\n\"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in\nthe same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white\nbone or shreeds of copper, beaten thin", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke\nto the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these\nholes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard\nin length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes\nfamiliarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt\ntyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums.\"This is the earliest use I find of our word \"conundrum,\" and the sense\nit bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves\nhis prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight\nagainst the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for\nthe crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is\nsomething pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death\nof his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun\nby the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege\nof moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him\npeace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, \"tender and true.\"Wanting apparently the\ncruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the\nheart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle\nwords for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of\na gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has\nwoven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later\nwriters have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts\nthat industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and\nunrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters\nin her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the\nappearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so\ninclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt\nto learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those\nwho taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,\nsensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something\nmore than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger\nand a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who\nopposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in\ncivilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight\nof a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural\nto a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than\nefforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the\nwhites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the\nsupport of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on\nsight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed\nwhites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a\nbase violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to\nher situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her\ncaptors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,\nthat her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always\nremains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained\nby the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her\nadopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian\nname she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than\nshe left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre\nof 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she\nmight have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles\nof the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying\nwhen she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all\nhistory, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose\nempire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except\nthe remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.These caverns had been and\nstill were found to be most convenient and useful for the purpose of\nwhisky-runners and of cattle-rustlers, affording safe hiding-places for\nthemselves and their spoil.With this trail and all its ramifications\nJerry was thoroughly familiar.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.The only other man in the Force who\nknew it better than Jerry was Cameron himself.For many months he had\npatroled the main trail and all its cross leaders, lived in its caves\nand explored its caverns in pursuit of those interesting gentlemen whose\nactivities more than anything else had rendered necessary the existence\nof the North West Mounted Police.In ancient times the caves along the\nSun Dance Trail had been used by the Indian Medicine-Men for their pagan\nrites, and hence in the eyes of the Indians to these caves attached a\ndreadful reverence that made them places to be avoided in recent years\nby the various tribes now gathered on the reserves.But during these\nlast months of unrest it was suspected by the Police that the ancient\nuses of these caves had been revived and that the rites long since\nfallen into desuetude were once more being practised.For the first few miles of the canyon the trail offered good footing\nand easy going, but as the gorge deepened and narrowed the difficulties\nincreased until riding became impossible, and only by the most strenuous\nefforts on the part of both men and beasts could any advance be made.And so through the day and into the late evening they toiled on, ever\nalert for sight or sound of the Piegan band.\"We are making no time and we may spoil\nthings.\"Me too,\" grunted Jerry, who was as tired as his wiry frame ever allowed\nhim to become.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.They took a trail leading eastward, which to all eyes but those familiar\nwith it would have been invisible, for a hundred yards or so and came\nto the bed of a dry stream which issued from between two great rocks.Behind one of these rocks there opened out a grassy plot a few yards\nsquare, and beyond the grass a little lifted platform of rock against a\nsheer cliff.Here they camped, picketing their horses on the grass and\ncooking their supper upon the platform of rock over a tiny fire of dry\ntwigs, for the wind was blowing down the canyon and they knew that they\ncould cook their meal and have their smoke without fear of detection.For some time after supper they sat smoking in that absolute silence\nwhich is the characteristic of the true man of the woods.The gentle\nbreeze blowing down the canyon brought to their ears the rustling of\nthe dry poplar-leaves and the faint murmur of the stream which, tumbling\ndown the canyon, accompanied the main trail a hundred yards away.Suddenly Cameron's hand fell upon the knee of the half-breed with a\nswift grip.With mouths slightly open and with hands to their ears they both sat\nmotionless, breathless, every nerve on strain.Gradually the dead\nsilence seemed to resolve itself into rhythmic waves of motion rather\nthan of sound--\"TUM-ta-ta-TUM.It was\nthe throb of the Indian medicine-drum, which once heard can never be\nforgotten or mistaken.Without a word to each other they rose, doused\ntheir fire, cached their saddles, blankets and grub, and, taking only\ntheir revolvers, set off up the canyon.Before they had gone many yards\nCameron halted.\"I take it they have come in the\nback way over the old Porcupine Trail.\"\"Then we can go in from the canyon.It is hard going, but there is less\nfear of detection.They are sure to be in the Big Wigwam.\"Jerry shook his head, with a puzzled look on his face.Steadily the throb of the medicine-drum grew more distinct as they moved\nslowly up the canyon, rising and falling upon the breeze that came down\nthrough the darkness to meet them.The trail, which was bad enough in\nthe light, became exceedingly dangerous and difficult in the blackness\nof the night.On they struggled painfully, now clinging to the sides of\nthe gorge, now mounting up over a hill and again descending to the level\nof the foaming stream.\"Will they have sentries out, I wonder?\"whispered Cameron in Jerry's\near.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.\"No--beeg medicine going on--no sentry.\"\"All right, then, we will walk straight in on them.\"\"We will see what they are doing and send them about their business,\"\nsaid Cameron shortly.\"S'pose Indian mak beeg medicine--bes' leave\nhim go till morning.\"\"Well, Jerry, we will take a look at them at any rate,\" said Cameron.\"But if they are fooling around with any rebellion nonsense I am going\nto step in and stop it.\"\"Beeg medicine mak' Indian man\ncrazy--fool--dance--sing--mak' brave--then keel--queeck!\"\"Come along, then, Jerry,\" said Cameron impatiently.The throb of the drum grew clearer until it seemed that the next turn in\nthe trail should reveal the camp, while with the drum throb they began\nto catch, at first faintly and then more clearly, the monotonous chant\n\"Hai-yai-kai-yai, Hai-yai-kai-yai,\" that ever accompanies the Indian\ndance.Suddenly the drums ceased altogether and with it the chanting,\nand then there arose upon the night silence a low moaning cry that\ngradually rose into a long-drawn penetrating wail, almost a scream, made\nby a single voice.Jerry's hand caught Cameron's arm with a convulsive grip.\"Sioux Indian--he mak' dat when he go keel.\"Once more the long weird wailing scream pierced the night and, echoing\ndown the canyon, was repeated a hundred times by the black rocky sides.Cameron could feel Jerry's hand still quivering on his arm.\"Me hear dat when A'm small boy--me.\"Then Cameron remembered that it was Sioux blood that  the\nlife-stream in Jerry's veins.But he was\nmore shaken than he cared to acknowledge by that weird unearthly cry\nand by its all too obvious effect upon the iron nerves of that little\nhalf-breed at his side.\"Dey mak' dat cry when dey go meet Custer long 'go,\" said Jerry, making\nno motion to go forward.\"Come along, unless\nyou want to go back.\"His words stung the half-breed into action.Cameron could feel him in\nthe dark jerk his hand away and hear him grit his teeth.\"Now we will look in upon\nthese fire-eaters.\"Sharp to the right they turned behind a cliff, and then back almost upon\ntheir trail, still to the right, through a screen of spruce and poplar,\nand found themselves in a hole of a rock that lengthened into a tunnel\nblacker than the night outside.Pursuing this tunnel some little\ndistance they became aware of a light that grew as they moved toward\nit into a fire set in the middle of a wide cavern.The cavern was of\nirregular shape, with high-vaulted roof, open to the sky at the apex and\nhung with glistening stalactites.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.The floor of this cavern lay slightly\nbelow them, and from their position they could command a full view of\nits interior.The sides of the cavern round about were crowded with tawny faces of\nIndians arranged rank upon rank, the first row seated upon the ground,\nthose behind crouching upon their haunches, those still farther back\nstanding.In the center of the cavern and with his face lit by the fire\nstood the Sioux Chief, Onawata.\"He mak' beeg spik,\" he said.\"He say Indian long tam' 'go have all country when his fadder small boy.Dem day good hunting--plenty beaver, mink, moose, buffalo like leaf on\ntree, plenty hit (eat), warm wigwam, Indian no seeck, notting wrong.Dem\nday Indian lak' deer go every place.Dem day Indian man lak' bear 'fraid\nnotting.Good tam', happy, hunt deer, keel buffalo, hit all day.The half-breed's voice faded in two long gasps.The Sioux's chanting voice rose and fell through the vaulted cavern like\na mighty instrument of music.His audience of crowding Indians gazed\nin solemn rapt awe upon him.The whole circle\nswayed in unison with his swaying form as he chanted the departed\nglories of those happy days when the red man roamed free those plains\nand woods, lord of his destiny and subject only to his own will.The\nmystic magic power of that rich resonant voice, its rhythmic cadence\nemphasized by the soft throbbing of the drum, the uplifted face glowing\nas with prophetic fire, the tall swaying form instinct with exalted\nemotion, swept the souls of his hearers with surging tides of passion.Cameron, though he caught but little of its meaning, felt himself\nirresistibly borne along upon the torrent of the flowing words.He\nglanced at Jerry beside him and was startled by the intense emotion\nshowing upon his little wizened face.Suddenly there was a swift change of motif, and with it a change of\ntone and movement and color.The marching, vibrant, triumphant chant\nof freedom and of conquest subsided again into the long-drawn wail of\ndefeat, gloom and despair.He knew the\nsinger was telling the pathetic story of the passing of the day of the\nIndian's glory and the advent of the day of his humiliation.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football there.With sharp\nrising inflections, with staccato phrasing and with fierce passionate\nintonation, the Sioux wrung the hearts of his hearers.Again Cameron\nglanced at the half-breed at his side and again he was startled to note\nthe transformation in his face.Where there had been glowing pride there\nwas now bitter savage hate.For that hour at least the half-breed was\nall Sioux.His father's blood was the water in his veins, the red was\nonly his Indian mother's.With face drawn tense and lips bared into\na snarl, with eyes gleaming, he gazed fascinated upon the face of the\nsinger.In imagination, in instinct, in the deepest emotions of his soul\nJerry was harking back again to the savage in him, and the savage in him\nthirsting for revenge upon the white man who had wrought this ruin upon\nhim and his Indian race.With a fine dramatic instinct the Sioux reached\nhis climax and abruptly ceased.A low moaning murmur ran round the\ncircle and swelled into a sobbing cry, then ceased as suddenly as there\nstepped into the circle a stranger, evidently a half-breed, who began to\nspeak.He was a French Cree, he announced, and delivered his message in\nthe speech, half Cree, half French, affected by his race.He had come fresh from the North country, from the disturbed district,\nand bore, as it appeared, news of the very first importance from those\nwho were the leaders of his people in the unrest.At his very first\nword Jerry drew a long deep breath and by his face appeared to drop from\nheaven to earth.As the half-breed proceeded with his tale his speech\nincreased in rapidity.said Cameron after they had listened for\nsome minutes.said Jerry, whose vocabulary had been learned\nmostly by association with freighters and the Police.\"He tell 'bout\nbeeg meeting, beeg man Louis Riel mak' beeg noise.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.The whole scene had lost for Jerry its mystic impressiveness and had\nbecome contemptibly commonplace.This was the\npart that held meaning for him.So he pulled up the half-breed with a\nquick, sharp command.\"Listen close,\" he said, \"and let me know what he says.\"And as Jerry interpreted in his broken English the half-breed's speech\nit appeared that there was something worth learning.At this big\nmeeting held in Batoche it seemed a petition of rights, to the Dominion\nParliament no less, had been drawn up, and besides this many plans had\nbeen formed and many promises made of reward for all those who dared to\nstand for their rights under the leadership of the great Riel, while\nfor the Indians very special arrangements had been made and the most\nalluring prospects held out.For they were assured that, when in the far\nNorth country the new Government was set up, the old free independent\nlife of which they had been hearing was to be restored, all hampering\nrestrictions imposed by the white man were to be removed, and the\ngood old days were to be brought back.The effect upon the Indians was\nplainly evident.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the apple there.With solemn faces they listened, nodding now and\nthen grave approval, and Cameron felt that the whole situation held\npossibilities of horror unspeakable in the revival of that ancient\nsavage spirit which had been so very materially softened and tamed\nby years of kindly, patient and firm control on the part of those\nwho represented among them British law and civilization.His original\nintention had been to stride in among these Indians, to put a stop to\ntheir savage nonsense and order them back to their reserves with never a\nthought of anything but obedience on their part.But as he glanced about\nupon the circle of faces he hesitated.This was no petty outbreak of\nill temper on the part of a number of Indians dissatisfied with their\nrations or chafing under some new Police regulation.As his eye traveled\nround the circle he noted that for the most part they were young men.A few of the councilors of the various tribes represented were present.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.Many of them he knew, but many others he could not distinguish in the\ndim light of the fire.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple there.And as Jerry ran over the names he began to realize how widely\nrepresentative of the various tribes in the western country the\ngathering was.Practically every reserve in the West was represented:\nBloods, Piegans and Blackfeet from the foothill country, Plain Crees and\nWood Crees from the North.Even a few of the Stonies, who were supposed\nto have done with all pagan rites and to have become largely civilized,\nwere present.They were the\npicked braves of the tribes, and with them a large number of the younger\nchiefs.At length the half-breed Cree finished his tale, and in a few brief\nfierce sentences he called the Indians of the West to join their\nhalf-breed and Indian brothers of the North in one great effort to\nregain their lost rights and to establish themselves for all time in\nindependence and freedom.Then followed grave discussion carried on with deliberation and courtesy\nby those sitting about the fire, and though gravity and courtesy marked\nevery utterance there thrilled through every speech an ever deepening\nintensity of feeling.The fiery spirit of the red man, long subdued by\nthose powers that represented the civilization of the white man, was\nburning fiercely within them.The insatiable lust for glory formerly won\nin war or in the chase, but now no longer possible to them, burned in\ntheir hearts like a consuming fire.The life of monotonous struggle for\na mere existence to which they were condemned had from the first been\nintolerable to them.The prowess of their fathers, whether in the\nslaughter of foes or in the excitement of the chase, was the theme of\nsong and story round every Indian camp-fire and at every sun dance.For the young braves, life, once vivid with color and thrilling with\ntingling emotions, had faded into the somber-hued monotony of a dull and\nspiritless existence, eked out by the charity of the race who had robbed\nthem of their hunting-grounds and deprived them of their rights as free\nmen.The lust for revenge, the fury of hate, the yearning for the return\nof the days of the red man's independence raged through their speeches\nlike fire in an open forest; and, ever fanning yet ever controlling the\nflame, old Copperhead presided till the moment should be ripe for such\naction as he desired.Should they there and then pledge themselves to their Northern brothers\nand commit themselves to this great approaching adventure?Quietly and with an air of judicial deliberation the Sioux put the\nquestion to them.There was something to be lost and something to be\ngained.And the gain, how\nimmeasurable!A few scattered settlers with no arms nor ammunition, with\nno means of communication, what could they effect?A Government nearly\nthree thousand miles away, with the nearest base of military operations\na thousand miles distant, what could they do?The only real difficulty\nwas the North West Mounted Police.But even as the Sioux uttered the\nwords a chill silence fell upon the excited throng.The North West\nMounted Police, who for a dozen years had guarded them and cared for\nthem and ruled them without favor and without fear!Five hundred red\ncoats of the Great White Mother across the sea, men who had never been\nknown to turn their backs upon a foe, who laughed at noisy threats and\nwhose simple word their greatest chief was accustomed unhesitatingly to\nobey!Small wonder that the mere mention of the name of those gallant\n\"Riders of the Plains\" should fall like a chill upon their fevered\nimaginations.The Sioux was conscious of that chill and set himself to\ncounteract it.he cried with unspeakable scorn, \"the Police!They will\nflee before the Indian braves like leaves before the autumn wind.\"Without a moment's hesitation Cameron sprang to his feet and, standing\nin the dim light at the entrance to the cave, with arm outstretched and\nfinger pointed at the speaker, he cried:\n\n\"Listen!\"With a sudden start every face was turned in his direction.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.Never have the Indians seen a Policeman's back turned in\nflight.\"His unexpected appearance, his voice ringing like the blare of a trumpet\nthrough the cavern, his tall figure with the outstretched accusing arm\nand finger, the sharp challenge of the Sioux's lie with what they all\nknew to be the truth, produced an effect utterly indescribable.For\nsome brief seconds they gazed upon him stricken into silence as with a\nphysical blow, then with a fierce exclamation the Sioux snatched a rifle\nfrom the cave side and quicker than words can tell fired straight at\nthe upright accusing figure.But quicker yet was Jerry's panther-spring.With a backhand he knocked Cameron flat, out of range.Cameron dropped\nto the floor as if dead.\"What the deuce do you mean, Jerry?\"\"You nearly knocked the\nwind out of me!\"grunted Jerry fiercely, dragging him back into the\ntunnel out of the light.cried Cameron in a rage, struggling to free himself\nfrom the grip of the wiry half-breed.hissed Jerry, laying his hand over Cameron's mouth.\"Indian mad--crazy--tak' scalp sure queeck.\"\"Let me go, Jerry, you little fool!\"\"I'll kill you if you\ndon't!I want that Sioux, and, by the eternal God, I am going to have\nhim!\"He shook himself free of the half-breed's grasp and sprang to his\nfeet.cried Jerry again, flinging himself upon him and winding his\narms about him.Indian mad crazy--keel quick--no\ntalk--now.\"Up and down the tunnel Cameron dragged him about as a mastiff might\na terrier, striving to free himself from those gripping arms.Even as\nJerry spoke, through the dim light the figure of an Indian could be seen\npassing and repassing the entrance to the cave.\"We get him soon,\" said Jerry in an imploring whisper.\"Come back\nnow--queeck--beeg hole close by.\"With a great effort Cameron regained his self-control.\"By Jove, you are right, Jerry,\" he said quietly.This\npassage opens on to the canyon about fifty yards farther down.Follow,\nand keep your eye on the Sioux.Without an instant's hesitation Jerry obeyed, well aware that his master\nhad come to himself and again was in command.Cameron meantime groped to the mouth of the tunnel by which he had\nentered and peered out into the dim light.Close to his hand stood an\nIndian in the cavern.Beyond him there was a confused mingling of forms\nas if in bewilderment.The Council was evidently broken up for the time.The Indians were greatly shaken by the vision that had broken in upon\nthem.That it was no form of flesh and blood was very obvious to them,\nfor the Sioux's bullet had passed through it and spattered against the\nwall leaving no trail of blood behind it.There was no holding them\ntogether, and almost before he was aware of it Cameron saw the cavern\nempty of every living soul.Quickly but warily he followed, searching\neach nook as he went, but the dim light of the dying fire showed him\nnothing but the black walls and gloomy recesses of the great cave.At\nthe farther entrance he found Jerry awaiting him.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.\"Beeg camp close by,\" replied Jerry.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.Chief Onawata he mak' more talk--talk all\nnight--then go sleep.Now you get back quick for the men\nand come to me here in the morning.We must not spoil the chance of\ncapturing this old devil.He will have these Indians worked up into\nrebellion before we know where we are.\"So saying, Cameron set forward that he might with his own eyes look upon\nthe camp and might the better plan his further course.First, that he should break up this council\nwhich held such possibilities of danger to the peace of the country.And\nsecondly, and chiefly, he must lay hold of this Sioux plotter, not only\nbecause of the possibilities of mischief that lay in him, but because of\nthe injury he had done him and his.Forward, then, he went and soon came upon the camp, and after observing\nthe lay of it, noting especially the tent in which the Sioux Chief had\ndisposed himself, he groped back to his cave, in a nook of which--for\nhe was nearly done out with weariness, and because much yet lay before\nhim--he laid himself down and slept soundly till the morning.CHAPTER XIII\n\nIN THE BIG WIGWAM\n\n\nLong before the return of the half-breed and his men Cameron was astir\nand to some purpose.A scouting expedition around the Indian camp\nrewarded him with a significant and useful discovery.In a bluff some\ndistance away he found the skins and heads of four steers, and by\nexamination of the brands upon the skins discovered two of them to be\nfrom his own herd.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.\"All right, my braves,\" he muttered.\"There will be a reckoning for this\nsome day not so far away.Meantime this will help this day's work.\"A night's sleep and an hour's quiet consideration had shown him the\nfolly of a straight frontal attack upon the Indians gathered for\nconspiracy.They were too deeply stirred for anything like the usual\nbrusque manner of the Police to be effective.A slight indiscretion,\nindeed, might kindle such a conflagration as would sweep the whole\ncountry with the devastating horror of an Indian war.He recalled the\nvery grave manner of Inspector Dickson and resolved upon an entirely\nnew plan of action.At all costs he must allay suspicion that the Police\nwere at all anxious about the situation in the North.Further, he must\nbreak the influence of the Sioux Chief over these Indians.Lastly, he\nwas determined that this arch-plotter should not escape him again.The sun was just visible over the lowest of the broken foothills when\nJerry and the two constables made their appearance, bringing, with them\nCameron's horse.After explaining to them fully his plan and emphasizing\nthe gravity of the situation and the importance of a quiet, cool and\nresolute demeanor, they set off toward the Indian encampment.\"I have no intention of stirring these chaps up,\" laid Cameron, \"but I\nam determined to arrest old Copperhead, and at the right moment we must\nact boldly and promptly.He is too dangerous and much too clever to be\nallowed his freedom among these Indians of ours at this particular time.Now, then, Jerry and I will ride in looking for cattle and prepared to\ncharge these Indians with cattle-stealing.This will put them on the\ndefensive.You two will remain within sound\nof whistle, but failing specific direction let each man act on his own\ninitiative.\"Before the\nday was over he was to see him in an entirely new role.Nothing in life\nafforded Jerry such keen delight as a bit of cool daring successfully\ncarried through.Hence with joyous heart he followed Cameron into the\nIndian camp.The morning hour is the hour of coolest reason.The fires of emotion and\nimagination have not yet begun to burn.The reactions from anything\nlike rash action previously committed under the stimulus of a heated\nimagination are caution and timidity, and upon these reactions Cameron\ncounted when he rode boldly into the Indian camp.With one swift glance his eye swept the camp and lighted upon the Sioux\nChief in the center of a group of younger men, his tall commanding\nfigure and haughty carriage giving him an outstanding distinction over\nthose about him.At his side stood a young Piegan Chief, Eagle Feather\nby name, whom Cameron knew of old as a restless, talkative Indian, an\nambitious aspirant for leadership without the qualities necessary to\nsuch a position.\"Ah, good morning, Eagle\nFeather!\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Eagle Feather grunted an indistinct reply.Are you in command of this party, Eagle Feather?The Piegan turned and pointed to a short thick set man standing by\nanother fire, whose large well shaped head and penetrating eye indicated\nboth force and discretion.I\nam glad to see you, for I wish to talk to a man of wisdom.\"Slowly and with dignified, almost unwilling step Running Stream\napproached.As he began to move, but not before, Cameron went to meet\nhim.\"I wish to talk with you,\" said Cameron in a quiet firm tone.\"I have a matter of importance to speak to you about,\" continued\nCameron.Running Stream's keen glance searched his face somewhat anxiously.\"I find, Running Stream, that your young men are breaking faith with\ntheir friends, the Police.\"Again the Chief searched Cameron's face with that keen swift glance, but\nhe said not a word, only waited.\"They are breaking the law as well, and I want to tell you they will be\npunished.Where did they get the meat for these kettles?\"A look of relief gleamed for one brief instant across the Indian's face,\nnot unnoticed, however, by Cameron.\"Dunno--deer--mebbe--sheep.\"\"My brother speaks like a child,\" said Cameron quietly.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk there.\"Do deer and\nsheep have steers' heads and hides with brands on?The Commissioner will ask you to explain these hides and\nheads, and let me tell you, Running Stream, that the thieves will spend\nsome months in jail.They will then have plenty of time to think of\ntheir folly and their wickedness.\"An ugly glance shot from the Chief's eyes.\"Dunno,\" he grunted again, then began speaking volubly in the Indian\ntongue.\"I know you can\nspeak English well enough.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the apple.But Running Stream shook his head and continued his speech in Indian,\npointing to a bluff near by.Cameron looked toward Jerry, who interpreted:\n\n\"He say young men tak' deer and sheep and bear.\"Come,\" said Running Stream, supplementing Jerry's interpretation and\nmaking toward the bluff.Cameron followed him and came upon the skins of\nthree jumping deer, of two mountain sheep and of two bear.\"My young men no take cattle,\" said the Chief with haughty pride.\"Maybe so,\" said Cameron, \"but some of your party have, Running Stream,\nand the Commissioner will look to you.He will\ngive you a chance to clear yourself.\"\"My brother is not doing well,\" continued Cameron.\"The Government feed\nyou if you are hungry.The Government protect you if you are wronged.\"A sudden cloud of anger\ndarkened the Indian's face.\"My children--my squaw and my people go hungry--go\ncold in winter--no skin--no meat.\"\"My brother knows--\" replied Cameron with patient firmness--\"You\ntranslate this, Jerry\"--and Jerry proceeded to translate with eloquence\nand force--\"the Government never refuse you meat.Last winter your\npeople would have starved but for the Government.\"\"No,\" cried the Indian again in harsh quick reply, the rage in his\nface growing deeper, \"my children cry--Indian cannot sleep--my white\nbrother's ears are closed.He hear only the wind--the storm--he sound\nsleep.For me no sleep--my children cry too loud.\"\"My brother knows,\" replied Cameron, \"that the Government is far away,\nthat it takes a long time for answer to come back to the Indian cry.But the answer came and the Indian received flour and bacon and tea and\nsugar, and this winter will receive them again.But how can my brother\nexpect the Government to care for his people if the Indians break the\nlaw?These Indians are bad Indians and the Police will\npunish the thieves.A thief is a bad man and ought to be punished.\"Suddenly a new voice broke in abruptly upon the discourse.It was the voice of Onawata, the Sioux\nChief.Cameron paid no heed to the ringing voice.He kept his back turned upon\nthe Sioux.\"My brother knows,\" he continued, addressing himself to Running Stream,\n\"that the Indian's best friend is the Government, and the Police are the\nGovernment's ears and eyes and hands and are ready always to help the\nIndians, to protect them from fraud, to keep away the whisky-peddlers,\nto be to them as friends and brothers.But my brother has been listening\nto a snake that comes from another country and that speaks with a forked\ntongue.Running Stream knows\nthis to be no lie, but the truth.Nor did the Government drive away the\nbuffalo from the Indians.The buffalo were driven away by the Sioux from\nthe country of the snake with the forked tongue.My brother remembers\nthat only a few years ago when the people to which this lying snake\nbelongs came over to this country and tried to drive away from their\nhunting-grounds the Indians of this country, the Police protected the\nIndians and drove", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "And\nnow a little bird has been telling me that this lying snake has been\nspeaking into the ears of our Indian brothers and trying to persuade\nthem to dig up the hatchet against their white brothers, their friends.The Police know all about this and laugh at it.The Police know about\nthe foolish man at Batoche, the traitor Louis Riel.They know he is\na liar and a coward.He leads brave men astray and then runs away and\nleaves them to suffer.And Cameron\nproceeded to give a brief sketch of the fantastic and futile rebellion\nof 1870 and of the ignoble part played by the vain and empty-headed\nRiel.The effect of Cameron's words upon the Indians was an amazement even to\nhimself.They forgot their breakfast and gathered close to the speaker,\ntheir eager faces and gleaming eyes showing how deeply stirred were\ntheir hearts.Cameron was putting into his story an intensity of emotion and passion\nthat not only surprised himself, but amazed his interpreter.Indeed so\namazed was the little half-breed at Cameron's quite unusual display of\noratorical power that his own imagination took fire and his own tongue\nwas loosened to such an extent that by voice, look, tone and gesture he\npoured into his officer's harangue a force and fervor all his own.\"And now,\" continued Cameron, \"this vain and foolish Frenchman seeks\nagain to lead you astray, to lead you into war that will bring ruin\nto you and to your children; and this lying snake from your ancient\nenemies, the Sioux, thinking you are foolish children, seeks to make\nyou fight against the great White Mother across the seas.He has been\ntalking like a babbling old man, from whom the years have taken wisdom,\nwhen he says that the half-breeds and Indians can drive the white man\nfrom these plains.Has he told you how many are the children of the\nWhite Mother, how many are the soldiers in her army?Get me many branches from the trees,\" he commanded sharply to some\nyoung Indians standing near.So completely were the Indians under the thrall of his speech that a\ndozen of them sprang at once to get branches from the poplar trees near\nby.\"I will show you,\" said Cameron, \"how many are the White Mother's\nsoldiers.See,\"--he held up both hands and then stuck up a small twig in\nthe sand to indicate the number ten.Ten of these small twigs he set in\na row and by a larger stick indicated a hundred, and so on till he had\nset forth in the sandy soil a diagrammatic representation of a hundred\nthousand men, the Indians following closely his every movement.\"And all\nthese men,\" he continued, \"are armed with rifles and with great big guns\nthat speak like thunder.And these are only a few of the White Mother's\nsoldiers.How many Indians and half-breeds do you think there are with\nrifles?\"He set in a row sticks to represent a thousand men.\"See,\" he\ncried, \"so many.\"\"Perhaps, if all\nthe Indians gathered, so many with rifles.Now look,\" he said,\n\"no big guns, only a few bullets, a little powder, a little food.My Indian brothers here will not listen to him, but\nthere are others whose hearts are like the hearts of little children who\nmay listen to his lying words.The Sioux snake must be caught and put in\na cage, and this I do now.\"As he uttered the words Cameron sprang for the Sioux, but quicker than\nhis leap the Sioux darted through the crowding Indians who, perceiving\nCameron's intent, thrust themselves in his path and enabled the Sioux to\nget away into the brush behind.\"Head him off, Jerry,\" yelled Cameron, whistling sharply at the same\ntime for his men, while he darted for his horse and threw himself upon\nit.The whole camp was in a seething uproar.The Indians fell away from him\nlike waves from a speeding vessel.On the other side of the little bluff\nhe caught sight of a mounted Indian flying toward the mountains and with\na cry he started in pursuit.It took only a few minutes for Cameron to\ndiscover that he was gaining rapidly upon his man.But the rough rocky\ncountry was not far away in front of them, and here was abundant chance\nfor hiding.Closer and closer he drew to his flying enemy--a hundred\nyards--seventy-five yards--fifty yards only separated them.But the Indian, throwing himself on the far side of his pony, urged him\nto his topmost speed.Cameron steadied himself for a moment, took careful aim and fired.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.The\nflying pony stumbled, recovered himself, stumbled again and fell.But\neven before he reached the earth his rider had leaped free, and, still\nsome thirty yards in advance, sped onward.Half a dozen strides and\nCameron's horse was upon him, and, giving him the shoulder, hurled the\nIndian senseless to earth.In a flash Cameron was at his side, turned\nhim over and discovered not the Sioux Chief but another Indian quite\nunknown to him.His rage and disappointment were almost beyond his control.For an\ninstant he held his gun poised as if to strike, but the blow did not\nfall.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.He put up his gun, turned quickly\naway from the prostrate Indian, flung himself upon his horse and set off\nswiftly for the camp.It was but a mile distant, but in the brief\ntime consumed in reaching it he had made up his mind as to his line of\naction.Unless his men had captured the Sioux it was almost certain that\nhe had made his escape to the canyon, and once in the canyon there was\nlittle hope of his being taken.It was of the first importance that he\nshould not appear too deeply concerned over his failure to take his man.With this thought in his mind Cameron loped easily into the Indian camp.He found the young braves in a state of feverish excitement.Armed with\nguns and clubs, they gathered about their Chiefs clamoring to be allowed\nto wipe out these representatives of the Police who had dared to attempt\nan arrest of this distinguished guest of theirs.As Cameron appeared\nthe uproar quieted somewhat and the Indians gathered about him, eagerly\nwaiting his next move.Cameron cantered up to Running Stream and, looking round upon the\ncrowding and excited braves, he said, with a smile of cool indifference:\n\n\"The Sioux snake has slid away in the grass.After he has eaten we will have\nsome quiet talk.\"So saying, he swung himself from his saddle, drew the reins over his\nhorse's ears and, throwing himself down beside a camp fire, he pulled\nout his pipe and proceeded to light it as calmly as if sitting in a\ncouncil-lodge.Nothing appeals more strongly\nto the Indian than an exhibition of steady nerve.For some moments they\nstood regarding Cameron with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration\nwith a strong admixture of impatience, for they had thought of being\ndone out of their great powwow with its attendant joys of dance and\nfeast, and if this Policeman should choose to remain with them all day\nthere could certainly be neither dancing nor feasting for them.In the\nmeantime, however, there was nothing for it but to accept the situation\ncreated for them.This cool-headed Mounted Policeman had planted himself\nby their camp-fire.They could not very well drive him from their camp,\nnor could they converse with him till he was ready.As they were thus standing about in uncertainty of mind and temper\nJerry, the interpreter, came in and, with a grunt of recognition, threw\nhimself down by Cameron beside the fire.After some further hesitation\nthe Indians began to busy themselves once more with their breakfast.In\nthe group about the campfire beside which Cameron had placed himself was\nthe Chief, Running Stream.The presence of the Policeman beside his fire\nwas most embarrassing to the Chief, for no man living has a keener sense\nof the obligations of hospitality than has the Indian.But the Indian\nhates to eat in the presence of a white man unless the white man shares\nhis meal.Hence Running Stream approached Cameron with a courteous\nrequest that he would eat with them.\"Thanks, Running Stream, I have eaten, but I am sure Jerry here will\nbe glad of some breakfast,\" said Cameron cordially, who had no desire\nwhatever to dip out of the very doubtful mess in the pot which had been\nset down on the ground in the midst of the group around the fire.Jerry, however, had no scruples in the matter and, like every Indian\nand half-breed, was always ready for a meal.Having thus been offered\nhospitality and having by proxy accepted it, Cameron was in position to\ndiscuss with the Chief in a judicial if not friendly spirit the matter\nhe had in hand.Breakfast over, Cameron offered his tobacco-pouch to the Chief, who,\ngravely helping himself to a pipeful, passed it on to his neighbor who,\nhaving done likewise, passed it in turn to the man next him till the\ntobacco was finished and the empty pouch returned with due gravity to\nthe owner.Relations of friendly diplomacy being thus established, the whole party\nsat smoking in solemn silence until the pipes were smoked out.Then\nCameron, knocking the ashes from his pipe, opened up the matter in hand,\nwith Jerry interpreting.\"The Sioux snake,\" he began quietly, \"will be hungry for his breakfast.Honest men do not run away before breakfast.\"\"Huh,\" grunted Running Stream, non-committal.\"The Police will get him in due time,\" continued Cameron in a tone of\nquiet indifference.\"He will cease to trouble our Indian brothers with\nfoolish lies.The prison gates are strong and will soon close upon this\nstranger with the forked tongue.\"Again the Chief grunted, still non-committal.\"It would be a pity if any of your young men should give heed to these\nsilly tales.In the Sioux country\nthere is frequent war between the soldiers and the Indians because bad\nmen wish to wrong the Indians and the Indians grow angry and fight, but\nin this country white men are punished who do wrong to Indians.\"Huh,\" grunted Running Stream acquiescing.\"When Indians do wrong to white men it is just that the Indians should\nbe punished as well.The Police do justly between the white man and the\nIndian.\"Huh,\" again grunted Running Stream with an uneasy look on his face.\"Therefore when young and foolish braves steal and kill cattle they must\nbe punished.Here Cameron's voice\ngrew gentle as a child's, but there was in its tone something that made\nthe Chief glance quickly at his face.\"Huh, my young men no steal cattle,\" he said sullenly.I believe that is true, and that is why I\nsmoke with my brother beside his camp fire.But some young men in this\nband have stolen cattle, and I want my brother to find them that I might\ntake them with me to the Commissioner.\"\"Not know any Indian take cattle,\" said Running Stream in surly\ndefiance.\"There are four skins and four heads lying in the bluff up yonder,\nRunning Stream.I am going to take those with me to the Commissioner and\nI am sure he would like to see you about those skins.\"Cameron's manner\ncontinued to be mild but there ran through his speech an undertone of\nstern resolution that made the Indian squirm a bit.\"Not know any Indian take cattle,\" repeated Running Stream, but with\nless defiance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.\"Then it would be well for my brother to find out the thieves, for,\" and\nhere Cameron paused and looked the Chief steadily in the face for a few\nmoments, \"for we are to take them back with us or we will ask the Chief\nto come and explain to the Commissioner why he does not know what his\nyoung men are doing.\"\"No Blackfeet Indian take cattle,\" said the Chief once more.\"Then it must be the Bloods, or the Piegans or the\nStonies.He had determined to spend\nthe day if necessary in running down these thieves.At his suggestion\nRunning Stream called together the Chiefs of the various bands of\nIndians represented.From his supplies Cameron drew forth some more\ntobacco and, passing it round the circle of Chiefs, calmly waited until\nall had smoked their pipes out, after which he proceeded to lay the case\nbefore them.The Police believe them to be honest\nmen, but unfortunately among them there have crept in some who are not\nhonest.In the bluff yonder are four hides and four heads of steers, two\nof them from my own herd.Some bad Indians have stolen and killed these\nsteers and they are here in this camp to-day, and I am going to take\nthem with me to the Commissioner.Running Stream is a great Chief and\nspeaks no lies and he tells me that none of his young men have taken\nthese cattle.Will the Chief of the Stonies, the Chief of the Bloods,\nthe Chief of the Piegans say the same for their young men?\"\"The Stonies take no cattle,\" answered an Indian whom Cameron recognized\nas the leading representative of that tribe present.What about the Bloods and the Piegans?\"\"It is not for me,\" he continued, when there was no reply, \"to discover\nthe cattle-thieves.It is for the Big Chief of this camp, it is for you,\nRunning Stream, and when you have found the thieves I shall arrest them\nand bring them to the Commissioner, for I will not return without them.Meantime I go to bring here the skins.\"So saying, Cameron rode leisurely away, leaving Jerry to keep an eye\nupon the camp.For more than an hour they talked among themselves, but\nwithout result.Finally they came to Jerry, who, during his years\nwith the Police, had to a singular degree gained the confidence of the\nIndians.There had been much stealing\nof cattle by some of the tribes, not by all.The Police had been\npatient, but they had become weary.They had their suspicions as to the\nthieves.Eagle Feather was anxious to know what Indians were suspected.\"Not the Stonies and not the Blackfeet,\" replied Jerry quietly.It was\na pity, he continued, that innocent men should suffer for the guilty.He\nknew Running Stream was no thief, but Running Stream must find out the\nthieves in the band under his control.How would Running Stream like to\nhave the great Chief of the Blackfeet, Crowfoot, know that he could not\ncontrol the young men under his command and did not know what they were\ndoing?This suggestion of Jerry had a mighty effect upon the Blackfeet Chief,\nfor old Crowfoot was indeed a great Chief and a mighty power with his\nband, and to fall into disfavor with him would be a serious matter for\nany junior Chief in the tribe.Again they withdrew for further discussion and soon it became evident\nthat Jerry's cunning suggestions had sown seeds of discord among them.The dispute waxed hot and fierce, not as to the guilty parties, who were\napparently acknowledged to be the Piegans, but as to the course to be\npursued.Running Stream had no intention that his people and himself\nshould become involved in the consequences of the crimes of other\ntribes whom the Blackfeet counted their inferiors.Eagle Feather and his\nPiegans must bear the consequences of their own misdeeds.On the other\nhand Eagle Feather pleaded hard that they should stand together in this\nmatter, that the guilty parties could not be disclosed.The Police could\nnot punish them all, and all the more necessary was it that they should\nhold together because of the larger enterprise into which they were\nabout to enter.The absence of the Sioux Chief Onawata, however, weakened the bond of\nunity which he more than any other had created and damped the ardor of\nthe less eager of the conspirators.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.It was likewise a serious blow to\ntheir hopes of success that the Police knew all their plans.Running\nStream finally gave forth his decision, which was that the thieves\nshould be given up, and that they all should join in a humble petition\nto the Police for leniency, pleading the necessity of hunger on their\nhunting-trip, and, as for the larger enterprise, that they should\napparently abandon it until suspicion had been allayed and until the\nplans of their brothers in the North were more nearly matured.The time\nfor striking had not yet come.In this decision all but the Piegans agreed.In vain Eagle Feather\ncontended that they should stand together and defy the Police to prove\nany of them guilty.In vain he sought to point out that if in this\ncrisis they surrendered the Piegans to the Police never again could they\ncount upon the Piegans to support them in any enterprise.But Running\nStream and the others were resolved.At the very moment in which this decision had been reached Cameron rode\nin, carrying with him the incriminating hides.\"You take charge of these and bring them to the\nCommissioner.\"\"All right,\" said Jerry, taking the hides from Cameron's horse.said Cameron in a low voice as the half-breed was\nuntying the bundle.Quietly Cameron walked over to the group of excited Indians.As he\napproached they opened their circle to receive him.\"My brother has discovered the thief,\" he said.\"And after all a thief\nis easily found among honest men.\"Slowly and deliberately his eye traveled round the circle of faces,\nkeenly scrutinizing each in turn.When he came to Eagle Feather he\npaused, gazed fixedly at him, took a single step in his direction, and,\nsuddenly leveling an accusing finger at him, cried in a loud voice:\n\n\"I have found him.Slowly he walked up to the Indian, who remained stoically motionless,\nlaid his hand upon his wrist and said in a clear ringing voice heard\nover the encampment:\n\n\"Eagle Feather, I arrest you in the name of the Queen!\"And before\nanother word could be spoken or a movement made Eagle Feather stood\nhandcuffed, a prisoner.CHAPTER XIV\n\n\"GOOD MAN--GOOD SQUAW\"\n\n\n\"That boy is worse, Mrs.Cameron, decidedly worse, and I wash my hands\nof all responsibility.\"Mandy sat silent, weary with watching and weary with the conflict that\nhad gone on intermittently during the past three days.The doctor\nwas determined to have the gangrenous foot off.That was the simplest\nsolution of the problem before him and the foot would have come off days\nago if he had had his way.But the Indian boy had vehemently opposed\nthis proposal.\"One foot--me go die,\" was his ultimatum, and through\nall the fever and delirium this was his continuous refrain.In this\ndetermination his nurse supported him, for she could not bring herself\nto the conviction that amputation was absolutely necessary, and,\nbesides, of all the melancholy and useless driftwood that drives hither\nand thither with the ebb and flow of human life, she could imagine none\nmore melancholy and more useless than an Indian crippled of a foot.Hence she supported the boy in his ultimatum, \"One foot--me go die.\"\"That foot ought to come off,\" repeated the doctor, beginning the\ncontroversy anew.\"But, doctor,\" said Mandy wearily, \"just think how pitiable, how\nhelpless that boy will be.And, besides, I have not\nquite given up hope that--\"\n\nThe doctor snorted his contempt for her opinion; and only his respect\nfor her as Cameron's wife and for the truly extraordinary powers and\ngifts in her profession which she had displayed during the past three\ndays held back the wrathful words that were at his lips.It was late in\nthe afternoon and the doctor had given many hours to this case, riding\nback and forward from the fort every day, but all this he would not have\ngrudged could he have had his way with his patient.\"Well, I have done my best,\" he said, \"and now I must go back to my\nwork.\"\"I know, doctor, I know,\" pleaded Mandy.\"You have been most kind and\nI thank you from my heart.\"\"Don't\nthink me too awfully obstinate, and please forgive me if you do.\"The doctor took the outstretched hand grudgingly.\"Of all the obstinate creatures--\"\n\n\"Oh, I am afraid I am.You see, the\nboy is so splendidly plucky and such a fine chap.\"\"He is a fine chap, doctor, and I can't bear to have him crippled,\nand--\" She paused abruptly, her lips beginning to quiver.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.She was near\nthe limit of her endurance.All right, if that suits you better\nit makes no difference to me,\" said the doctor gruffly, picking up his\nbag.\"Doctor, you will come back again to-morrow?\"I can do no more--unless\nyou agree to amputation.There is no use coming back to-morrow.I can't give all my time to this Indian.\"The\ncontempt in the doctor's voice for a mere Indian stung her like a whip.On Mandy's cheek, pale with her long vigil, a red flush appeared and\nin her eye a light that would have warned the doctor had he known her\nbetter.But the doctor was very impatient and anxious to be gone.Yes, of course, a human being, but there are human\nbeings and human beings.But if you mean an Indian is as good as a white\nman, frankly I don't agree with you.\"\"You have given a great deal of your time, doctor,\" said Mandy with\nquiet deliberation, \"and I am most grateful.I can ask no more for THIS\nINDIAN.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.I only regret that I have been forced to ask so much of your\ntime.There was a ring as of steel in her voice.The doctor\nbecame at once apologetic.\"What--eh?--I beg your pardon,\" he stammered.I don't quite--\"\n\n\"Good-by, doctor, and again thank you.\"\"Well, you know quite well I can't do any more,\" said the old doctor\ncrossly.And awkwardly the doctor walked away,\nrather uncertain as to her meaning but with a feeling that he had been\ndismissed.he muttered as he left the tent door,\nindignant with himself that no fitting reply would come to his lips.And\nnot until he had mounted his horse and taken the trail was he able to\ngive full and adequate expression to his feelings, and even then it\ntook him some considerable time to do full justice to himself and to the\nsituation.Meantime the nurse had turned back to her watch, weary and despairing.In a way that she could not herself understand the Indian boy had\nawakened her interest and even her affection.His fine stoical courage,\nhis warm and impulsive gratitude excited her admiration and touched her\nheart.Again arose to her lips a cry that had been like a refrain in her\nheart for the past three days, \"Oh, if only Dr.Martin had made it only too apparent\nthat the old army surgeon was archaic in his practice and method.she said aloud, as she bent over her\npatient.As if in answer to her cry there was outside a sound of galloping\nhorses.She ran to the tent door and before her astonished eyes there\ndrew up at her tent Dr.Martin, her sister-in-law and the ever-faithful\nSmith.she cried, running to him with both hands\noutstretched, and could say no more.Say, what the deuce have they been doing to you?\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.\"Oh, I am glad, that's all.\"Well, you show your joy in a mighty queer way.\"\"She's done out, Doctor,\" cried Moira, springing from her horse and\nrunning to her sister-in-law.\"I ought to have come before to relieve\nher,\" she continued penitently, with her arms round Mandy, \"but I knew\nso little, and besides I thought the doctor was here.\"\"He was here,\" said Mandy, recovering herself.\"He has just gone, and\noh, I am glad.How did you get here in all the world?\"\"Your telegram came when I was away,\" said the doctor.\"I did not get it\nfor a day, then I came at once.\"I have it here--no, I've left it somewhere--but I\ncertainly got a telegram from you.\"Martin's presence, and--I ventured to send a wire in your name.I hope\nyou will forgive the liberty,\" said Smith, red to his hair-roots and\nlooking over his horse's neck with a most apologetic air.Smith, you are\nmy guardian angel,\" running to him and shaking him warmly by the hand.\"And he brought, us here, too,\" cried Moira.\"He has been awfully good\nto me these days.I do not know what I should have done without him.\"Meantime Smith was standing first on one foot and then on the other in a\nmost unhappy state of mind.\"Guess I will be going back,\" he said in an agony of awkwardness and\nconfusion.\"I've got some chores to look after, and I guess none of you are coming\nback now anyway.\"\"Well, hold on a bit,\" said the doctor.\"Guess you don't need me any more,\" continued Smith.And he\nclimbed on to his horse.No one appeared to have any good reason why Smith should remain, and so\nhe rode away.\"You have really\nsaved my life, I assure you.Smith,\" cried Moira, waving her hand with a bright smile.\"You have saved me too from dying many a time these three days.\"With an awkward wave Smith answered these farewells and rode down the\ntrail.\"He is really a fine fellow,\" said Mandy.\"He has spent his whole time these three\ndays doing things for me.\"\"Ah, no wonder,\" said the doctor.Mandy gave him a detailed history of the case, the doctor meanwhile\nmaking an examination of the patient's general condition.\"And the doctor would have his foot off, but I would not stand for\nthat,\" cried Mandy indignantly as she closed her history.Looks bad enough to come off, I should say.I wish I had been here\na couple of days ago.\"I don't know what the outcome may be, but it\nlooks as bad as it well can.\"\"Oh, that's all right,\" cried Mandy cheerfully.\"Well, whether it will or not I cannot say.But one thing I do know,\nyou've got to trot off to sleep.Show me the ropes and then off you go.\"Oh, the Chief does, Chief Trotting Wolf.And she ran from the tent\nto find the Chief.But she is played right out I can see,\"\nreplied the doctor.echoed the doctor, looking at her as she stood in the\nglow of the westering sun shining through the canvas tent.\"Well, you can just bet that\nis just what I do want.\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.A slight flush appeared on the girl's face.\"I mean,\" she said hurriedly, \"cannot I be of some help?\"\"Most certainly, most certainly,\" said the doctor, noting the flush.\"Your help will be invaluable after a bit.She has been on this job, I understand, for three\ndays.I am quite ready to take my\nsister-in-law's place, that is, as far as I can.And you will surely\nneed some one--to help you I mean.\"The doctor's eyes were upon her\nface.The glow of the sunset through\nthe tent walls illumined her face with a wonderful radiance.\"Miss Moira,\" said the doctor with abrupt vehemence, \"I wish I had the\nnerve to tell you just how much--\"\n\n\"Hush!\"cried the girl, her glowing face suddenly pale, \"they are\ncoming.\"Martin,\" cried Mandy, ushering in that stately\nindividual.The doctor saluted the Chief in due form and said:\n\n\"Could we have another tent, Chief, for these ladies?Just beside this\ntent here, so that they can have a little sleep.\"The Chief grunted a doubtful acquiescence, but in due time a tent very\nmuch dilapidated was pitched upon the clean dry ground close beside\nthat in which the sick boy lay.While this was being done the doctor was\nmaking a further examination of his patient.With admiring eyes,\nMoira followed the swift movements of his deft fingers.There was the sure indication\nof accurate knowledge, the obvious self-confidence of experience in\neverything he did.Even to her untutored eyes the doctor seemed to be\nwalking with a very firm tread.At length, after an hour's work, he turned to Mandy who was assisting\nhim and said:\n\n\"Now you can both go to sleep.\"You will be sure to call me if I can be of service,\" said Mandy.I shall look after\nthis end of the job.\"\"He is very sure of himself, is he not?\"said Moira in a low tone to her\nsister-in-law as they passed out of the tent.\"He has a right to be,\" said Mandy proudly.\"He knows his work, and now\nI feel as if I can sleep in peace.What a blessed thing sleep is,\" she\nadded, as, without undressing, she tumbled on to the couch prepared for\nher.Well, rather--\" Her voice was trailing off again into slumber.Knows his work if that's what you mean.Oh-h--but I'm\nsleepy.\"That\nis, he is a man all through right to his toe-tips.And gentle--more\ngentle than any woman I ever saw.And before\nMoira could make reply she was sound asleep.Before the night was over the opportunity was given the doctor to\nprove his manhood, and in a truly spectacular manner.For shortly\nafter midnight Moira found herself sitting bolt upright, wide-awake and\nclutching her sister-in-law in wild terror.Outside their tent the night\nwas hideous with discordant noises, yells, whoops, cries, mingled with\nthe beating of tom-toms.Terrified and trembling, the two girls sprang\nto the door, and, lifting the flap, peered out.It was the party of\nbraves returning from the great powwow so rudely interrupted by Cameron.They were returning in an evil mood, too, for they were enraged at the\narrest of Eagle Feather and three accomplices in his crime, disappointed\nin the interruption of their sun dance and its attendant joys of feast\nand song, and furious at what appeared to them to be the overthrow of\nthe great adventure for which they had been preparing and planning for\nthe past two months.This was indeed the chief cause of their rage, for\nit seemed as if all further attempts at united effort among the Western\ntribes had been frustrated by the discovery of their plans, by the\nflight of their leader, and by the treachery of the Blackfeet Chief,\nRunning Stream, in surrendering their fellow-tribesmen to the Police.To them that treachery rendered impossible any coalition between the\nPiegans and the Blackfeet.Furthermore, before their powwow had been\nbroken up there had been distributed among them a few bottles of\nwhisky provided beforehand by the astute Sioux as a stimulus to their\nenthusiasm against a moment of crisis when such stimulus should be\nnecessary.These bottles, in the absence of their great leader, were\ndistributed among the tribes by Running Stream as a peace-offering, but\nfor obvious reason not until the moment came for their parting from each\nother.Filled with rage and disappointment, and maddened with the bad whisky\nthey had taken, they poured into the encampment with wild shouting\naccompanied by the discharge of guns and the beating of drums.In terror\nthe girls clung to each other, gazing out upon the horrid scene.But her sister-in-law could give her little explanation.The moonlight,\nglowing bright as day, revealed a truly terrifying spectacle.A band\nof Indians, almost naked and hideously painted, were leaping, shouting,\nbeating drums and firing guns.Out from the tents poured the rest of the\nband to meet them, eagerly inquiring into the cause of their excitement.Soon fires were lighted and kettles put on, for the Indian's happiness\nis never complete unless associated with feasting, and the whole band\nprepared itself for a time of revelry.As the girls stood peering out upon this terrible scene they became\naware of the doctor standing at their side.\"Say, they seem to be cutting up rather rough, don't they?\"\"I think as a precautionary measure you had better step over\ninto the other tent.\"Hastily gathering their belongings, they ran across with the doctor to\nhis tent, from which they continued to gaze upon the weird spectacle\nbefore them.About the largest fire in the center of the camp the crowd gathered,\nChief Trotting Wolf in the midst, and were harangued by one of\nthe returning braves who was evidently reciting the story of their\nexperiences and whose tale was received with the deepest interest and\nwas punctuated by mad cries and whoops.The one English word that could\nbe heard was the word \"Police,\" and it needed no interpreter to\nexplain to the watchers that the chief object of fury to the crowding,\ngesticulating Indians about the fire was the Policeman who had been the\ncause of their humiliation and disappointment.In a pause of the uproar\na loud exclamation from an Indian arrested the attention of the band.Once more he uttered his exclamation and pointed to the tent lately\noccupied by the ladies.Quickly the whole band about the fire appeared\nto bunch together preparatory to rush in the direction indicated, but\nbefore they could spring forward Trotting Wolf, speaking rapidly and\nwith violent gesticulation, stood in their path.He was thrust aside and the whole band came rushing madly\ntoward the tent lately occupied by the ladies.\"Get back from the door,\" said the doctor, speaking rapidly.\"These\nchaps seem to be somewhat excited.I wish I had my gun,\" he continued,\nlooking about the tent for a weapon of some sort.\"This will do,\" he\nsaid, picking up a stout poplar pole that had been used for driving the\ntent pegs.\"But they will kill you,\" cried Moira, laying her hand upon his arm.I'll\nknock some of their blocks off first.\"So saying, he lifted the flap of\nthe tent and passed out just as the rush of maddened Indians came.Upon the ladies' tent they fell, kicked the tent poles down, and,\nseizing the canvas ripped it clear from its pegs.Some moments they\nspent searching the empty bed, then turned with renewed cries toward the\nother tent before which stood the doctor, waiting, grim, silent, savage.For a single moment they paused, arrested by the silent figure, then\nwith a whoop a drink-maddened brave sprang toward the tent, his rifle\nclubbed to strike.Before he could deliver his blow the doctor, stepping\nswiftly to one side, swung his poplar club hard upon the uplifted arms,\nsent the rifle crashing to the ground and with a backward swing caught\nthe astonished brave on the exposed head and dropped him to the earth as\nif dead.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "he\nshouted, swinging his club as a player might a baseball bat.Before the next rush, however, help came in an unexpected form.The tent\nflap was pushed back and at the doctor's side stood an apparition that\nchecked the Indians' advance and stilled their cries.It was the Indian\nboy, clad in a white night robe of Mandy's providing, his rifle in his\nhand, his face ghastly in the moonlight and his eyes burning like flames\nof light.One cry he uttered, weird, fierce, unearthly, but it seemed\nto pierce like a knife through the stillness that had fallen.Awed,\nsobered, paralyzed, the Indians stood motionless.Then from their ranks\nran Chief Trotting Wolf, picked up the rifle of the Indian who still lay\ninsensible on the ground, and took his place beside the boy.A few words he spoke in a voice that rang out fiercely imperious.Again the Chief spoke in short, sharp\nwords of command, and, as they still hesitated, took one swift stride\ntoward the man that stood nearest, swinging his rifle over his head.Forward sprang the doctor to his side, his poplar club likewise swung up\nto strike.Back fell the Indians a pace or two, the Chief following them\nwith a torrential flow of vehement invective.Slowly, sullenly the crowd\ngave back, cowed but still wrathful, and beginning to mutter in angry\nundertones.Once more the tent flap was pushed aside and there issued\ntwo figures who ran to the side of the Indian boy, now swaying weakly\nupon his rifle.cried Mandy, throwing her arms round about him, and,\nsteadying him as he let his rifle fall, let him sink slowly to the\nground.cried Moira, seizing the rifle that the boy had dropped\nand springing to the doctor's side.She\nturned and pointed indignantly to the swooning boy.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.With an exclamation of wrath the doctor stepped back to Mandy's aid,\nforgetful of the threatening Indians and mindful only of his patient.Quickly he sprang into the tent, returning with a stimulating remedy,\nbent over the boy and worked with him till he came back again to life.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.Once more the Chief, who with the Indians had been gazing upon this\nscene, turned and spoke to his band, this time in tones of quiet\ndignity, pointing to the little group behind him.Silent and subdued the\nIndians listened, their quick impulses like those of children stirred\nto sympathy for the lad and for those who would aid him.Gradually the\ncrowd drew off, separating into groups and gathering about the various\nfires.Martin and the Chief carried the boy into the tent and\nlaid him on his bed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.\"What sort of beasts have you got out there anyway?\"said the doctor,\nfacing the Chief abruptly.\"Him drink bad whisky,\" answered the Chief, tipping up his hand.\"Him\ncrazee,\" touching his head with his forefinger.What they want is a few ounces of lead.\"The Chief made no reply, but stood with his eyes turned admiringly upon\nMoira's face.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.\"Squaw--him good,\" he said, pointing to the girl.\"No 'fraid--much\nbrave--good.\"\"You are right enough there, Chief,\" replied the doctor heartily.inquired the Chief, pointing to Moira.No, not exactly,\" replied the doctor, much confused, \"that\nis--not yet I mean--\"\n\n\"Huh!Him good man,\" replied the Chief, pointing first\nto Moira, then to the doctor.replied the Chief, moving out past her.\"Him drink, him\ncrazee--no drink, no crazee.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.At the door he paused, and, looking back,\nsaid once more with increased emphasis, \"Huh!Him good squaw,\" and\nfinally disappeared.\"The old boy is a\nman of some discernment I can see.But the kid and you saved the day,\nMiss Moira.\"It was truly awful, and how\nsplendidly you--you--\"\n\n\"Well, I caught him rather a neat one, I confess.I wonder if the brute\nis sleeping yet.But you did the trick finally, Miss Moira.\"\"Huh,\" grunted Mandy derisively, \"Good man--good squaw, eh?\"CHAPTER XV\n\nTHE OUTLAW\n\n\nThe bitter weather following an autumn of unusual mildness had set in\nwith the New Year and had continued without a break for fifteen days.A\nheavy fall of snow with a blizzard blowing sixty miles an hour had made\nthe trails almost impassable, indeed quite so to any but to those bent\non desperate business or to Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police.To\nthese gallant riders all trails stood open at all seasons of the year,\nno matter what snow might fall or blizzard blow, so long as duty called\nthem forth.The trail from the fort to the Big Horn Ranch, however, was so\nwind-swept that the snow was blown away, which made the going fairly\neasy, and the Superintendent, Inspector Dickson and Jerry trotted along\nfreely enough in the face of a keen southwester that cut to the bone.It was surely some desperate business indeed that sent them out into\nthe face of that cutting wind which made even these hardy riders, burned\nhard and dry by scorching suns and biting blizzards, wince and shelter\ntheir faces with their gauntleted hands.\"It is the raw southwester that gets to the bone,\" replied Inspector\nDickson.\"This will blow up a chinook before night.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.\"I wonder if he has got into shelter,\" said the Superintendent.\"This\nhas been an unusually hard fortnight, and I am afraid he went rather\nlight.\"\"Oh, he's sure to be all right,\" replied the Inspector quickly.\"He was\nriding, but he took his snowshoes with him for timber work.He's hardly\nthe man to get caught and he won't quit easily.\"\"No, he won't quit, but there are times when human endurance fails.Not\nthat I fear anything like that for Cameron,\" added the Superintendent\nhastily.\"Oh, he's not the man to fall down,\" replied the Inspector.\"He goes the\nlimit, but he keeps his head.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\"Well, you ought to know him,\" said the Superintendent.\"You have been\nthrough some things together, but this last week has been about the\nworst that I have known.This fortnight will be remembered in the annals\nof this country.What do you think about\nit, Jerry?\"continued the Superintendent, turning to the half-breed.\"He good man--cold ver' bad--ver' long.S'pose catch heem on\nplains--ver' bad.\"The Inspector touched his horse to a canter.The vision that floated\nbefore his mind's eye while the half-breed was speaking he hated to\ncontemplate.He has come through too many tight places to fail\nhere,\" said the Inspector in a tone almost of defiance, and refused to\ntalk further upon the subject.But he kept urging the pace till they\ndrew up at the stables of the Big Horn Ranch.Direction may, or may\nnot, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of\nthe penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for\nthe priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent\nto think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to\nobscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for\n\"ghostly counsel and advice\".Satan would not be Satan if it were not\nso.But this \"ghostly,\" or spiritual, \"counsel and advice\" has saved\nmany a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,\nand wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct\nto Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of \"going to\nConfession\".{155}\n\n_Indulgences._\n\nThe abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to\nits use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about\nIndulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of\nindulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is\nthe remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It\nis either \"plenary,\" i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or\n\"partial,\" when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church\nhistory, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making\none law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the\nscandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions\nagainst the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But\nIndulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the\nlesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}\n\n_Amendment._\n\nThe promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a\nnecessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises\n\"true amendment\" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest\nto give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not\nonly invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;\nbut the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in\nTennyson's \"Guinevere\":--\n\n  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_\n  _Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again_\n  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._\n\n\nSuch has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,\nand at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as\npart of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of\nCommon Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God's\npardon to the penitent sinner by God's ordained Minister, through the\nordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}\n\n  Lamb of God, the world's transgression\n    Thou alone canst take away;\n  Hear!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.hear our heart's confession,\n    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession\n    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the\nHoly Communion.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the\nsale of indulgences.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the kitchen.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by\nPope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar\nlanguage, \"the Anointing of the Sick\".It is called by Origen \"the\ncomplement of Penance\".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them\npray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the\nprayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;\nand if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.\"Here the Bible states that the \"Prayer of Faith\" with Unction is more\neffective than the \"Prayer of Faith\" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the\nsoul.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it\nalso, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and\nthen, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it\ncleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and\nindirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to\nheal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted\nin Apostolic days, when the Apostles \"anointed with oil many that were\nsick and healed them\" (St.It was continued in the Early\nChurch, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a\n\"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles\") was practically limited to\nthe preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ \"following of\nthe Apostles\") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549\nPrayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,\nlest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as\nBishop Forbes says, \"everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by\nthose who {160} removed it,\" it has not yet been restored.It is \"one\nof the lost Pleiads\" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes\nadds, \"there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and\nScriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person\ndesires it\".[2]\n\n\n\n_Extreme Unction._\n\nAn unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the\nSacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to\nmean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have\nseen, is a \"corrupt,\" and not a correct, \"following of the Apostles\".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of\nritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first\nUnction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy\nOil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,\nlast of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is\nwritten: \"All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner\nof anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible\nsign of an invisible grace\".[3]\n\n{161}\n\n_Its Administration._\n\nIt must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in\nSt.The first condition refers to:--\n\n(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate\ncapacity.Scripture says to the sick: \"Let him call for the Elders,\"\nor Presbyters, \"of the Church\".The word is in the plural; it is to be\nthe united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be\nnothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to\nbe ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private\nhouse, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  \"Let him call for\nthe elders.\"(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their\nown name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),\nbut \"in the Name of the Lord\".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the\nafflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: \"Let them pray over\nhim\".{162}\n\n(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--\"anointing him with oil\".As in Baptism,\nsanctified water is the ordained matter by which \"Jesus Christ\ncleanseth us from all sin\"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the\nordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all\nsickness--bodily, and (adds St.\"And if he have\ncommitted sins, they shall be forgiven him.\"For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:\n_Confession_ and _Intercession_.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.For it follows: \"Confess your faults\none to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed\".Thus\nit is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the \"last\" as with\nthe first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says\nthat, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect\nmore than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,\nand prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing\nguaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and\nin addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized.\"The\nPrayer of Faith\" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more\nin proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being\nmore and more used \"according to the Scriptures\".Both are being used\ntogether in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that\n\"the elders of the Church\" are sent for by the sick; a simple service\nis used; the sick man is anointed; the united \"Prayer of Faith\" (it\n_must_ be \"of Faith\") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual\nhealth, the sick man is \"made whole of whatsoever disease he had\".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,\nmore loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is\nstill to be had._If our love were but more simple,_\n    _We should take Him at His word;_\n  _And our lives would be all sunshine_\n    _In the sweetness of our Lord._\n\n\n\n[1] Article XXV.[2] \"Forbes on the Articles\" (xxv.).[3] \"Institution of a

like the beautiful region in which he dwelt--once\nwild and rugged indeed, but now softened and humanized by generations of\nculture.Even his spectacles could not obscure the friendly and benevolent\nexpression of his large blue eyes.It was evident that he looked at the\nworld, as mirrored before him in the daily journal, with neither cynicism\nnor mere curiosity, but with a heart in sympathy with all the influences\nthat were making it better.The sound of a bell caused the old man to rise and assist his wife to her\nfeet; then, with an affectionate manner, tinged with a fine courtesy of\nthe old school, he supported her to the dining-room, placed her in a\ncushioned chair on his right, at the head of the table, and drew a\nfootstool to her feet.There was a gentleness and solicitude in his\nbearing which indicated that her weakness was more potent than strength\nwould have been in maintaining her ascendency!Meanwhile the rest of the family flocked in with an alacrity which proved\neither that the bitter cold had sharpened their appetites, or that the\nold-fashioned one-o'clock dinner was a cheerful break in the monotony of\nthe day.There was a middle-aged man, who was evidently the strong stay and\nstaff on which the old people leaned.His wife was the housekeeper of the\nfamily, and she was emphatically the \"house-mother,\" as the Germans phrase\nit.Every line of her good, but rather care-worn, face bespoke an anxious\nsolicitude about everybody and everything except herself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.It was apparent\nthat she had inherited not a little of the \"Martha\" spirit, and \"was\ncareful about many things;\" but her slight tendency to worry saved others a\nworld of worriment, for she was the household providence, and her\nnumberless little anxieties led to so much prevention of evil that there\nwas not much left to cure.Such was her untiring attention that her\nthoughtless, growing children seemed cared for by the silent forces of\nnature.Their clothes came to them like the leaves on the trees, and her\ndeft fingers added little ornaments that cost the wearers no more thought\nthan did the blossoms of spring to the unconscious plants of the garden.She was as essential to her husband as the oxygen in the air, and he knew\nit, although demonstrating his knowledge rather quietly, perhaps.But she\nunderstood him, and enjoyed a little secret exultation over the strong\nman's almost ludicrous helplessness and desolation when her occasional\nabsences suspended for a brief time their conjugal partnership.She\nsurrounded the old people with a perpetual Indian-summer haze of\nkindliness, which banished all hard, bleak outlines from their late\nautumnal life.In brief, she was what God and nature designed woman to\nbe--the gracious, pervading spirit, that filled the roomy house with\ncomfort and rest.Sitting near were her eldest son and pride, a lad about\nthirteen years of age, and a girl who, when a baby, had looked so like a\nboy that her father had called her \"Johnnie,\" a sobriquet which still clung\nto her.Close to the mother's side was a little embodiment of vitality,\nmischief, and frolic, in the form of a four-year-old boy, the dear torment\nof the whole house.There remain but two others to be mentioned, and the Clifford family will\nbe complete, as constituted at present.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.The first was the youngest son of\nthe aged man at the head of the table.He had inherited his father's\nfeatures, but there was a dash of recklessness blended with the manifest\nfrankness of his expression, and in his blue eyes there was little trace of\nshrewd calculation or forethought.Even during the quiet midday meal they\nflashed with an irrepressible mirthfulness, and not one at the table\nescaped his aggressive nonsense.His brother, two or three years his\nsenior, was of a very different type, and seemed somewhat overshadowed by\nthe other's brilliancy.He had his mother's dark eyes, but they were deep\nand grave, and he appeared reserved and silent, even in the home circle.His bronzed features were almost rugged in their strength, but a heavy\nmustache gave a touch of something like manly beauty to his rather sombre\nface.You felt instinctively that he was one who would take life\nseriously--perhaps a little too seriously--and that, whether it brought him\njoy or sorrow, he would admit the world but charily to his confidence.Burtis, the youngest brother, had gone through college after a sort of\nneck-or-nothing fashion, and had been destined for one of the learned\nprofessions; but, while his natural ability had enabled him to run the\ngantlet of examinations, he had evinced such an unconquerable dislike for\nrestraint and plodding study that he had been welcomed back to the paternal\nacres, which were broad enough for them all.Clifford, by various\nmeans, had acquired considerable property in his day, and was not at all\ndisappointed that his sons should prefer the primal calling to any other,\nsince it was within his power to establish them well when they were ready\nfor a separate domestic life.It must be admitted, however, that thus far\nthe rural tastes of Burtis were chiefly for free out-of-door life, with its\naccessories of rod, gun, and horses.But Leonard, the eldest, and Webb, the\nsecond in years, were true children of the soil, in the better sense of the\nterm.Their country home had been so replete with interest from earliest\nmemory that they had taken root there like the trees which their father had\nplanted.Leonard was a practical farmer, content, in a measure, to follow\nthe traditions of the elders.Webb, on the other hand, was disposed to look\npast the outward aspects of Nature to her hidden moods and motives, and to\ntake all possible advantage of his discoveries.The farm was to him a\nlaboratory, and, with something of the spirit of the old alchemists, he\nread, studied, and brooded over the problem of producing the largest\nresults at the least cost.He was by no means deficient in imagination, or\neven in appreciation of the beautiful side of nature, when his thoughts\nwere directed to this phase of the outer world; but his imagination had\nbecome materialistic, and led only to an eager quest after the obscure laws\nof cause and effect, which might enable him to accomplish what to his\nplodding neighbors would seem almost miraculous.He understood that the\nforces with which he was dealing were wellnigh infinite; and it was his\ndelight to study them, to combine them, and make them his servants.It was\nhis theory that the energy in nature was like a vast motive power, over\nwhich man could throw the belt of his skill and knowledge, and so produce\nresults commensurate with the force of which he availed himself.There was,\ntherefore, an unfailing zest in his work, and the majority of his labors\nhad the character of experiments, which, nevertheless, were so guided by\nexperience that they were rarely futile or unremunerative.On themes that\naccorded with his tastes and pursuits he would often talk earnestly and\nwell, but his silence and preoccupation at other times proved that it is\nnot best to be dominated by one idea, even though it be a large one.CHAPTER II\n\nAMY WINFIELD\n\n\nThe reader may now consider himself introduced to the household with whom\nhe is invited to sojourn.In time he will grow better acquainted with the\ndifferent members of the family, as they in their several ways develop\ntheir own individuality.Clifford indicates that\nanother guest is expected, who, unlike ourselves, will be present in\nreality, not fancy, and who is destined to become a permanent inmate of\nthe home.\"This is a bitter day,\" he said, \"for little Amy to come to us; and yet,\nunless something unforeseen prevents, she will be at the station this\nevening.\"\"Don't worry about the child,\" Burtis responded, promptly; \"I'll meet\nher, and am glad of an excuse to go out this horrid day.I'll wrap her up\nin furs like an Esquimau.\"\"Yes, and upset her in the drifts with your reckless driving,\" said\ngood-natured Leonard.\"Thunder is wild enough at any time; but of late,\nbetween the cold, high feeding, and idleness, he'll have to be broken\nover again; lucky if he don't break your neck in the operation.The\nlittle girl will feel strange enough, anyway, coming among people that\nshe has never seen, and I don't intend that she shall be frightened out\nof her wits into the bargain by your harum-scarum ways.You'd give her\nthe impression that we were only half-civilized.So I'll drive over for\nher in the family sleigh, and take Alf with me.He will be nearer her own\nage, and help to break the ice.If you want a lark, go out by yourself,\nand drive where you please, after your own break-neck style.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"The ward\ncommitted to me by my dear old friend should be brought to her home with\nevery mark of respect and affection by the one who has the best right to\nrepresent me.I'd go myself, were not the cold so severe; but then\nLeonard's ways are almost as fatherly as my own; and when his good wife\nthere gets hold of the child she'll soon be fused into the family, in\nspite of the zero weather.She'll find all the cold without the door.\"\"I yield,\" said Burtis, with a careless laugh.\"Len shall bring home the\nlittle chick, and put her under his wife's wing.I should probably\nmisrepresent the family, and make a bad first impression; and as for\nWebb, you might as well send the undertaker for her.\"\"I don't think she will feel strange among us very long,\" said Leonard's\nwife.\"She shall hang up her stocking to-night, like the other children,\nand I have some nice little knick-knacks with which to fill it.These,\nand the gifts which the rest of you have provided, will delight her, as\nthey do all little people, and make her feel at once that she is part of\nthe family.\"\"Maggie expresses my purpose fully,\" concluded Mr.\"As far as\nit is within our power, we should make her one of the family.In view of\nmy friend's letters, this is the position that I desire her to sustain,\nand it will be the simplest and most natural relation for us all.Your\nmother and I will receive her as a daughter, and it is my wish that my\nsons should treat her as a sister from the first.\"Amy Winfield, the subject of the above remarks, was the only daughter of a\ngentleman who had once been Mr.Clifford's most intimate friend, and also\nhis partner in many business transactions.Winfield had long resided\nabroad, and there had lost the wife whom he had married rather late in\nlife.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.When feeling his own end drawing near, his thoughts turned wistfully\nto the friend of his early manhood, and, as he recalled Mr.Clifford's\nrural home, he felt that he could desire no better refuge for his child.He\nhad always written of her as his \"little girl,\" and such she was in his\nfond eyes, although in fact she had seen eighteen summers.Her slight\nfigure and girlish ways had never dispelled the illusion that she was still\na child, and as such he had commended her to his friend, who had responded\nto the appeal as to a sacred claim, and had already decided to give her a\ndaughter's place in his warm heart.Winfield could not have chosen a\nbetter guardian for the orphan and her property, and a knowledge of this\ntruth had soothed the last hours of the dying man.It struck Leonard that the muffled figure he picked up at the station and\ncarried through the dusk and snow to the sleigh was rather tall and heavy\nfor the child he was expecting; but he wrapped her warmly, almost beyond\nthe possibility of speaking, or even breathing, and spoke the hearty and\nencouraging words which are naturally addressed to a little girl.After\nseeing that her trunks were safely bestowed in a large box-sledge, under\nthe charge of black Abram, one of the farm-hands, he drove rapidly\nhomeward, admonishing Alfred, on the way, \"to be sociable.\"The boy,\nhowever, had burrowed so deep under the robes as to be invisible and\noblivious.When Leonard was about to lift her out of the sleigh, as he\nhad placed her in it, the young girl protested, and said:\n\n\"I fear I shall disappoint you all by being larger and older than you\nexpect.\"A moment later he was surprised to find that the \"child\" was as tall as\nhis wife, who, with abounding motherly kindness, had received the girl\ninto open arms.Scarcely less demonstrative and affectionate was the\ngreeting of old Mr.Clifford, and the orphan felt, almost from the first,\nthat she had found a second father.\"Why, Maggie,\" whispered Leonard, \"the child is as tall as you are!\"\"There's only the more to welcome, then,\" was the genial answer, and,\nturning to the young girl, she continued, \"Come with me, my dear; I'm not\ngoing to have you frightened and bewildered with all your new relations\nbefore you can take breath.You shall unwrap in your own room, and feel\nfrom the start that you have a nook where no one can molest you or make\nyou afraid, to which you can always retreat;\" and she led the way to a\nsnug apartment, where an air-tight stove created summer warmth.There was\na caressing touch in Mrs.Leonard's assistance which the young girl felt\nin her very soul, for tears came into her eyes as with a deep sigh of\nrelief she sat down on a low chair.\"I feared I should be a stranger among strangers,\" she murmured; \"but I\nalready feel as if I were at home.\"\"You are, Amy,\" was the prompt reply, spoken with that quiet emphasis\nwhich banishes all trace of doubt.\"You are at home as truly as I am.Do you know we all thought that\nyou were a child?I now foresee that we shall be companions, and very\ncompanionable, too, I am sure.\"There was a world of grateful good-will in the dark hazel eyes which Amy\nlifted to the motherly face bending over<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Leonard; \"mother Clifford, the boys, and the\nchildren are all eager to see you.You won't find much ice to break, and\nbefore the evening is over you will feel that you belong to us and we to\nyou.I was, though, on my way here.Everything looked\nso cold and dismal from the car windows, and the gentleman in whose care I\nwas had little to say, though kind and attentive enough.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.I was left to my\nown thoughts, and gave way to a foolish depression; but when your husband\npicked me up in his strong arms, and reassured me as if I were a little\ngirl, my feeling of desolation began to pass away.Clifford's have banished it altogether.I felt as if my own father\nwere blessing me in the friend who is now my guardian, and of whom I have\nheard so often; and, after my long winter journey among strangers, you've\nno idea what a refuge this warm room has already become.Oh, I know I shall\nbe happy.I only wish that dear papa knew how well he has provided for me.\"But come, or that incorrigible Burt will be bursting\nupon us in his impatience, and the little mother must not be kept\nwaiting, either.Weak and gentle\nas she is, she rules us all.\"\"Mother's room\" was, in truth, the favorite haunt of the house, and only\nher need of quiet kept it from being full much of the time.There was\nnothing bleak or repelling in the age it sheltered, and children and\ngrandchildren gathered about the old people almost as instinctively as\naround their genial open fire.This momentous Christmas-eve found them\nall there, a committee of reception awaiting the new inmate of their\nhome.There was an eager desire to know what Amy was like, but it was a\ncuriosity wholly devoid of the spirit of criticism.The circumstances\nunder which the orphan came to them would banish any such tendency in\npeople less kindly than the Cliffords; but their home-life meant so much\nto them all that they were naturally solicitous concerning one who must,\nfrom the intimate relations she would sustain, take from or add much to\nit.Therefore it was with a flutter of no ordinary expectancy that they\nwaited for her appearance.The only one indifferent was Leonard's youngest\nboy, who, astride his grandpa's cane, was trotting quietly about,\nunrestricted in his gambols.Alfred had thawed out since his return from\nthe station, and was eager to take the measure of a possible playmate; but,\nwith the shyness of a boy who is to meet a \"strange girl,\" he sought a\npartial cover behind his grandfather's chair.Little \"Johnnie\" was flitting\nabout impatiently, with her least mutilated doll upon her arm; while her\nuncle Burtis, seated on a low stool by his mother's sofa, pretended to be\nexceedingly jealous, and was deprecating the fact that he would now be no\nlonger petted as her baby, since the child of her adoption must assuredly\ntake his place.Webb, who, as usual, was somewhat apart from the family\ngroup, kept up a poor pretence of reading; and genial Leonard stood with\nhis back to the fire, his hands clasped behind him, beaming upon all, and\nwaiting to shine on the new-comer.Clifford seemed uninfluenced by\nthe warm, bright present.He gazed fixedly into the flickering blaze, and\noccasionally took off his spectacles to wipe away the moisture that\ngathered in his eyes.His thoughts, evidently, were busy with years long\npast, and were following that old, tried friend who had committed to his\nhands so sacred a trust.The latter hesitated a\nmoment, bewildered by the number of eyes turned toward her, and the new\nrelations into which she was entering.She proved that she was not a\nchild by her quick, blushing consciousness of the presence of two young\nmen, who were as yet utter strangers; and they, in turn, involuntarily\ngave to the lender, brown-haired girl quite a different welcome from the\none they had expected to bestow upon a child.Clifford did not\npermit her embarrassment to last a moment, but, stepping hastily forward,\nand encircling her with his arm, he led her to his wife, who brought\ntears into the eyes of the motherless girl by the gentle warmth of her\ngreeting.She monopolized her ward so long that impatient Burtis began to\nexpostulate, and ask when his turn was coming.The young girl turned a\nshy, blushing face toward him, and her cheeks, mantling under the full\nrays of the lamp, rendered the exquisite purity of her complexion all the\nmore apparent.He also began to feel that he was flushing absurdly, but\nhe carried it off with his usual audacity.\"I am much embarrassed and perplexed,\" he said.\"I was led to expect a\nlittle sister that I could romp with, and pick up and kiss; but here is a\nyoung lady that almost paralyzes me with awe.\"\"I'd like to see you paralyzed from any such cause just once,\" Leonard\nremarked, laughingly.\"Go kiss your sister, like a little man.\"The young fellow seemed to relish the ceremony exceedingly, and responsive\nmirthfulness gleamed for a moment in Amy's eyes.Then he dragged Webb\nforward, saying, \"Let me introduce to you the grave and learned member of\nthe family, to whom we all speak with bated breath.You must not expect him\nto get acquainted with you in any ordinary way.He will investigate you,\nand never rest until he has discovered all the hidden laws of your being.Now, Webb, I will support you while Amy kisses you, and then you may sit\ndown and analyze your sensations, and perhaps cipher out a method by which\na kiss can be rendered tenfold more effective.\"Unmoved by his brother's raillery, Webb took the young girl's hand, and\nlooked at her so earnestly with his dark, grave eyes, that hers drooped.\"Sister Amy,\" he said, gently, \"I was prepared to welcome you on general\nprinciples, but I now welcome you for your own sake.Rattle-brain Burt\nwill make a good playmate, but you will come to me when you are in\ntrouble;\" and he kissed her brow.The girl looked up with a swift, grateful glance; it seemed odd to her,\neven at that moment of strong and confused impressions, and with the\nsalutes of her guardians still warm upon her cheek, that she felt a sense\nof rest and security never known before.\"He will be my brother in very\ntruth,\" was the interpretation which her heart gave to his quiet words.They all smiled, for the course of the reticent and undemonstrative young\nman was rather unexpected.Burtis indulged in a ringing laugh, as he\nsaid:\n\n\"Father, mother, you must both feel wonderfully relieved.Webb is to look\nafter Amy in her hours of woe, which, of course, will be frequent in this\nvale of tears.He will console you, Amy, by explaining how tears are\nformed, and how, by a proper regard for the sequence of cause and effect,\nthere might be more or less of them, according to your desire.\"\"I think I understand Webb,\" was her smiling answer.Never before has he opened his\nmouth so widely, and only an occasion like this could have moved him.You\nmust have unconsciously revealed a hidden law, or else he would have been\nas mum as an oyster.\"Leonard, meanwhile, had seated himself, and was holding little Ned on his\nknee, his arm at the same time encircling shy, sensitive Johnnie, who was\nfairly trembling with excited expectancy.Ned, with his thumb in his\nmouth, regarded his new relative in a nonchalant manner; but to the\nlittle girl the home-world was _the_ world, and the arrival in its midst\nof the beautiful lady never seen before was as wonderful as any fairy\ntale.Indeed, that such a June-like creature should come to them that\nwintry day--that she had crossed the terrible ocean from a foreign realm\nfar more remote, in the child's consciousness, than fairy-land--seemed\nquite as strange as if Cinderella had stepped out of the storybook with\nthe avowed purpose of remaining with them until her lost slipper was\nfound.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Leonard, big and strong as he was, felt and interpreted the\ndelicate and thrilling organism of his child, and, as Amy turned toward\nhim, he said, with a smile:\n\n\"No matter about me.We're old friends; for I've known you ever since you\nwere a little girl at the station.What if you did grow to be a young\nwoman while riding home!Stranger things than that happen every day in\nstorybooks, don't they, Johnnie?Johnnie, you must know, has the advantage\nof the rest of us.She likes bread-and-butter, and kindred realities of our\nmatter-of-fact sphere, but she also has a world of her own, which is quite\nas real.I think she is inclined to believe that you are a fairy princess,\nand that you may have a wand in your pocket by which you can restore to her\ndoll the missing nose and arm.\"Amy scarcely needed Leonard's words in order to understand the child, for\nthe period was not remote when, in her own mind, the sharp outlines of\nfact had shaded off into the manifold mysteries of wonderland.Therefore,\nwith an appreciation and a gentleness which won anew all hearts, she took\nthe little girl on her lap, and said, smilingly:\n\n\"I have a wee wand with which, I'm sure, I can do much for you, and\nperhaps something for dolly.I can't claim to be a fairy princess, but I\nshall try to be as good to you as if I were one.\"Webb, with his book upside down, looked at the young girl in a way which\nproved that he shared in Johnnie's wonder and vague anticipation.Alfred,\nbehind his grandfather's chair, was the only one who felt aggrieved and\ndisappointed.Thus far he had been overlooked, but he did not much care,\nfor this great girl could be no companion for him.Amy, however, had\nwoman's best grace--tact--and guessed his trouble.\"Alf,\" she said,\ncalling him by his household name, and turning upon him her large hazel\neyes, which contained spells as yet unknown even to herself--\"Alf, don't\nbe disappointed.You shall find that I am not too big to play with you.\"The boy yielded at once to a grace which he would be years in learning to\nunderstand, and which yet affected him subtilely, and with something of\nthe same influence that it had upon Webb, who felt that a new element was\nentering into his life.Mercurial Burtis, however, found nothing peculiar\nin his own pleasant sensations.He had a score of young lady friends, and\nwas merely delighted to find in Amy a very attractive young woman,\ninstead of a child or a dull, plain-featured girl, toward whom brotherly\nattentions might often become a bore.He lived intensely in the present\nhour, and was more than content that his adopted sister was quite to his\ntaste.Clifford, benignantly, \"you seem to have stepped in\namong us as if there had always been a niche waiting for you, and I think\nthat, after you have broken bread with us, and have had a quiet sleep\nunder the old roof, you will feel at home.Come, I'm going to take you\nout to supper to-night, and, Burt, do you be as gallant to your mother.\"The young fellow made them all laugh by imitating his father's old-style\ncourtesy; and a happy circle of faces gathered around the board in the\ncheerful supper-room, to which a profuse decoration of evergreens gave a\ndelightfully aromatic odor.Clifford's \"grace\" was not a formal\nmumble, but a grateful acknowledgment of the source from which, as he\ntruly believed, had flowed all the good that had blessed their life; and\nthen followed the genial, unrestrained table-talk of a household that, as\nyet, possessed no closeted skeleton.The orphan sat among them, and her\nmourning weeds spoke of a great and recent sorrow, which might have been\ndesolation, but already her kindling eyes and flushed cheeks proved that\nthis strong, bright current of family life would have the power to carry\nher forward to a new, spring-like experience.To her foreign-bred eyes\nthere was an abundance of novelty in this American home, but it was like\nthe strangeness of heaven to the poor girl, who for months had been so\nsad and almost despairing.With the strong reaction natural to youth\nafter long depression, her heart responded to the glad life about her,\nand again she repeated the words to herself, \"I'm sure--oh, I am sure I\nshall be happy here.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.CHAPTER III\n\nA COUNTRY FIRESIDE\n\n\nAfter supper they all gathered for a time in the large general\nsitting-room, and careful Leonard went the rounds of the barn and\nout-buildings.Clifford, with considerate kindness, had resolved to\ndefer all conversation with Amy relating to her bereavement and the\nscenes that had ensued.At this holiday-time they would make every effort\nwithin their power to pierce with light and warmth the cold gray clouds\nthat of late had gathered so heavily over the poor child's life.At the\nsame time their festivities would be subdued by the memory of her recent\nsorrow, and restricted to their immediate family circle.But, instead of\nobtrusive kindness, they enveloped her in the home atmosphere, and made\nher one of them.Clifford kept her near and\nretained her hand was a benediction in itself.Leonard was soon heard stamping the snow from his boots on the back\npiazza, and in a few moments he entered, shivering.\"The coldest night of the year,\" he exclaimed.\"Ten below zero, and it\nwill probably be twelve before morning.It's too bad, Amy, that you have\nhad such a cold reception.\"\"The thermometer makes a good foil for your smile,\" she replied.\"Indeed,\nI think the mercury rose a little while you were looking at it.\"\"Oh no,\" he said, laughing, \"even you could not make it rise to-night.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the apple there.I say, Ned, tell us what mamma\nhas for Amy's stocking.What a good joke it is, to be sure I We all had\nthe impression you were a little girl, you know, and selected our gifts\naccordingly.Maggie had\nplanned to have you hang up your stocking with the children, and such a\nlot of little traps and sweets she has for you!\"The boy, to whom going to bed at the usual hour was a heavy cross on this\nmomentous evening, promptly availed himself of a chance for delay by\nclimbing on Amy's lap, and going into a voluble inventory of the contents\nof a drawer into which he had obtained several surreptitious peeps.His\neffort to tell an interminable story that he might sit up longer, the\ndroll havoc he made with his English, and the naming of the toys that\nwere destined for the supposed child, evoked an unforced merriment which\nbanished the last vestige of restraint.\"Well, I'm glad it has all happened so,\" said Amy, after the little\nfellow had reluctantly come to the end of his facts and his invention\nalso.\"You make me feel as if I had known you for years--almost,\nindeed, as if I had come to you as a little girl, and had grown up among\nyou.Come, Ned, it shall all turn out just as you expected.I'll go with\nyou upstairs, and hang my stocking beside yours, and mamma shall put into\nit all the lovely things you have told me about.Santa Claus does not\nknow much about my coming here, nor what kind of a girl I am, so your\nkind mamma meant to act the part of Santa Claus in my behalf this year,\nand give him a chance to get acquainted with me.But he knows all about\nyou, and there's no telling how soon he may come to fill your stocking.You know he has to fill the stockings of all the little boys and girls in\nthe country, and that will take a long time.So I think we had better go\nat once, for I don't believe he would like it if he came and found you up\nand awake.\"This put a new aspect upon going to bed early, and having seen his short,\nchubby stocking dangling with a long, slender one of Amy's by the\nchimney-side, Ned closed his eyes with ineffable content and faith.Amy\nthen returned to the sitting-room, whither she was soon followed by Maggie,\nand after some further light and laughing talk the conversation naturally\ndrifted toward those subjects in which the family was practically\ninterested.\"Won't this finish the peach\nand cherry buds?I've always heard that ten degrees of cold below zero\ndestroyed the fruit germs.\"\"Not always,\" replied the man of long experience.\"It depends much upon\ntheir condition when winter sets in, and whether, previous to the cold\nsnap, there have been prolonged thaws.The new growth on the trees\nripened thoroughly last fall, and the frost since has been gradual and\nsteady.I've known peach-buds to survive fifteen below zero; but there's\nalways danger in weather like this.We shall know what the prospects are\nafter the buds thaw out.\"\"Now, Webb, is your chance to shine,\" cried Burtis.\"Hitherto, Amy, the\noracle has usually been dumb, but you may become a priestess who will\nevoke untold stores of wisdom.\"Webb flushed slightly, but again proved that his brother's banter had\nlittle influence.\"If you are willing to wait a few days,\" he said, with a smile, \"I can\nmake clear to you, by the aid of a microscope, what father means, much\nbetter than I can explain.I can then show you the fruit germs either\nperfect or blackened by the frost.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.\"I'll wait, and remind you of your promise, too.I don't know nearly as\nmuch about the country as a butterfly or a bird, but should be quite as\nunhappy as they were I condemned to city life.So you must not laugh at\nme if I ask no end of questions, and try to put my finger into some of\nyour horticultural pies.\"His pleased look contained all the assurance she needed, and he resumed,\nspeaking generally: \"The true places for raising peaches--indeed, all the\nstone-fruits--successfully in this region are the plateaus and <DW72>s of\nthe mountains beyond us.At their height the mercury never falls as low\nas it does with us, and when we have not a peach or cherry I have found\nsuch trees as existed high up among the hills well laden.\"\"Look here, uncle Webb,\" cried Alf, \"you've forgotten your geography.The\nhigher you go up the colder it gets.\"The young man patiently explained to the boy that the height of the\nHighlands is not sufficient to cause any material change in climate,\nwhile on still nights the coldest air sinks to the lowest levels, and\ntherefore the trees in the valleys and at the base of the mountains\nsuffer the most.\"But what you say,\" he concluded, \"is true as a rule.The mercury does range lower on the hills; and if they were a thousand or\nfifteen hundred feet higher peaches could not be grown at all.\"Amy mentally soliloquized: \"I am learning not only about the mercury, but\nalso--what Alf has no doubt already found out--that Webb is the one to go\nto if one wishes anything explained.What's more, he wouldn't, in giving\nthe information, overwhelm one with a sense of deplorable ignorance.\"In accordance with his practical bent, Webb continued: \"I believe that a\ngreat deal of money could be made in the Highlands by raising peaches.The\ncrop would be almost certain, and the large late varieties are those which\nbring the extraordinary prices.What is more, the mountain land would\nprobably have the quality of virgin soil.You remember, father, don't you,\nwhen peaches in this region were scarcely troubled by disease?\"There was a time when they would live on almost like\napple-trees, and give us an abundance of great luscious fruit year after\nyear.Even with the help of the pigs we could not dispose of the crops,\nthe bulk of which, in many instances, I am sorry to say, went into\nbrandy.What was that you were reading the other day about peaches in\nHawthorne's description of the Old Manse?\"Webb took the book and read: \"Peach-trees which, in a good year, tormented\nme with peaches neither to be eaten nor kept, nor, without labor and\nperplexity, to be given away.\"\"That hits it exactly,\" resumed the old gentleman, laughing, \"only every\nyear was a good year then, and we had not the New York market within\nthree hours of us.Even if we had, a large modern orchard would have\nsupplied it.One of the most remarkable of the changes I've witnessed in\nmy time is the enormous consumption of fruit in large cities.Why, more\nis disposed of in Newburgh than used to go to New York.But to return to\npeaches; our only chance for a long time has been to plant young trees\nevery year or two, and we scarcely secured a crop more than once in three\nyears.Even then the yellows often destroyed the trees before they were\nold enough to bear much.They are doing far better of late along the\nHudson, and there is good prospect that this region will become the\ngreatest peach-growing locality in the country.\"\"I'm sure you are right,\" assented Webb, \"and I think it will pay us to\nplant largely in the spring.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.I don't suppose you ever saw a peach-orchard\nin England, Amy?\"They were all grown in front of sunny walls,\n_espalier_, as papa termed it.\"Yes,\" resumed Webb, \"the climate there is too cool and humid for even\nthe wood to ripen.Here, on the contrary, we often have too vivid\nsunshine.I propose that we put out all the north <DW72> in peaches.\"In my opinion it is not the frost, unless it be very\nsevere, that plays the mischief with the buds, but alternate freezing and\nthawing, especially after the buds have started in spring.On a northern\n<DW72> the buds usually remain dormant until the danger of late frosts is\nover.I am quite sure, too, that the yellows is a disease due chiefly to\ncareless or dishonest propagation.Pits and buds have been taken from\ninfected trees, and thus the evil has been spread far and wide.There is\nas much to be gained in the careful and long-continued selection of\nfruits and vegetables as in the judicious breeding of stock.\"\"Has no remedy for the yellows been discovered?\"The evil should be extirpated as fast as it\nappears.Prevention is far better than any attempt at cure.The thing to\ndo is to obtain healthier trees, and then set them out on new land.That's why I think the north <DW72> will be a good place, for peaches have\nnever been grown there in my memory.\"\"Len and Webb are now fairly astride of their\nhorticultural hobbies.Come with me, and see the moon shining on old\nStorm King.\"They pushed aside the heavy crimson curtains, which added a sense of warmth\nto the cheerful room, and looked at the cold white world without--a ghost\nof a world, it seemed to Amy.The moon, nearly full, had risen in the gap\nof the Highlands, and had now climbed well above the mountains, softening\nand etherealizing them until every harsh, rugged outline was lost.The\nriver at their feet looked pallid and ghostly also.When not enchained by\nfrost, lights twinkled here and there all over its broad surface, and the\nintervals were brief when the throbbing engines of some passing steamer\nwere not heard.Now it was like the face of the dead when a busy life is\nover.\"It's all very beautiful,\" said Amy, shivering, \"but too cold and still.I love life, and this reminds one of death, the thoughts of which, with\nall that it involves, have oppressed me so long that I must throw off the\nburden.I was growing morbid, and giving way to a deeper and deeper\ndepression, and now your sunny home life seems just the antidote for it\nall.\"The warm-hearted fellow was touched, for there were tears in the young\ngirl's eyes.\"You have come to the right place, Amy,\" he said, eagerly.\"You cannot love life more than I, and I promise to make it lively for\nyou.I'm just the physician to minister to the mind diseased with\nmelancholy.I can do a hundred-fold more for you than delving,\nmatter-of-fact Webb.So come to me when you have the blues.Let us make\nan alliance offensive and defensive against all the powers of dulness and\ngloom.\"\"I'll do my best,\" she replied, smiling; \"but there will be hours, and\nperhaps days, when the past with its shadows will come back too vividly\nfor me to escape it.\"\"I'll banish all shadows, never fear.I'll make the present so real and\njolly that you will forget the past.\"\"I don't wish to forget, but only to think of it without the dreary\nforeboding and sinking of heart that oppressed me till I came here.I\nknow you will do much for me, but I am sure I shall like Webb also.\"He's one of the best fellows in the world.Don't\nthink that I misunderstand him or fail to appreciate his worth because I\nlove to run him so.Perhaps you'll wake him up and get him out of his\nruts.But I foresee that I'm the medicine you most need.Come to the\nfire; you are shivering.\"\"Oh, I'm so glad that I've found such a home,\" she said, with a grateful\nglance, as she emerged from the curtains.CHAPTER IV\n\nGUNNING BY MOONLIGHT\n\n\nWebb saw the glance from eyes on which were still traces of tears; he\nalso saw his brother's look of sympathy; and with the kindly purpose of\ncreating a diversion to her thoughts he started up, breaking off his\ndiscussion with Leonard, and left the room.A moment later he returned\nfrom the hall with the double-barrelled gun.cried Burt, on the _qui vive_.\"You will make Amy\nthink we are attacked by Indians.\"\"If you are not afraid of the cold, get your gun, and I think I can give\nyou some sport, and, for a wonder, make you useful also,\" Webb replied.\"While you were careering this afternoon I examined the young trees in\nthe nursery, and found that the rabbits were doing no end of mischief.It\nhas been so cold, and the snow is so deep, that the little rascals are\ngathering near the house.They have gnawed nearly all the bark off the\nstems of some of the trees, and I doubt whether I can save them.At first\nI was puzzled by their performances.You know, father, that short nursery\nrow grafted with our seedling apple, the Highland Beauty?Well, I found\nmany of the lower twigs taken off with a sharp, slanting cut, as if they\nhad been severed with a knife, and I imagined that a thrifty neighbor had\nresolved to share in our monopoly of the new variety, but I soon discovered\nthat the cuttings had been made too much at random to confirm the\nimpression that some one had been gathering scions for grafting.Tracks on\nthe snow, and girdled trees, soon made it evident that rabbits were the\ndepredators.One of the little pests must have climbed into a bushy tree at\nleast eighteen inches from the snow, in order to reach the twigs I found\ncut.\"\"Who ever heard of such a\nthing?\"\"Well, you can see for yourself to-morrow,\" Webb resumed.\"Of course we\ncan't afford to pasture the little fellows on our young trees, and so\nmust feed them until they can be shot or trapped.The latter method will\nbe good fun for you, Alf.This afternoon I placed sweet apples,\ncabbage-leaves, and turnips around the edge of a little thicket near the\ntrees; and, Burt, you know there is a clump of evergreens near, from\nwhose cover I think we can obtain some good shots.So get your gun, and\nwe'll start even.\"At the prospect of sport Burt forgot Amy and everything else, and dashed\noff.\"Oh, papa, can't I go with them?\"Leonard asked his wife, who now entered.If you will let mamma bundle you up--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, anything, if I can only go!\"cried Alf, trembling with\nexcitement.\"Sister Amy,\" Webb remarked, a little diffidently, \"if you care to see\nthe fun, you can get a good view from the window of your room.I'll load\nmy gun in the hall.\"Amy asked, catching some of Alf's strong interest.I think you will soon find that you can do pretty much as you\nplease in your new home.You are now among republicans, you know, and we\nare scarcely conscious of any government.\"\"But I have already discovered one very strong law in this household,\"\nshe smilingly asserted, as she stood beside him near the hall-table, on\nwhich he had placed his powder-flask and shot-pouch.he asked, pouring the powder carefully into the\nmuzzles of the gun.\"The law of kindness, of good-will.Why,\" she exclaimed, \"I expected to\nbe weeks in getting acquainted, but here you are all calling me sister\nAmy as if it were the most natural thing in the world.It seems so odd,\"\nshe laughed, \"that I am not a bit afraid of you, even with your gun, and\nyet we have just met, as it were.The way you and your brothers say\n'sister Amy' makes the relation seem real.I can scarcely believe that I\nam the same girl that stepped down at the station this evening, nor can I\nget over my pleased wonder at the transformation.\"\"Amy,\" said the young man, earnestly, \"your coming promises so much to us\nall!You were just the one element lacking in our home.I already have the presentiment that you will do more for us than\nwe can for you.\"\"I ought to do all that the deepest gratitude could prompt.You have\nnever known what it is to be desolate one hour, and to find an ideal home\nthe next.\"\"I wish it might be an ideal home to you; but don't expect too much.You\nwill find some of us very human.\"\"Therefore I shall feel the more at home.Papa always spoiled me by\nletting me have my own way, and I shall often tax your patience.Do you\nknow, I never saw a gun loaded before.There seems to be so much going on\nhere, and I have lived such a quiet life of late.How will you make the\nthing go off?\"\"These little precussion-caps will do the business.It seems to me that\nI've always been quiet, and perhaps a trifle heavy.I hope you will think\nit your mission to render me less matter-of-fact.I'm ready now, and here\ncomes Burt with his breech-loader.If you will go to your room now, you\ncan see our shots.\"A moment later she stood with Johnnie at her window, both almost holding\ntheir breath in expectation as they saw the young men, with Alf following,\nsteal toward a clump of evergreens behind the house.\"Quiet and steady now,\" Webb cautioned his eager brother; \"and, Alf, you\nstep in my tracks, so there may be no noise.\"Thus they made their way\namong the pines, and peered cautiously out.\"Hold on, Burt,\" Webb\nwhispered, as the former was bringing his gun to his shoulder; \"I want a\ncrack at them as well as yourself.Yes, there are\nthree or four of the scamps.They look so pretty in the\nmoonlight that I've scarcely the heart to disturb, much less to kill\nthem.\"\"It's\nconfoundedly cold, and they may take fright and disappear.\"\"If there isn't one in the apple\nnursery in spite of all my provision for them!I'll take him, and you that big fellow munching a cabbage-leaf.We'll\ncount three--now, one, two--\" The two reports rang out as one, and the\nwatchers at the window saw the flashes, and thrilled at the reverberating\nechoes.\"It's almost as exciting as if they were shooting Indians, robbers, or\ngiants,\" cried Johnnie, clapping her hands and jumping up and down.\"Back,\" said Webb to Alf, who was about to rush forward to secure the\ngame; \"we may get another shot.\"They waited a few moments in vain, and then succumbed to the cold.To Alf\nwas given the supreme delight of picking up the game that lay on the\nsnow, making with their blood the one bit of color in all the white\ngarden.Webb remarked, as he joined the family gathered\naround Alf and the rabbits in the sitting-room.\"It's a pity the world\nwasn't wide enough for us all.\"\"Has\nthere been a hidden spring of sentiment in your nature all these years,\nwhich has just struck the surface?\"It was evident that nearly all shared in Webb's mild regret that such a\nsudden period had been put to life at once so pretty, innocent, and\nharmful.Alf, however, was conscious of only pure exultation.Your boy is\nusually a genuine savage, governed solely by the primal instinct of the\nchase and destruction of wild animals.He stroked the fur, and with eyes\nof absorbed curiosity examined the mischievous teeth, the long ears, the\nqueer little feet that never get cold, and the places where the lead had\nentered with the sharp deadly shock that had driven out into the chill\nnight the nameless something which had been the little creature's life.Amy, too, stroked the fur with a pity on her face which made it very\nsweet to Webb, while tender-hearted Johnnie was exceedingly remorseful,\nand wished to know whether \"the bunnies, if put by the fire, would not\ncome to life before morning.\"Indeed, there was a general chorus of\ncommiseration, which Burt brought to a prosaic conclusion by saying:\n\"Crocodile tears, every one.", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "You'll all enjoy the pot-pie to-morrow with\ngreat gusto.By the way, I'll prop up one of these little fellows at the\nfoot of Ned's crib, and in the morning he'll think that the original\n'Br'er Rabbit' has hopped out of Uncle Remus's stories to make him a\nChristmas visit.\"CHAPTER V\n\nCHRISTMAS EVE AND MORNING\n\n\nOld Mrs.Clifford now created a diversion by asking: \"How about our\nplants to-night, Maggie?Once\nbefore when it was as cold as this we lost some, you know.\"\"Leonard,\" said his wife, in response to the suggestion, \"it will be\nsafer for you to put a tub of water in the flower-room; that will draw\nthe frost from the plants.Mother is the queen of the flowers in this\nhouse,\" continued Mrs.Leonard, turning to Amy, \"and I think she will be\ninclined to appoint you first lady in attendance.She finds me cumbered\nwith too many other cares.Mother has only to look\nat the plants to make them grow and bloom.\"\"There you are mistaken,\" replied the old lady, laughing.I never made much of a fuss over my babies, but I loved\nthem, and saw that they had just what they needed at the right time.\"\"That accounts for Webb's exuberant growth and spirit, and the ethereal\nbeauty of Len's mature blossoming,\" remarked Burt.\"You are a plant that never had enough pruning,\" retorted his portly\neldest brother.\"I shall be glad to help you, if you will teach me how,\" Amy said to Mrs.\"Possibly,\" was the reply, with an arch little look which delighted the\nyoung fellow.Clifford, \"sing a Christmas carol before we\nseparate.It will be a pleasant way of bringing our happy evening to a\nclose.\"\"Amy,\" she asked, \"can't you help me?\"\"I'll do my best, if you will choose something I know.\"A selection was soon made, and Amy modestly blended a clear, sweet voice\nwith the air that Mrs.Leonard sang, and as the sympathetic tones of the\nyoung girl swelled the rich volume of song the others exchanged looks of\nunaffected pleasure.\"Oh, Amy, I am so glad you can sing!\"Clifford, \"for we have\nalways made so much of music in our home.\"\"Papa,\" she replied, with moist eyes, \"felt as you do, and he had me sing\nfor him ever since I can remember.\"Leonard, in a low voice, \"suppose you take the\nsoprano and I the alto in the next stanza.\"They were all delighted with the result, and another selection was made,\nin which Burt's tenor and Webb's bass came in with fine effect.\"Amy, what a godsend you are to us all!\"\"I\nam one of the great army of poets who can't sing, but a poet nevertheless.\"\"Yes, indeed, Len,\" added Burt; \"it needs but a glance to see that you\nare of that ethereal mold of which poets and singers are made.Clifford, \"do you know an old Christmas hymn that your\nfather and I loved when we were as young as you are?\"\"I have often sung it for him, and he usually spoke of you when I did\nso\"; and she sang sweet, undying words to a sweet, quaint air in a voice\nthat trembled with feeling.The old gentleman wiped his eyes again and again.he said, \"how\nthat takes me back into the past!My friend and I knew and loved that air\nand hymn over sixty years ago.I can see him now as he looked then.God\nbless his child, and now my child!\"he added, as he drew Amy caressingly\ntoward him.\"A brief evening has made you one of us.I thank God that he\nhas sent one whom it will be so easy for us all to love; and we gratefully\naccept you as a Christmas gift from Heaven.\"Then, with the simplicity of an ancient patriarch, he gathered his\nhousehold around the family altar, black Abram and two maids entering at\nhis summons, and taking seats with an air of deference near the door.Not\nlong afterward the old house stood silent and dark in the pallid landscape.Though greatly wearied, Amy was kept awake during the earlier part of the\nnight by the novelty of her new life and relations, and she was awakened\nin the late dawn of the following day by exclamations of delight from\nMrs.The children evidently had found their stockings, for she heard Johnnie\nsay, \"Oh, mamma, do you think Aunt Amy is awake?I would so like to take\nher stocking to her!\"\"Yes,\" cried Amy, \"I'm awake\"; and the little girl, draped in white, soon\npushed open the door, holding her own and Amy's stockings in hands that\ntrembled with delightful anticipation.\"Jump into bed with me,\" said Amy, \"and we will empty our stockings\ntogether.\"The years rolled back, the previous months of sorrow and suffering were\nforgotten; the day, the hour, with its associations, the eager child that\nnestled close to her, made her a child again.She yielded wholly to her\nmood; she would be a little girl once more, Johnnie's companion in\nfeeling and delight; and the morning of her life was still so new that\nthe impulses of that enchanted age before the light of experience has\ndefined the world into its matter-of-fact proportions came back unforced\nand unaffected.Her voice vied with Johnnie's in its notes of excitement\nand pleasure, and to more than one who heard her it seemed that their\nfirst impression was correct, that a little child had come to them, and\nthat the tall, graceful maiden was a myth.cried the voice of Webb on the stairs.The child vanished instantly, and a blushing girl let fall the half-emptied\nstocking.Something in that deep voice proved that if she were not yet a\nwoman, she had drawn so near that mystery of life that its embarrassing\nself-consciousness was beginning to assert itself.was her mental comment, as she returned his greeting in a voice that\nwas rather faint.The \"rising bell\" now resounded through the house, and she sprang up with\nthe purpose of making amends by a manner of marked dignity.And yet there\nremained with her a sense of home security, of a great and new-found\nhappiness, which the cold gray morning could not banish.The air-tight\nstove glowed with heat and comfort, and she afterward learned that Mrs.Leonard had replenished the fire so noiselessly as not to awaken her.The\nhearty Christmas greetings of the family as she came into the\nbreakfast-room were like an echo of the angels' song of \"good-will.\"The\nabounding kindliness and genuine pleasure at her presence made the feeling\nthat she had indeed become one of the household seem the most natural thing\nin the world, instead of a swiftly wrought miracle.Little Ned had in his arms one of the rabbits that had been shot on the\nprevious evening, and to him it was more wonderful than all his toys.\"You should have seen him when he awoke,\" said his mother, \"and saw the\npoor little thing propped up at the foot of his crib.His eyes grew wider\nand rounder, and at last he breathed, in an awed whisper, 'Br'er Rabbit.'But he soon overcame his surprise, and the jargon he talked to it made\nour sides ache with laughing.\"The gifts that had been prepared for the supposed child were taken by Amy\nin very good part, but with the tact of a well-bred girl who would not\nspoil a jest, rather than with the undisguised delight of Johnnie.\"Only Johnnie and I have seen little Amy,\" said Leonard--\"I at the depot\nbefore she grew up; and this morning she became a little girl again as a\nChristmas wonder for my little girl.Johnnie's faith and fairy lore may\nmake the transformation possible to her again, but I fear the rest of us\nwill never catch another glimpse of the child we expected\"; for Amy's\ngrown-up air since she had appeared in the breakfast-room had been almost\na surprise to him after hearing through the partition her pretty nonsense\nover her stocking.\"I fear you are right,\" said Amy, with a half-sigh; \"and yet it was\nlovely to feel just like Johnnie once more;\" and she stole a shy glance\nat Webb, who must have heard some of her exclamations.The expression of\nhis face seemed to reassure her, and without further misgiving she joined\nin a laugh at one of Burt's sallies.CHAPTER VI\n\nNATURE'S HALF-KNOWN SECRETS\n\n\nAmy's thoughts naturally reverted before very long to Mrs.Clifford's\npets--the flowers--and she asked how they had endured the intense cold of\nthe night.\"They have had a narrow escape,\" the old lady replied.\"If Maggie had not\nsuggested the tub of water last night, I fear we should have lost the\ngreater part of them.\"Leonard, \"I went to the flower-room with fear and\ntrembling this morning, and when I found the water frozen thick I was in\ndespair.\"\"It was the water freezing that saved the plants,\" Webb remarked,\nquietly.\"I put water in the root-cellar before I went to bed last night,\nwith like good effect.\"\"Well, for the life of me,\" said Maggie, \"I can't understand why the\nplants and roots don't freeze when water does.\"\"Come, Burt,\" added her husband, \"you are a college-bred man.You explain\nhow the water draws the frost from the plants.\"Burt answered, flushing slightly, \"I've forgotten.Some\nprinciple of latent heat involved, I believe.If he could live\nlong enough he'd coax from Nature all her secrets.He's the worst Paul\nPry into her affairs that I ever knew.So beware, Amy, unless you are\nmore secretive than Nature, which I cannot believe, since you seem so\nnatural.\"\"I'm afraid your knowledge, Burt, resembles latent heat,\" laughed\nLeonard.\"Come, see what you can do, Webb.\"\"Burt is right,\" said Webb, good-naturedly; \"the principle of latent heat\nexplains it all, and he could refresh his memory in a few moments.The\nwater does not draw the frost from the plants, but before it can freeze\nit must give out one hundred and forty degrees of latent heat.The\nflower-room and root-cellar were therefore so much warmer during the\nnight than if the water had not been there.The plants that were nipped\nprobably suffered after the ice became so thick as to check in a great\nmeasure the freezing process.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.\"By keeping it warm, on the same principle that your bed-clothes kept you\nwarm last night.Heat passes very slowly through ice-that is, it is a\npoor conductor.With the snow it is the winter wrap of nature, which\nprotects all life beneath it.When our ponds and rivers are once frozen\nover, the latent heat in the water beneath can escape through the ice but\nvery gradually, and every particle of ice that forms gives out into the\nwater next to it one hundred and forty degrees of heat.Were it not for\nthese facts our ponds would soon become solid.But to return to the tub\nof water in the flower-room.The water, when placed there, was probably\nwarmer than the air, and so would give out or radiate its heat until a\nthermometer, placed either in the room or in the water, would mark\nthirty-two degrees above zero.At this point the water would begin to\nfreeze, but plants or vegetables would not.They would require slightly\nseverer cold to affect them.But as soon as the water begins to freeze it\nalso gradually gives out its latent heat, and before a particle of ice\ncan form it must give out one hundred and forty degrees of heat to the\nair and water around it.Therefore the freezing process goes on slowly,\nand both the air and water are kept comparatively warm.After a time,\nhowever, the ice becomes so thick over the surface that the freezing goes\non more and more slowly, because the latent heat in the unfrozen water\ncannot readily escape through the ice.It is therefore retained, just as\nthe latent heat in the water of an ice-covered pond is retained.\"\"It follows, then,\" said Leonard, \"that after the water beneath the ice\nin the tub began to freeze slowly, the flower-room, in that same degree,\nbegan to grow cold.\"\"Certainly, for only as the water freezes can it give out its latent\nheat.The thick wooden side of the tub is a poor conductor; the ice that\nhas formed over the surface is even a worse, and so the water within is\nshielded from the cold.It therefore almost ceases to freeze, and so\nbecomes of no practical use.An intelligent understanding of these\nprinciples is of great practical value.If I could have waked up and\nplaced another tub of water in the room at two or three o'clock, or else\ntaken all of the ice out of the first one, the process of freezing and\ngiving out heat would have gone on rapidly again, and none of the plants\nwould have suffered.I have heard people say that putting water in a\ncellar was all a humbug--that the water froze and the vegetables also.Of\ncourse the vegetables froze after the water congealed, or the cellar may\nhave been so defective that both froze at the same time.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.The latent heat\ngiven out by a small amount of freezing water cannot counteract any great\nseverity of frost.\"\"The more water you have, then, the better?\"\"Yes, for then there is more to freeze, and the effect is more gradual\nand lasting.\"\"I feel highly honored, Webb,\" said his mother, smiling, \"that so much\nscience should minister to me and my little collection of plants.I now\nsee that the why and wherefore comes in very usefully.But please tell me\nwhy you put the plants that were touched with frost into cold water, and\nwhy you will not let the sunlight fall on them?\"\"For the same reason that you would put your hand in cold water if\nfrost-bitten.Your expression, 'touched with frost,' shows that there is\nhope for them.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.If they were thoroughly frozen you would lose them.Your\nplants, you know, are composed chiefly of water, which fills innumerable\nlittle cells formed by the vegetable tissue.If the water in the cells is\nchilled beyond a certain point, if it becomes solid ice, it expands and\nbreaks down the tissue of the cells, and the structure of the plant is\ndestroyed.If the frost can be gradually withdrawn so as to leave the\ncells substantially intact, they can eventually resume their functions,\nand the plant receive no very great injury.\"\"But why does sudden heat or sunlight destroy a frosted plant?\"\"For the same reason that it breaks down the vegetable tissue.Heat\nexpands, and the greater the heat the more rapid the expansion.When the\nrays of the sun, which contain a great deal of heat, fall on any part of\na frost-bitten plant, that part begins to expand so rapidly and violently\nthat the cellular tissues are ruptured, and life is destroyed.What is\nmore, the heat does not permeate equally and at once the parts affected\nby frost.The part furthest away from the heat remains contracted, while\nthe parts receiving it expand rapidly and unequally, and this becomes\nanother cause for the breaking up of the vegetable tissue.The same\nprinciple is illustrated when we turn up the flame of a lamp suddenly.The glass next to the flame expands so rapidly that the other parts\ncannot keep pace, and so, as the result of unequal expansion, the chimney\ngoes to pieces.With this principle in mind, we seek to withdraw the\nfrost and to reapply the vivifying heat very gradually and equally to\nevery part, so that the vegetable tissues may be preserved unbroken.This\nis best done by immersing them in cold water, and then keeping them at a\nlow temperature in a shady place.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football there.As the various parts of the plant\nresume their functions, the light and heat essential to its life and\ngrowth can gradually be increased.\"\"It seems to me that your theory is at fault, Webb,\" said Leonard.\"How\nis it that some plants are able to endure such violent alternations of\nheat and cold?\"\"We don't have to go far--at least I do not--before coming to the\nlimitations of knowledge.What it is in the structure of a plant like the\n<DW29>, for instance, which makes it so much more hardy than others that\nseem stronger and more vigorous, even the microscope does not reveal.Nature has plenty of secrets that she has not yet told.But of all people\nin the world those who obtain their livelihood from the soil should seek\nto learn the wherefore of everything, for such knowledge often doubles\nthe prospect of success.\"\"Now, Amy,\" said Burtis, laughing, \"you see what sort of a fellow Webb\nis.You cannot even sneeze without his considering the wherefore back to\nthe remotest cause.\"Amy spent the greater part of the day in unpacking her trunks, and in\ngetting settled in her home-like room.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.It soon began to take on a familiar\nair.Hearts, like plants, strike root rapidly when the conditions are\nfavorable.Johnnie was her delighted assistant much of the time, and this\nChristmas-day was one long thrill of excitement to the child.Her wonder\ngrew and grew, for there was a foreign air about many of Amy's things, and,\nhaving been brought from such a long distance, they seemed to belong to\nanother world.The severe cold continued, and only the irrepressible Burtis\nventured out to any extent.When Alf's excitement over his presents began\nto flag, Webb helped him make two box-traps, and the boy concealed them in\nthe copse where the rabbit-tracks were thickest.Only the biting frost kept\nhim, in his intense eagerness, from remaining out to see the result.Webb,\nhowever, taught him patience by assuring him that watched traps never\ncaught game.Beyond the natural home festivities the day passed quietly, and this was\nalso true of the entire holiday season.Cheerfulness, happiness abounded,\nand there was an unobtrusive effort on the part of every one to surround\nthe orphan girl with a genial, sunny atmosphere.And yet she was ever\nmade to feel that her sorrow was remembered and respected.Clifford's mind was often busy with the memory of his friend, that\neven Burt declined invitations to country merrymakings in the vicinity,\nand that she was saved the ordeal of meeting gay young neighbors with\nwhom the Clifford home was a favorite resort.In brief, they had received\nher as a daughter of the house, and in many delicate ways proved that\nthey regarded her as entitled to the same consideration as if she were\none.Meanwhile she was shown that her presence cast no gloom over the\nfamily life, and she knew and they knew that it would be her father's\nwish that she should share in all the healing gladness of that life.No\ntrue friend who has passed on to the unclouded shore would wish to leave\nclouds and chilling shadows as a legacy, and they all felt that in Amy's\ncase it had been her father's desire and effort to place her under\nconditions that would develop her young life happily and therefore\nhealthfully.There is the widest difference in the world between\ncheerfulness and mirthfulness which arise from happy home life and\npeaceful hearts, and the levity that is at once unfeeling, inconsiderate,\nand a sure indication of a coarse-fibred, ill-bred nature.Amy was made\nto feel this, and she found little indeed which jarred with memories that\nwere only sad, not bitter or essentially depressing.Every day brought\nnew assurance that her father's wishes and hopes in her behalf had been\nfulfilled to a degree that must have added to his heavenly content, could\nhe have known how well he had provided for her.And so the busy days\nglided on; and when the evening brought the household together, there\nwere music, reading aloud, and genial family talk, which usually was\nlargely  by their rural calling.Therefore, on New-Year's morning\nAmy stood as upon a sunny eminence, and saw her path leading away amid\nscenes that promised usefulness, happiness, and content.CHAPTER VII\n\nNEIGHBORS DROP IN\n\n\nOne evening early in the year three neighbors dropped in.They were\nevidently as diverse in character as in appearance.The eldest was known\nin the neighborhood as Squire Bartley, having long been a justice of the\npeace.He was a large landholder, and carried on his farm in the\nold-fashioned ways, without much regard to system, order, or improvement.He had a big, good-natured red face, a stout, burly form, and a\ncorresponding voice.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.In marked contrast with his aspect and past\nexperience was Mr.Alvord, who was thin almost to emaciation, and upon\nwhose pallid face not only ill-health but deep mental suffering had left\ntheir unmistakable traces.He was a new-comer into the vicinity, and\nlittle was known of his past history beyond the fact that he had exchanged\ncity life for country pursuits in the hope of gaining strength and vigor.He ought to have been in the full prime of cheerful manhood, but his sombre\nface and dark, gloomy eyes indicated that something had occurred in the\npast which so deeply shadowed his life as to make its long continuance\ndoubtful.He had not reached middle age, and yet old Mr Clifford appeared a\nheartier man than he.While he had little knowledge of rural occupations,\nhe entered into them with eagerness, apparently finding them an antidote\nfor sad memories.He had little to say, but was a good listener, and\nevidently found at the Cliffords' a warmth and cheer coming not from the\nhearth only.Webb and Leonard had both been very kind to him in his\ninexperience, and an occasional evening at their fireside was the only\nsocial tendency that he had been known to indulge.Marvin, the third\nvisitor, might easily compete with Burt in flow of spirits, and in his day\nhad been quite as keen a sportsman.But he was unlike Burtis in this, that\nall birds were game to him, and for his purpose were always in season.To\nEmerson's line,\n\n  \"Hast thou named all the birds without a gun?\"he could not reply in the affirmative, and yet to kill as many as\npossible had never been his object.From earliest childhood he had\ndeveloped a taste for ornithology, and the study of the fauna of the\nregion had been almost his sole recreation for years.He too was a\nfrequent visitor at the Cliffords', where he ever found ready listeners\nand questioners.\"I don't know what is the matter with my poultry,\" Squire Bartley\nremarked, after the weather, politics, and harmless phases of local\ngossip had been discussed; \"they are getting as poor as crows.My boys\nsay that they are fed as well as usual.What's more, I've had them throw\ndown for 'em a warm mixture of meal and potatoes before they go to roost,\nbut we don't get an egg.\"Well, I don't know that I'm having much luck in the matter,\" Leonard\nreplied, with his humorous smile; \"but I can't complain.Until this very\ncold weather set in we had eggs in plenty, and still have a fair supply.I'm inclined to think that if your hens are the right kind, and are\nproperly cared for, they can't help producing eggs.I don't believe much in luck, but there are a few simple\nthings that are essential to success with poultry in winter.By the way,\ndo you give them well or spring water to drink?\"\"Well, no, I don't believe we do, at this time of year.I've so arranged\nit that the drippings from the eaves of the barn fall into a trough, and\nthat saves trouble.I expect the boys are careless, too, for I've seen\nthe fowls eating snow and ice.\"\"That accounts for your poultry being like crows, for, whatever the\nreason may be, snow-water will soon reduce chickens to mere feathers and\nbones.\"\"I don't think your system of feeding is the correct one, either,\"\npursued Leonard.\"You give your hens the warm meal to-morrow evening, as\nusual, and then about midnight go to the roosts and feel of their crops.The meal, you see, digests speedily,\nand is soon all gone.Then come the long cold hours before morning, and\nthe poor creatures have nothing to sustain them, and they become chilled\nand enfeebled.It takes some time for the grain you give them in the\nmorning to digest, and so they are left too long a time without support.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Give them the grain in the evening--corn and buckwheat and barley\nmixed--and there is something for their gizzards to act on all night\nlong.The birds are thus sustained and kept warm by their food.Then in\nthe morning, when they naturally feel the cold the most, give them the\nwarm food, mixing a little pepper with it during such weather as this.\"\"Well,\" remarked the squire, \"I guess you're right.One is apt to do things the same way year after year without much\nthought about it.\"\"Then, again,\" resumed Leonard, \"I find it pays to keep poultry warm,\nclean, and well sheltered.In very cold weather I let them out only for an\nhour or two.The rest of the time they are shut up in the chicken-house,\nwhich has an abundance of light, and is well ventilated.Beneath the floor\nof the chicken-house is a cellar, which I can fill with stable manure, and\ngraduate the heat by its fermentation.There is room in the cellar to turn the manure from time to time to prevent\nits becoming fire-fanged, so that there is no loss in this respect.Between\nthe heat from beneath, and the sun streaming in the windows on the south\nside of the house, I can keep my laying hens warm even in zero weather; and\nI make it a point not to have too many.Beyond a certain number, the more\nyou have the worse you're off, for poultry won't stand crowding.\"Marvin, \"are like the doctors, who kill or cure\ntoo much by rule and precedent.You get into certain ways or ruts, and\nstick to them.A little thought and observation would often greatly\nmodify your course.Now in regard to your poultry, you should remember\nthat they all existed once as nature made them--they were wild, and\ndomestication cannot wholly change their character.It seems to me that\nthe way to learn how to manage fowls successfully is to observe their\nhabits and modes of life when left to themselves.In summer, when they\nhave a range, we find them eating grass, seeds, insects, etc.In winter, when they can't get these things, they\nare often fed one or two kinds of grain continuously.Now, from their\nvery nature, they need in winter all the kinds of food that they\ninstinctively select when foraging for themselves--fresh vegetables,\nmeat, and varieties of seeds or grain.We give to our chickens all the\nrefuse from the kitchen--the varied food we eat ourselves, with the\nexception of that which contains a large percentage of salt--and they\nthrive and lay well.Before they are two years old we decapitate them.Old fowls, with rare exceptions, will not lay in winter.\"Alvord listened as if there were more consolation and cheer\nin this talk on poultry than in the counsel of sages.The \"chicken fever\"\nis more inevitable in a man's life than the chicken-pox, and sooner or\nlater all who are exposed succumb to it.Seeing the interest developing\nin his neighbor's face, Leonard said, briskly:\n\n\"Mr.Alvord, here's an investment that will pay you to consider.The care\nof poultry involves light and intelligent labor, and therefore is adapted\nto those who cannot well meet the rough and heavy phases of outdoor work.The fowls often become pets to their keepers, and the individual oddities\nand peculiarities of character form an amusing study which is not wanting\nin practical advantages.The majority of people keep ordinary barn-door\nfowls, which are the result of many breeds or strains.The consequence is\nalmost as great diversity of character within gallinaceous limits as\nexists in the families that care for them.For instance, one hen is a\ngood, persistent layer; another is a patient, brooding mother; a third is\nfickle, and leaves her nest so often and for such long intervals that the\neggs become chilled, and incubation ceases.Some are tame and tractable,\nothers as wild as hawks, and others still are not of much account in any\ndirection, and are like commonplace women, who are merely good to count\nwhen the census is taken.\"\"I hope you make no reference to present company,\" Maggie remarked.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Leonard gave his wife one of his humorous looks as he replied, \"I never\ncould admit that in regard to you, for it would prove too much against\nmyself.The idea of my picking out a commonplace woman!\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.And then with happy hearts they fly\n          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]\n\n    One night the Brownies stood beside\n    A long canal, whose silent tide\n    Connected seaboard cities great\n    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,\n    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;\n    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,\n    No mules were tugging on the shore;\n    All work on land and water too\n    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: \"We see, without a doubt,\n    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,\n    For even rates, or shorter day,\n    Has caused the boats to loiter here\n    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round\n    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,\n    Upon some kitchen-stove or range\n    To spread an odor rich and strange;\n    Those squashes, too, should not be lost\n    By long exposure to the frost,\n    When they would prove so great a prize\n    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,\n    From some fine orchard picked with care,\n                    Should not to rot and ruin go,\n                    Though work is hard or wages low,\n                    When thousands would be glad to stew\n                    The smallest apples there in view.\"[Illustration]\n\n    Another said: \"We lack the might\n    To set the wrongs of labor right,\n    But by the power within us placed\n    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied\n    That boats upon their way may glide.\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Then some ran here and there with speed\n    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about\n    The grassy banks, were fitted out\n                With straps and ropes without delay\n                To start the boats upon their way;\n                And next some straying goats were found,\n                Where in a yard they nibbled round\n                Destroying plants of rarest kind\n                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,\n    They found themselves in harness fast;\n    Then into active service pressed\n    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]\n\n    On deck some Brownies took their stand\n    To man the helm, or give command,\n    And oversee the work; while more\n    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along\n            And catch on snags or branches long,\n                    And cause delays they ill could bear,\n                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]\n\n            With accidents they often met,\n            And some were bruised and more were wet;\n            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;\n            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,\n            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,\n            When enterprises bold and new\n    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt\n    The work would still be carried out,\n    For extra strength would then be found\n    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout\n    They stood and stared or ran about\n    Till in the water, heels o'er head,\n    Some members of the band were spread.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    A few could swim, and held their own;\n    But more went downward like a stone\n    Until, without the plummet's aid,\n            They learned how deep canals are made.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.In spite of all the kicks and flings\n            That fright at such a moment brings,\n    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,\n    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team\n    Would pass along with sign and scream,\n    And those on land would know by this\n    That something startling was amiss;\n    And those on board could plainly see\n    Unless assistance there could be,\n    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,\n    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]\n\n    By chance a net was to be had,\n    That boatmen used for catching shad--\n    A gill-net of the strongest kind,\n    For heavy catches well designed;\n    Few shad against its meshes ran\n    But left their bones on some one's pan,\n    This bulky thing the active crew\n    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,\n    While others in its folds were bound,\n    Until like fish in great dismay\n    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,\n    And quickly from the muddy bed\n    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled\n    The dripping net was upward hauled,\n    With all the Brownies clinging fast,\n    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]\n\n                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road\n                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed\n    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,\n    With many strange mishaps the while,\n    But working bravely through the night\n    Until the city came in sight.Said one: \"Now, thanks to bearded goats\n    And patient m", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "But see, the sun's about to show\n    His colors to the world below,\n    And other birds than those of night\n    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;\n    The ebbing tide must do the rest;\n    Now drifting downward to their pier\n    Let barges unassisted steer,\n    While we make haste, with nimble feet,\n    To find in woods a safe retreat.\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee\n    A slumbering city by the sea.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.\"In yonder town,\" the leader cried,\n    \"I hear the artist does reside\n    Who pictures out, with patient hand,\n    The doings of the Brownie band.\"\"I'd freely give,\" another said,\n    \"The cap that now protects my head,\n    To find the room, where, day by day,\n    He shows us at our work or play.\"A third replied: \"Your cap retain\n    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,\n    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more\n    And soon we'll reach the office door.\"[Illustration]\n\n    Then through the park, around the square,\n    And down the broadest thoroughfare,\n    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,\n    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]\n\n        They paused awhile to view the sight,\n        To speak about its age and height,\n        And read the signs, so long and wide,\n        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,\n                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told\n                Their funny actions, free and bold,\n                Was honored by a friendly call\n                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Then what a gallery they found,\n                As here and there they moved around--\n                For now they gaze upon a scene\n                That showed them sporting on the green;\n                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed\n                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, \"Upon this desk, no doubt,\n                Where now we cluster round about,\n                Our doings have been plainly told\n    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,\n    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,\n    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold\n            That darksome liquid may unfold!\"[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            A telephone gave great delight\n            To those who tried it half the night,\n            Some asking after fresh supplies;\n    Or if their stocks were on the rise;\n    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;\n    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro\n    With \"Who are you?\"And all the repetitions known\n    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    \"Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,\"\n    Said one, \"that's written every line;\n    Indebted to this pen are we\n    For all our fame and history.\"\"See here,\" another said, \"I've found\n    The pointed pencil, long and round,\n    That pictures all our looks so wise,\n            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;\n            'Tis well it draws us all aright,\n            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name\n            In every region known to fame,\n            To know that children lisp our praise,\n            And on our faces love to gaze.\"Old pistols that brave service knew\n    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view\n    In mimic duels on the floor,\n    And snapped at paces three or four;\n    While from the foils the Brownies plied,\n    The sparks in showers scattered wide,\n    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,\n    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash\n    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,\n    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,\n    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]\n\n    They found old shields that bore the dint\n    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,\n    And held them up in proper pose;\n    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]\n\n    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,\n    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,\n    Until the laugh of comrades nigh\n    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,\n    Which every one could recognize:\n    The features, garments, and the style,\n    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,\n    And showed their skill was something rare;\n    While others talked and rummaged through\n    The desk to find the stories new,\n    That told about some late affair,\n    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power\n    To hasten every passing hour,\n    And bring too soon the morning chime,\n    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,\n    The startling hint of morning fell,\n    And Brownies realized the need\n    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street\n    They made their way with nimble feet,\n    And ere the sun could show his face,\n    The band had reached a hiding-place.It is true, as a general rule of the human mind, that the objects which\nmen have worshipped have improved in morality and wisdom as men\nthemselves have improved.The quiet gods, without effort of their own,\nhave grown holier and purer by the agitations and toil which civilise\ntheir worshippers.In other words, the same influences which elevate and\nwiden our sense of human duty give corresponding height and nobleness to\nour ideas of the divine character.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.The history of the civilisation of\nthe earth is the history of the civilisation of Olympus also.It will be\nseen that the deity whom De Maistre sets up is below the moral level of\nthe time in respect of Punishment.In intellectual matters he vehemently\nproclaimed the superiority of the tenth or the twelfth over the\neighteenth century, but it is surely carrying admiration for those loyal\ntimes indecently far, to seek in the vindictive sackings of revolted\ntowns, and the miscellaneous butcheries of men, women, and babes, which\nthen marked the vengeance of outraged sovereignty, the most apt parallel\nand analogy for the systematic administration of human society by its\nCreator.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.Such punishment can no longer be regarded as moral in any deep\nor permanent sense; it implies a gross, harsh, and revengeful character\nin the executioner, that is eminently perplexing and incredible to those\nwho expect to find an idea of justice in the government of the world, at\nleast not materially below what is attained in the clumsy efforts of\nuninspired publicists.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.In mere point of administration, the criminal code which De Maistre put\ninto the hands of the Supreme Being works in a more arbitrary and\ncapricious manner than any device of an Italian Bourbon.As Voltaire\nasks--\n\n    _Lisbonne, qui n'est plus, eut-elle plus de vices\n    Que Londres, que Paris, plonges dans les delices?Lisbonne est abimee, et l'on danse a Paris._\n\n\nStay, De Maistre replies, look at Paris thirty years later, not dancing,\nbut red with blood.This kind of thing is often said, even now; but it\nis really time to abandon the prostitution of the name of Justice to a\nprocess which brings Lewis XVI.to the block, and consigns De Maistre to\npoverty and exile, because Lewis XIV., the Regent, and Lewis XV.had\nbeen profligate men or injudicious rulers.The reader may remember how\nthe unhappy Emperor Maurice as his five innocent sons were in turn\nmurdered before his eyes, at each stroke piously ejaculated: 'Thou art\njust, O Lord!'[8] Any name would befit\nthis kind of transaction better than that which, in the dealings of men\nwith one another at least, we reserve for the honourable anxiety that he\nshould reap who has sown, that the reward should be to him who has\ntoiled for it, and the pain to him who has deliberately incurred it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.What is gained by attributing to the divine government a method tainted\nwith every quality that could vitiate the enactment of penalties by a\ntemporal sovereign?We need not labour this part of the discussion further.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.Though conducted\nwith much brilliance and vigour by De Maistre, it is not his most\nimportant nor remarkable contribution to thought.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Before passing on to\nthat, it is worth while to make one remark.It will be inferred from De\nMaistre's general position that he was no friend to physical science.Just as moderns see in the advance of the methods and boundaries of\nphysical knowledge the most direct and sure means of displacing the\nunfruitful subjective methods of old, and so of renovating the entire\nfield of human thought and activity, so did De Maistre see, as his\nschool has seen since, that here was the stronghold of his foes.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.'Ah,\nhow dearly,' he exclaimed, 'has man paid for the natural sciences!'Not\nbut that Providence designed that man should know something about them;\nonly it must be in due order.The ancients were not permitted to attain\nto much or even any sound knowledge of physics, indisputably above us as\nthey were in force of mind, a fact shown by the superiority of their\nlanguages which ought to silence for ever the voice of our modern pride.Why did the ancients remain so ignorant of natural science?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.'When all Europe was Christian, when the priests\nwere the universal teachers, when all the establishments of Europe were\nChristianised, when theology had taken its place at the head of all\ninstruction, and the other faculties were ranged around her like maids\nof honour round their queen, the human race being thus prepared, then\nthe natural sciences were given to it.'Science must be kept in its\nplace, for it resembles fire which, when confined in the grates prepared\nfor it, is the most useful and powerful of man's servants; scattered\nabout anyhow, it is the most terrible of scourges.Whence the marked\nsupremacy of the seventeenth century, especially in France?From the\nhappy accord of religion, science, and chivalry, and from the supremacy\nconceded to the first.The more perfect theology is in a country the\nmore fruitful it is in true science; and that is why Christian nations\nhave surpassed all others in the sciences, and that is why the Indians\nand Chinese will never reach us, so long as we remain respectively as we\nare.The more theology is cultivated, honoured, and supreme, then, other\nthings being equal, the more perfect will human science be: that is to\nsay, it will have the greater force and expansion, and will be the more\nfree from every mischievous and perilous connection.[9]\n\nLittle would be gained here by serious criticism of a view of this kind\nfrom a positive point.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.How little, the reader will understand from De\nMaistre's own explanations of his principles of Proof and Evidence.'They have called to witness against Moses,' he says, 'history,\nchronology, astronomy, geology, etc.The objections have disappeared\nbefore true science; but those were profoundly wise who despised them\nbefore any inquiry, or who only examined them in order to discover a\nrefutation, but without ever doubting that there was one.Even a\nmathematical objection ought to be despised, for though it may be a\ndemonstrated truth, still you will never be able to demonstrate that it\ncontradicts a truth that has been demonstrated before.'His final\nformula he boldly announced in these words: '_Que toutes les fois qu'une\nproposition sera prouvee par le genre de preuve qui lui appartient,\nl'objection quelconque,_ MEME INSOLUBLE, _ne doit plus etre ecoutee._'\nSuppose, for example, that by a consensus of testimony it were perfectly\nproved that Archimedes set fire to the fleet of Marcellus by a\nburning-glass; then all the objections of geometry disappear.Prove if\nyou can, and if you choose, that by certain laws a glass, in order to be\ncapable of setting fire to the Roman fleet, must have been as big as the\nwhole city of Syracuse, and ask me what answer I have to make to that.'_J'ai a vous repondre qu'Archimede brula la flotte romaine avec un\nmiroir ardent._'\n\nThe interesting thing about such opinions as these is not the exact\nheight and depth of their falseness, but the considerations which could\nrecommend them to a man of so much knowledge, both of books and of the\nouter facts of life, and of so much natural acuteness as De Maistre.Persons who have accustomed themselves to ascertained methods of proof,\nare apt to look on a man who vows that if a thing has been declared\ntrue by some authority whom he respects, then that constitutes proof to\nhim, as either the victim of a preposterous and barely credible\ninfatuation, or else as a flat impostor.Yet De Maistre was no ignorant\nmonk.He had no selfish or official interest in taking away the\nkeys of knowledge, entering not in himself, and them that would\nenter in hindering.The true reasons for his detestation of the\neighteenth-century philosophers, science, and literature, are simple\nenough.Like every wise man, he felt that the end of all philosophy and\nscience is emphatically social, the construction and maintenance and\nimprovement of a fabric under which the communities of men may find\nshelter, and may secure all the conditions for living their lives with\ndignity and service.Then he held that no truth can be harmful to\nsociety.If he found any system of opinions, any given attitude of the\nmind, injurious to tranquillity and the public order, he instantly\nconcluded that, however plausible they might seem when tested by logic\nand demonstration, they were fundamentally untrue and deceptive.What is\nlogic compared with eternal salvation in the next world, and the\npractice of virtue in this?The recommendation of such a mind as De\nMaistre's is the intensity of its appreciation of order and social\nhappiness.The obvious weakness of such a mind, and the curse inherent\nin its influence, is that it overlooks the prime condition of all; that\nsocial order can never be established on a durable basis so long as the\ndiscoveries of scientific truth in all its departments are suppressed,\nor incorrectly appreciated, or socially misapplied.De Maistre did not\nperceive that the cause which he supported was no longer the cause of\npeace and tranquillity and right living, but was in a state of absolute\nand final decomposition, and therefore was the cause of disorder and\nblind wrong living.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[3] _Soirees de Saint Petersbourg_ (8th ed.[4] _Soirees de Saint Petersbourg, 6ieme entretien_, i.[5] _Ib._ (8th ed.[6] _Soirees_, i.76\n\n[7] De Maistre found a curiously characteristic kind of support for this\nview in the fact that evils are called _fleaux_: flails are things to\nbeat with: so evils must be things with which men are beaten; and as we\nshould not be beaten if we did not deserve it, _argal_, suffering is a\nmerited punishment.Apart from that common infirmity which leads people\nafter they have discovered an analogy between two things, to argue from\nthe properties of the one to those of the other, as if, instead of being\nanalogous, they were identical, De Maistre was particularly fond of\ninferring moral truths from etymologies.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.He has an argument for the\ndeterioration of man, drawn from the fact that the Romans expressed in\nthe same word, _supplicium_, the two ideas of prayer and punishment\n(_Soirees, 2ieme entretien_, i. p.His profundity as an\netymologist may be gathered from his analysis of _cadaver_: _ca_-ro,\n_da_-ta, _ver_-mibus.[8] _Gibbon_, c. xlvi.[9] See the _Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon_, vol.When the waters of the deluge of '89 began to assuage, the best minds\nsoon satisfied themselves that the event which Bonaparte's restoration\nof order enabled them to look back upon with a certain tranquillity and\na certain completeness, had been neither more nor less than a new\nirruption of barbarians into the European world.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.The monarchy, the\nnobles, and the Church, with all the ideas that gave each of them life\nand power, had fallen before atheists and Jacobins, as the ancient\nempire of Rome had fallen before Huns and Goths, Vandals and Lombards.The leaders of the revolution had succeeded one another, as Attila had\ncome after Alaric, and as Genseric had been followed by Odoacer.The\nproblem which presented itself was not new in the history of western\ncivilisation; the same dissolution of old bonds which perplexed the\nforemost men at the beginning of the nineteenth century, had distracted\ntheir predecessors from the fifth to the eighth, though their conditions\nand circumstances were widely different.The practical question in both\ncases was just the same--how to establish a stable social order which,\nresting on principles that should command the assent of all, might\nsecure the co-operation of all for its harmonious and efficient\nmaintenance, and might offer a firm basis for the highest and best life\nthat the moral and intellectual state of the time allowed.There were\ntwo courses open, or which seemed to be open, in this gigantic\nenterprise of reconstructing a society.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.One of them was to treat the\ncase of the eighteenth century as if it were not merely similar to, but\nexactly identical with, the case of the fifth, and as if exactly the\nsame forces which had knit Western Europe together into a compact\ncivilisation a thousand years before, would again suffice for a second\nconsolidation.Christianity, rising with the zeal and strength of youth\nout of the ruins of the Empire, and feudalism by the need of\nself-preservation imposing a form upon the unshapen associations of the\nbarbarians, had between them compacted the foundations and reared the\nfabric of mediaeval life.Why, many men asked themselves, should not\nChristian and feudal ideas repeat their great achievement, and be the\nmeans of reorganising the system which a blind rebellion against them\nhad thrown into deplorable and fatal confusion?Let the century which\nhad come to such an end be regarded as a mysteriously intercalated\nepisode, and no more, in the long drama of faith and sovereign order.Let it pass as a sombre and pestilent stream, whose fountains no man\nshould discover, whose waters had for a season mingled with the mightier\ncurrent of the divinely allotted destiny of the race, and had then\ngathered themselves apart and flowed off, to end as they had begun, in\nthe stagnation and barrenness of the desert.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Philosophers and men of\nletters, astronomers and chemists, atheists and republicans, had shown\nthat they were only powerful to destroy, as the Goths and the Vandals\nhad been.They had shown that they were impotent, as the Goths and the\nVandals had been, in building up again.Let men turn their faces, then,\nonce more to that system by which in the ancient times Europe had been\ndelivered from a relapse into eternal night.The minds to whom it\ncommended itself were cast in a different mould and drew their\ninspiration from other traditions.In their view the system which the\nChurch had been the main agency in organising, had fallen quite as much\nfrom its own irremediable weakness as from the direct onslaughts of\nassailants within and without.The barbarians had rushed in, it was\ntrue, in 1793; but this time it was the Church and feudalism which were\nin the position of the old empire on whose ruins they had built.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.What\nhad once restored order and belief to the West, was now in its own turn\novertaken by decay and dissolution.To look to them to unite these new\nbarbarians in a stable and vigorous civilisation, because they had\norganised Europe of old, was as infatuated as it would have been to\nexpect the later emperors to equal the exploits of the Republic and\ntheir greatest predecessors in the purple.To despise philosophers and\nmen of science was only to play over again in a new dress the very part\nwhich Julian had enacted in the face of nascent Christianity.The\neighteenth century, instead of being that home of malaria which the\nCatholic and Royalist party represented, was in truth the seed-ground of\na new and better future.Its ideas were to furnish the material and the\nimplements by which should be repaired the terrible breaches and chasms\nin European order that had been made alike by despots and Jacobins, by\npriests and atheists, by aristocrats and sans-culottes.Amidst all the\ndemolition upon which its leading minds had been so zealously bent, they\nhad been animated by the warmest love of social justice, of human\nfreedom, of equal rights, and by the most fervent and sincere longing to\nmake a nobler happiness more universally attainable by all the children\nof men.It was to these great principles that we ought eagerly to turn,\nto liberty, to equality, to brotherhood, if we wished to achieve before\nthe new invaders a work of civilisation and social reconstruction, such\nas Catholicism and feudalism had achieved for the multitudinous invaders\nof old.Such was the difference which divided opinion when men took heart to\nsurvey the appalling scene of moral desolation that the cataclysm of '93\nhad left behind.For if the\nconscience of the Liberals was oppressed by the sanguinary tragedy in\nwhich freedom and brotherhood and justice had been consummated, the\nCatholic and the Royalist were just as sorely burdened with the weight\nof kingly basenesses and priestly hypocrisies.If the one had some\ndifficulty in interpreting Jacobinism and the Terror, the other was\nstill more severely pressed to interpret the fact and origin and meaning\nof the Revolution; if the Liberal had Marat and Hebert, the Royalist had\nLewis XV., and the Catholic had Dubois and De Rohan.Each school could\nintrepidly hurl back the taunts of its enemy, and neither of them did\nfull justice to the strong side of the other.Yet we who are, in England\nat all events, removed a little aside from the centre of this great\nbattle, may perceive that at that time both of the contending hosts\nfought under honourable banners, and could inscribe upon their shields a\nrational and intelligible device.Indeed, unless the modern Liberal\nadmits the strength inherent in the cause of his enemies, it is\nimpossible for him to explain to himself the duration and obstinacy of\nthe conflict, the slow advance and occasional repulse of the host in\nwhich he has enlisted, and the tardy progress that Liberalism has made\nin that stupendous reconstruction which the Revolution has forced the\nmodern political thinker to meditate upon, and the modern statesman to\nfurther and control.De Maistre, from those general ideas as to the method of the government\nof the world, of which we have already seen something, had formed what\nhe conceived to be a perfectly satisfactory way of accounting for the\neighteenth century and its terrific climax.The will of man is left\nfree; he acts contrary to the will of God; and then God exacts the\nshedding of blood as the penalty.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.The only hope of\nthe future lay in an immediate return to the system which God himself\nhad established, and in the restoration of that spiritual power which\nhad presided over the reconstruction of Europe in darker and more\nchaotic times than even these.Though, perhaps, he nowhere expresses\nhimself on this point in a distinct formula, De Maistre was firmly\nimpressed with the idea of historic unity and continuity.He looked upon\nthe history of the West in its integrity, and was entirely free from\nanything like that disastrous kind of misconception which makes the\nEnglish Protestant treat the long period between St.Paul and Martin\nLuther as a howling waste, or which makes some Americans omit from all\naccount the still longer period of human effort from the crucifixion of\nChrist to the Declaration of Independence.The rise of the vast\nstructure of Western civilisation during and after the dissolution of\nthe Empire, presented itself to his mind as a single and uniform\nprocess, though marked in portions by temporary, casual, parenthetical\ninterruptions, due to depraved will and disordered pride.All the\ndangers to which this civilisation had been exposed in its infancy and\ngrowth were before his eyes.First, there were the heresies with which\nthe subtle and debased ingenuity of the Greeks had stained and distorted\nthe great but simple mysteries of the faith.Then came the hordes of\ninvaders from the North, sweeping with irresistible force over regions\nthat the weakness or cowardice of the wearers of the purple left\ndefenceless before them.Before the northern tribes had settled in their\npossessions, and had full time to assimilate the faith and the\ninstitutions which they had found there, the growing organisation was\nmenaced by a more deadly peril in the incessant and steady advance of\nthe bloody and fanatical tribes from the East.And in this way De\nMaistre's mind continued the picture down to the latest days of all,\nwhen there had arisen men who, denying God and mocking at Christ, were\nbent on the destruction of the very foundations of society, and had\nnothing better to offer the human race than a miserable return to a\nstate of nature.As he thus reproduced this long drama, one benign and central figure was\never present, changeless in the midst of ceaseless change; laboriously\nbuilding up with preterhuman patience and preterhuman sagacity, when\nother powers, one after another in evil succession, were madly raging to\ndestroy and to pull down; thinking only of the great interests of order\nand civilisation, of which it had been constituted the eternal\nprotector, and showing its divine origin and inspiration alike by its\nunfailing wisdom and its unfailing benevolence.It is the Sovereign\nPontiff who thus stands forth throughout the history of Europe, as the\ngreat Demiurgus of universal civilisation.If the Pope had filled only\nsuch a position as the Patriarch held at Constantinople, or if there had\nbeen no Pope, and Christianity had depended exclusively on the East for\nits propagation, with no great spiritual organ in the West, what would\nhave become of Western development?It was the energy and resolution of\nthe Pontiffs which resisted the heresies of the East, and preserved to\nthe Christian religion that plainness and intelligibility, without which\nit would never have made a way to the rude understanding and simple\nhearts of the barbarians from the North.It was their wise patriotism\nwhich protected Italy against Greek oppression, and by acting the part\nof mayors of the palace to the decrepit Eastern emperors, it was they\nwho contrived to preserve the independence and maintain the fabric of\nsociety until the appearance of the Carlovingians, in whom, with the\nrapid instinct of true statesmen, they at once recognised the founders\nof a new empire of the West.If the Popes, again, had possessed over the\nEastern empire the same authority that they had over the Western, they\nwould have repulsed not only the Saracens, but the Turks too, and none\nof the evils which these nations have inflicted on us would ever have\ntaken place.[10] Even as it was, when the Saracens threatened the West,\nthe Popes were the chief agents in organising resistance, and giving\nspirit and animation to the defenders of Europe.Their alert vision saw\nthat to crush for ever that formidable enemy, it was not enough to\ndefend ourselves against his assaults; we must attack him at home.The\nCrusades, vulgarly treated as the wars of a blind and superstitious\npiety, were in truth wars of high policy.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk there.From the Council of Clermont\ndown to the famous day of Lepanto, the hand and spirit of the Pontiff\nwere to be traced in every part of that tremendous struggle which\nprevented Europe from being handed over to the tyranny, ignorance, and\nbarbarism that have always been the inevitable fruits of Mahometan\nconquest, and had already stamped out civilisation in Asia Minor and\nPalestine and Greece, once the very garden of the universe.This admirable and politic heroism of the Popes in the face of foes\npressing from without, De Maistre found more than equalled by their\nwisdom, courage, and activity in organising and developing the elements\nof a civilised system within.The maxim of old societies had been that\nwhich Lucan puts into the mouth of Caesar--_humanum paucis vivit genus_.A vast population of slaves had been one of the inevitable social\nconditions of the period: the Popes never rested from their endeavours\nto banish servitude from among Christian nations.Women in old\nsocieties had filled a mean and degraded place: it was reserved for the\nnew spiritual power to rescue the race from that vicious circle in which\nmen had debased the nature of women, and women had given back all the\nweakness and perversity they had received from men, and to perceive that\n'the most effectual way of perfecting the man is to ennoble and exalt\nthe woman.'The organisation of the priesthood, again, was a masterpiece\nof practical wisdom.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.Such an order, removed from the fierce or selfish\ninterests of ordinary life by the holy regulation of celibacy, and by\nthe austere discipline of the Church, was indispensable in the midst of\nsuch a society as that which it was the function of the Church to guide.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Who but the members of an order thus set apart, acting in strict\nsubordination to the central power, and so presenting a front of\nunbroken spiritual unity, could have held their way among tumultuous\ntribes, half-barbarous nobles, and proud and unruly kings, protesting\nagainst wrong, passionately inculcating new and higher ideas of right,\ndenouncing the darkness of the false gods, calling on all men to worship\nthe cross and adore the mysteries of the true God?Compare now the\nimpotency of the Protestant missionary, squatting in gross comfort with\nwife and babes among the savages he has come to convert, preaching a\ndisputatious doctrine, wrangling openly with the rival sent by some\nother sect--compare this impotency with the success that follows the\ndevoted sons of the Church, impressing their proselytes with the\nmysterious virtue of their continence, the self-denial of their lives,\nthe unity of their dogma and their rites; and then recognise the wisdom\nof these great churchmen who created a priesthood after this manner in\nthe days when every priest was as the missionary is now.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Finally, it was\nthe occupants of the holy chair who prepared, softened, one might almost\nsay sweetened, the occupants of thrones; it was to them that Providence\nhad confided the education of the sovereigns of Europe.The Popes\nbrought up the youth of the European monarchy; they made it precisely in\nthe same way in which Fenelon made the Duke of Burgundy.In each case\nthe task consisted in eradicating from a fine character an element of\nferocity that would have ruined all.'Everything that constrains a man\nstrengthens him.He cannot obey without perfecting himself; and by the\nmere fact of overcoming himself he is better.Any man will vanquish the\nmost violent passion at thirty, because at five or six you have taught\nhim of his own will to give up a plaything or a sweetmeat.That came to\npass to the monarchy, which happens to an individual who has been well\nbrought up.The continued efforts of the Church, directed by the\nSovereign Pontiff, did what had never been seen before, and what will\nnever be seen again where that authority is not recognised.Insensibly,\nwithout threats or laws or battles, without violence and without\nresistance, the great European charter was proclaimed, not on paper nor\nby the voice of public criers; but in all European hearts, then all\nCatholic Kings surrender the power of judging by themselves, and nations\nin return declare kings infallible and inviolable.Such is the\nfundamental law of the European monarchy, and it is the work of the\nPopes.'[11]\n\nAll this, however, is only the external development of De Maistre's\ncentral idea, the historical corroboration of a truth to which he\nconducts us in the first instance by general considerations.Assuming,\nwhat it is less and less characteristic of the present century at any\nrate to deny, that Christianity was the only actual force by which the\nregeneration of Europe could be effected after the decline of the Roman\ncivilisation, he insists that, as he again and again expresses it,\n'without the Pope there is no veritable Christianity.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.What he meant by\nthis condensed form needs a little explanation, as is always the case\nwith such simple statements of the products of long and complex\nreasoning.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.In saying that without the Pope there is no true\nChristianity, what he considered himself as having established was, that\nunless there be some supreme and independent possessor of authority to\nsettle doctrine, to regulate discipline, to give authentic counsel, to\napply accepted principles to disputed cases, then there can be no such\nthing as a religious system which shall have power to bind the members\nof a vast and not homogeneous body in the salutary bonds of a common\ncivilisation, nor to guide and inform an universal conscience.In each\nindividual state everybody admits the absolute necessity of having some\nsovereign power which shall make, declare, and administer the", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.In free\nEngland, as in despotic Turkey, the privileges and obligations which the\nlaw tolerates or imposes, and all the benefits which their existence\nconfers on the community, are the creatures and conditions of a supreme\nauthority from which there is no appeal, whether the instrument by which\nthis authority makes its will known be an act of parliament or a ukase.This conception of temporal sovereignty, especially familiarised to our\ngeneration by the teaching of Austin, was carried by De Maistre into\ndiscussions upon the limits of the Papal power with great ingenuity and\nforce, and, if we accept the premisses, with great success.It should be said here, that throughout his book on the Pope, De Maistre\ntalks of Christianity exclusively as a statesman or a publicist would\ntalk about it; not theologically nor spiritually, but politically and\nsocially.The question with which he concerns himself is the utilisation\nof Christianity as a force to shape and organise a system of civilised\nsocieties; a study of the conditions under which this utilisation had\ntaken place in the earlier centuries of the era; and a deduction from\nthem of the conditions under which we might ensure a repetition of the\nprocess in changed modern circumstance.In the eighteenth century men\nwere accustomed to ask of Christianity, as Protestants always ask of so\nmuch of Catholicism as they have dropped, whether or no it is true.But\nafter the Revolution the question changed, and became an inquiry whether\nand how Christianity could contribute to the reconstruction of society.People asked less how true it was, than how strong it was; less how many\nunquestioned dogmas, than how much social weight it had or could\ndevelop; less as to the precise amount and form of belief that would\nsave a soul, than as to the way in which it might be expected to assist\nthe European community.It was the strength of this temper in him which led to his extraordinary\ndetestation and contempt for the Greeks.Their turn for pure speculation\nexcited all his anger.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.In a curious chapter, he exhausts invective in\ndenouncing them.[12] The sarcasm of Sallust delights him, that the\nactions of Greece were very fine, _verum aliquanto minores quam fama\nferuntur_.Their military glory was only a flash of about a hundred and\nfourteen years from Marathon; compare this with the prolonged splendour\nof Rome, France, and England.In philosophy they displayed decent\ntalent, but even here their true merit is to have brought the wisdom of\nAsia into Europe, for they invented nothing.Greece was the home of\nsyllogism and of unreason.'Read Plato: at every page you will draw a\nstriking distinction.As often as he is Greek, he wearies you.He is\nonly great, sublime, penetrating, when he is a theologian; in other\nwords, when he is announcing positive and everlasting dogmas, free from\nall quibble, and which are so clearly marked with the eastern cast, that\nnot to perceive it one must never have had a glimpse of Asia.... There\nwas in him a sophist and a theologian, or, if you choose, a Greek and a\nChaldean.'The Athenians could never pardon one of their great leaders,\nall of whom fell victims in one shape or another to a temper frivolous\nas that of a child, ferocious as that of men,--'_espece de moutons\nenrages, toujours menes par la nature, et toujours par nature devorant\nleurs bergers_.'As for their oratory, 'the tribune of Athens would have\nbeen the disgrace of mankind if Phocion and men like him, by\noccasionally ascending it before drinking the hemlock or setting out for\ntheir place of exile, had not in some sort balanced such a mass of\nloquacity, extravagance, and cruelty.'[13]\n\nIt is very important to remember this constant solicitude for ideas that\nshould work well, in connection with that book of De Maistre's which\nhas had most influence in Europe, by supplying a base for the theories\nof ultramontanism.Unless we perceive very clearly that throughout his\nardent speculations on the Papal power his mind was bent upon enforcing\nthe practical solution of a pressing social problem, we easily\nmisunderstand him and underrate what he had to say.A charge has been\nforcibly urged against him by an eminent English critic, for example,\nthat he has confounded supremacy with infallibility, than which, as the\nwriter truly says, no two ideas can be more perfectly distinct, one\nbeing superiority of force, and the other incapacity of error.[14] De\nMaistre made logical blunders in abundance quite as bad as this, but he\nwas too acute, I think, deliberately to erect so elaborate a structure\nupon a confusion so very obvious, and that must have stared him in the\nface from the first page of his work to the last.If we look upon his\nbook as a mere general defence of the Papacy, designed to investigate\nand fortify all its pretensions one by one, we should have great right\nto complain against having two claims so essentially divergent, treated\nas though they were the same thing, or could be held in their places by\nthe same supports.But let us regard the treatise on the Pope not as\nmeant to convince free-thinkers or Protestants that divine grace\ninspires every decree of the Holy Father, though that would have been\nthe right view of it if it had been written fifty years earlier.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.It was\ncomposed within the first twenty years of the present century, when the\nuniverse, to men of De Maistre's stamp, seemed once more without form\nand void.His object, as he tells us more than once, was to find a way\nof restoring a religion and a morality in Europe; of giving to truth the\nforces demanded for the conquests that she was meditating; of\nstrengthening the thrones of sovereigns, and of gently calming that\ngeneral fermentation of spirit which threatened mightier evils than any\nthat had yet overwhelmed society.From this point of view we shall see\nthat the distinction between supremacy and infallibility was not worth\nrecognising.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.Practically, he says, 'infallibility is only a consequence of supremacy,\nor rather it is absolutely the same thing under two different names....\nIn effect it is the same thing, _in practice_, not to be subject to\nerror, and not to be liable to be accused of it.Thus, even if we should\nagree that no divine promise was made to the Pope, he would not be less\ninfallible or deemed so, as the final tribunal; for every judgment from\nwhich you cannot appeal is and must be (_est et doit etre_) held for\njust in every human association, under any imaginable form of\ngovernment; and every true statesman will understand me perfectly, when\nI say that the point is to ascertain not only if the Sovereign Pontiff\nis, but if he must be, infallible.'[15] In another place he says\ndistinctly enough that the infallibility of the Church has two aspects;\nin one of them it is the object of divine promise, in the other it is a\nhuman implication, and that in the latter aspect infallibility is\nsupposed in the Church, just 'as we are absolutely bound to suppose it,\neven in temporal sovereignties (where it does not really exist), under\npain of seeing society dissolved.'The Church only demands what other\nsovereignties demand, though she has the immense superiority over them\nof having her claim backed by direct promise from heaven.[16] Take away\nthe dogma, if you will, he says, and only consider the thing\npolitically, which is exactly what he really does all through the book.The pope, from this point of view, asks for no other infallibility than\nthat which is attributed to all sovereigns.[17] Without either\nvindicating or surrendering the supernatural side of the Papal claims,\nhe only insists upon the political, social, or human side of it, as an\ninseparable quality of an admitted supremacy.[18] In short, from\nbeginning to end of this speculation, from which the best kind of\nultramontanism has drawn its defence, he evinces a deprecatory\nanxiety--a very rare temper with De Maistre--not to fight on the issue\nof the dogma of infallibility over which Protestants and unbelievers\nhave won an infinite number of cheap victories; that he leaves as a\ntheme more fitted for the disputations of theologians.My position, he\nseems to keep saying, is that if the Pope is spiritually supreme, then\nhe is virtually and practically _as if he were_ infallible, just in the\nsame sense in which the English Parliament and monarch, and the Russian\nCzar, are as if they were infallible.But let us not argue so much about\nthis, which is only secondary.The main question is whether without the\nPope there can be a true Christianity, 'that is to say, a Christianity,\nactive, powerful, converting, regenerating, conquering, perfecting.'De Maistre was probably conducted to his theory by an analogy, which he\ntacitly leaned upon more strongly than it could well bear, between\ntemporal organisation and spiritual organisation.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.In inchoate\ncommunities, the momentary self-interest and the promptly stirred\npassions of men would rend the growing society in pieces, unless they\nwere restrained by the strong hand of law in some shape or other,\nwritten or unwritten, and administered by an authority, either\nphysically too strong to be resisted, or else set up by the common\nconsent seeking to further the general convenience.To divide this\nauthority, so that none should know where to look for a sovereign\ndecree, nor be able to ascertain the commands of sovereign law; to\nembody it in the persons of many discordant expounders, each assuming\noracular weight and equal sanction; to leave individuals to administer\nand interpret it for themselves, and to decide among themselves its\napplication to their own cases; what would this be but a deliberate\npreparation for anarchy and dissolution?For it is one of the clear\nconditions of the efficacy of the social union, that every member of it\nshould be able to know for certain the terms on which he belongs to it,\nthe compliances which it will insist upon in him, and the compliances\nwhich it will in turn permit him to insist upon in others, and therefore\nit is indispensable that there should be some definite and admitted\ncentre where this very essential knowledge should be accessible.Some such reflections as these must have been at the bottom of De\nMaistre's great apology for the Papal supremacy, or at any rate they may\nserve to bring before our minds with greater clearness the kind of\nfoundations on which his scheme rested.For law substitute Christianity,\nfor social union spiritual union, for legal obligations the obligations\nof the faith.Instead of individuals bound together by allegiance to\ncommon political institutions, conceive communities united in the bonds\nof religious brotherhood into a sort of universal republic, under the\nmoderate supremacy of a supreme spiritual power.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.As a matter of fact, it\nwas the intervention of this spiritual power which restrained the\nanarchy, internal and external, of the ferocious and imperfectly\norganised sovereignties that figure in the early history of modern\nEurope.And as a matter of theory, what could be more rational and\ndefensible than such an intervention made systematic, with its\nrightfulness and disinterestedness universally recognised?<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.Grant\nChristianity as the spiritual basis of the life and action of modern\ncommunities; supporting both the organised structure of each of them,\nand the interdependent system composed of them all; accepted by the\nindividual members of each, and by the integral bodies forming the\nwhole.But who shall declare what the Christian doctrine is, and how its\nmaxims bear upon special cases, and what oracles they announce in\nparticular sets of circumstances?Amid the turbulence of popular\npassion, in face of the crushing despotism of an insensate tyrant,\nbetween the furious hatred of jealous nations or the violent ambition of\nrival sovereigns, what likelihood would there be of either party to the\ncontention yielding tranquilly and promptly to any presentation of\nChristian teaching made by the other, or by some suspected neutral as a\ndecisive authority between them?Obviously there must be some supreme\nand indisputable interpreter, before whose final decree the tyrant\nshould quail, the flood of popular lawlessness flow back within its\naccustomed banks, and contending sovereigns or jealous nations\nfraternally embrace.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Again, in those questions of faith and discipline,\nwhich the ill-exercised ingenuity of men is for ever raising and\npressing upon the attention of Christendom, it is just as obvious that\nthere must be some tribunal to pronounce an authoritative judgment.Otherwise, each nation is torn into sects; and amid the throng of sects\nwhere is unity?'To maintain that a crowd of independent churches form a\nchurch, one and universal, is to maintain in other terms that all the\npolitical governments of Europe only form a single government, one and\nuniversal.'There could no more be a kingdom of France without a king,\nnor an empire of Russia without an emperor, than there could be one\nuniversal church without an acknowledged head.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.That this head must be\nthe successor of St.Peter, is declared alike by the voice of tradition,\nthe explicit testimony of the early writers, the repeated utterances of\nlater theologians of all schools, and that general sentiment which\npresses itself upon every conscientious reader of religious history.The argument that the voice of the Church is to be sought in general\ncouncils is absurd.To maintain that a council has any other function\nthan to assure and certify the Pope, when he chooses to strengthen his\njudgment or to satisfy his doubts, is to destroy visible unity.Suppose\nthere to be an equal division of votes, as happened in the famous case\nof Fenelon, and might as well happen in a general council, the doubt\nwould after all be solved by the final vote of the Pope.And 'what is\ndoubtful for twenty selected men is doubtful for the whole human race.Those who suppose that by multiplying the deliberating voices doubt is\nlessened, must have very little knowledge of men, and can never have sat\nin a deliberative body.'Again, supposing there to present itself one of\nthose questions of divine metaphysics that it is absolutely necessary to\nrefer to the decision of the supreme tribunal.Then our interest is not\nthat it should be decided in such or such a manner, but that it should\nbe decided without delay and without appeal.Besides, the world is now\ngrown too vast for general councils, which seem to be made only for the\nyouth of Christianity.In fine, why pursue futile or mischievous\ndiscussions as to whether the Pope is above the Council or the Council\nabove the Pope?In ordinary questions in which a king is conscious of\nsufficient light, he decides them himself, while the others in which he\nis not conscious of this light, he transfers to the States-General\npresided over by himself, but he is equally sovereign in either case.Let us be content to know, in the words\nof Thomassin,[19] that 'the Pope in the midst of his Council is above\nhimself, and that the Council decapitated of its chief is below him.'The point so constantly dwelt upon by Bossuet, the obligation of the\ncanons upon the Pope, was of very little worth in De Maistre's judgment,\nand he almost speaks with disrespect of the great Catholic defender for\nbeing so prolix and pertinacious in elaborating it.Here again he finds\nin Thomassin the most concise statement of what he held to be the true\nview, just as he does in the controversy as to the relative superiority\nof the Pope or the Council.'There is only an apparent contradiction,'\nsays Thomassin, 'between saying that the Pope is above the canons, and\nthat he is bound by them; that he is master of the canons, or that he is\nnot.Those who place him above the canons or make him their master, only\npretend that he _has a dispensing power over them_; while those who deny\nthat he is above the canons or is their master, mean no more than that\n_he can only exercise a dispensing power for the convenience and in the\nnecessities of the Church_.'This is an excellent illustration of the\nthoroughly political temper in which De Maistre treats the whole\nsubject.He looks at the power of the Pope over the canons much as a\nmodern English statesman looks at the question of the coronation oath,\nand the extent to which it binds the monarch to the maintenance of the\nlaws existing at the time of its imposition.In the same spirit he\nbanishes from all account the crowd of nonsensical objections to Papal\nsupremacy, drawn from imaginary possibilities.Suppose a Pope, for\nexample, were to abolish all the canons at a single stroke; suppose him\nto become an unbeliever; suppose him to go mad; and so forth.'Why,' De\nMaistre says, 'there is not in the whole world a single power in a\ncondition to bear all possible and arbitrary hypotheses of this sort;\nand if you judge them by what they can do, without speaking of what they\nhave done, they will have to be abolished every one.'[20] This, it may\nbe worth noticing, is one of the many passages in De Maistre's writings\nwhich, both in the solidity of their argument and the direct force of\ntheir expression, recall his great predecessor in the anti-revolutionary\ncause, the ever-illustrious Burke.The vigour with which De Maistre sums up all these pleas for supremacy\nis very remarkable; and to the crowd of enemies and indifferents, and\nespecially to the statesmen who are among them, he appeals with\nadmirable energy.Do you mean that the nations\nshould live without any religion, and do you not begin to perceive that\na religion there must be?And does not Christianity, not only by its\nintrinsic worth but because it is in possession, strike you as\npreferable to every other?Have you been better contented with other\nattempts in this way?Peradventure the twelve apostles might please you\nbetter than the Theophilanthropists and Martinists?Does the Sermon on\nthe Mount seem to you a passable code of morals?And if the entire\npeople were to regulate their conduct on this model, should you be\ncontent?I fancy that I hear you reply affirmatively.Well, since the\nonly object now is to maintain this religion for which you thus declare\nyour preference, how could you have, I do not say the stupidity, but the\ncruelty, to turn it into a democracy, and to place this precious deposit\nin the hands of the rabble?'You attach too much importance to the dogmatic part of this religion.By what strange contradiction would you desire to agitate the universe\nfor some academic quibble, for miserable wranglings about mere words\n(these are your own terms)?Will you\ncall the Bishop of Quebec and the Bishop of Lucon to interpret a line of\nthe Catechism?<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.That believers should quarrel about infallibility is what\nI know, for I see it; but that statesmen should quarrel in the same way\nabout this great privilege, is what I shall never be able to\nconceive.... That all the bishops in the world should be convoked to\ndetermine a divine truth necessary to salvation--nothing more natural,\nif such a method is indispensable; for no effort, no trouble, ought to\nbe spared for so exalted an aim.But if the only point is the\nestablishment of one opinion in the place of another, then the\ntravelling expenses of even one single Infallible are sheer waste.If\nyou want to spare the two most valuable things on earth, time and money,\nmake all haste to write to Rome, in order to procure thence a lawful\ndecision which shall declare the unlawful doubt.Nothing more is needed;\npolicy asks no more.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.'[21]\n\nDefinitely, then, the influence of the Popes restored to their ancient\nsupremacy would be exercised in the renewal and consolidation of social\norder resting on the Christian faith, somewhat after this manner.The\nanarchic dogma of the sovereignty of peoples, having failed to do\nanything beyond showing that the greatest evils resulting from obedience\ndo not equal the thousandth part of those which result from rebellion,\nwould be superseded by the practice of appeals to the authority of the\nHoly See.Do not suppose that the Revolution is at an end, or that the\ncolumn is replaced because it is raised up from the ground.A man must\nbe blind not to see that all the sovereignties in Europe are growing\nweak; on all sides confidence and affection are deserting them; sects\nand the spirit of individualism are multiplying themselves in an\nappalling manner.There are only two alternatives: you must either\npurify the will of men, or else you must enchain it; the monarch who\nwill not do the first, must enslave his subjects or perish; servitude or\nspiritual unity is the only choice open to nations.On the one hand is\nthe gross and unrestrained tyranny of what in modern phrase is styled\nImperialism, and on the other a wise and benevolent modification of\ntemporal sovereignty in the interests of all by an established and\naccepted spiritual power.No middle path lies before the people of\nEurope.The only question is whether\nor no it shall be modified by the wise, disinterested, and moderating\ncounsels of the Church, as given by her consecrated chief.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThere can be very little doubt that the effective way in which De\nMaistre propounded and vindicated this theory made a deep impression on\nthe mind of Comte.Very early in his career this eminent man had\ndeclared: 'De Maistre has for me the peculiar property of helping me to\nestimate the philosophic capacity of people, by the repute in which they\nhold him.'Among his other reasons at that time for thinking well of M.\nGuizot was that, notwithstanding his transcendent Protestantism, he\ncomplied with the test of appreciating De Maistre.[22] Comte's rapidly\nassimilative intelligence perceived that here at last there was a\ndefinite, consistent, and intelligible scheme for the reorganisation of\nEuropean society, with him the great end of philosophic endeavour.Its\nprinciple of the division of the spiritual and temporal powers, and of\nthe relation that ought to subsist between the two, was the base of\nComte's own scheme.In general form the plans of social reconstruction are identical; in\nsubstance, it need scarcely be said, the differences are fundamental.The temporal power, according to Comte's design, is to reside with\nindustrial chiefs, and the spiritual power to rest upon a doctrine\nscientifically established.De Maistre, on the other hand, believed that\nthe old authority of kings and Christian pontiffs was divine, and any\nattempt to supersede it in either case would have seemed to him as\ndesperate as it seemed impious.In his strange speculation on _Le\nPrincipe Generateur des Constitutions Politiques_, he contends that all\nlaws in the true sense of the word (which by the way happens to be\ndecidedly an arbitrary and exclusive sense) are of supernatural origin,\nand that the only persons whom we have any right to call legislators,\nare those half-divine men who appear mysteriously in the early history\nof nations, and counterparts to whom we never meet in later days.Elsewhere he maintains to the same effect, that royal families in the\ntrue sense of the word 'are growths of nature, and differ from others,\nas a tree differs from a shrub.'People suppose a family to be royal because it reigns; on the contrary,\nit reigns because it is royal, because it has more life, _plus d'esprit\nroyal_--surely as mysterious and occult a force as the _virtus\ndormitiva_ of opium.The common life of man is about thirty years; the\naverage duration of the reigns of European sovereigns, being Christian,\nis at the very lowest calculation twenty.How is it possible that 'lives\nshould be only thirty years, and reigns from twenty-two to twenty-five,\nif princes had not more common life than other men?'Mark again, the\ninfluence of religion in the duration of sovereignties.All the\nChristian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient\nand modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns.The reigns in England, which averaged more than twenty-three years\nbefore the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and\nthose of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure\nof seventeen.Denmark, however, for some unknown cause does not appear\nto have undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with\nrather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising.As a matter\nof fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and\nthere was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the\nuniverse in the fact that a Catholic prince should live longer than a\nProtestant; indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view\nbeing true.Many differences among the people who hold to the\ntheological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the\ndifferent degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the\nintervention of God, from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the\nground by a special and direct energy of the divine will, up to those\nat the opposite end of the scale, who think that direct participation\nended when the universe was once fairly launched.De Maistre was of\nthose who see the divine hand on every side and at all times.If, then,\nProtestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which God had\nprovided for the comfort and salvation of men, why should not God be\nlikely to visit princes, as offenders with the least excuse for their\nbackslidings, with the curse of shortness of days?In a trenchant passage De Maistre has expounded the Protestant\nconfession of faith, and shown what astounding gaps it leaves as an\ninterpretation of the dealings of God with man.'By virtue of a terrible\nanathema,' he supposes the Protestant to say, 'inexplicable no doubt,\nbut much less inexplicable than incontestable, the human race lost all\nits rights.Plunged in mortal darkness, it was ignorant of all, since it\nwas ignorant of God; and, being ignorant of him, it could not pray to\nhim, so that it was spiritually dead without being able to ask for life.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Arrived by rapid degradation at the last stage of debasement, it\noutraged nature by its manners, its laws, even by its religions.It\nconsecrated all vices, it wallowed in filth, and its depravation was\nsuch that the history of those times forms a dangerous picture, which it\nis not good for all men so much as to look upon.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.God, however, _having\ndissembled for forty centuries_, bethought him of his creation.At the\nappointed moment announced from all time, he did not despise a virgin's\nwomb; he clothed himself in our unhappy nature, and appeared on the\nearth; we saw him, we touched him, he spoke to us; he lived, he taught,\nhe suffered, he died for us.He arose from his tomb according to his\npromise; he appeared again among us, solemnly to assure to his Church a\nsuccour that would last as long as the world.'But, alas, this effort of almighty benevolence was a long way from\nsecuring all the success that had been foretold.For lack of knowledge,\nor of strength, or by distraction maybe, God missed his aim, and could\nnot keep his word.Less sage than a chemist who should undertake to shut\nup ether in canvas or paper, he only confided to men the truth that he\nhad brought upon the earth; it escaped, then, as one might have\nforeseen, by all human pores; soon, this holy religion revealed to man\nby the Man-God, became no more than an infamous idolatry, which would\nremain to this very moment if Christianity after sixteen centuries had\nnot been suddenly brought back to its original purity by a couple of\nsorry creatures.'[23]\n\nPerhaps it would be easier than he supposed to present his own system in\nan equally irrational aspect.If you measure the proceedings of\nomnipotence by the uses to which a wise and benevolent man would put\nsuch superhuman power, if we can imagine a man of this kind endowed with\nit, De Maistre's theory of the extent to which a supreme being\ninterferes in human things, is after all only a degree less ridiculous\nand illogical, less inadequate and abundantly assailable, than that\nProtestantism which he so heartily despised.Would it be difficult,\nafter borrowing the account, which we have just read, of the tremendous\nefforts made by a benign creator to shed moral and spiritual light upon\nthe world, to perplex the Catholic as bitterly as the Protestant, by\nconfronting him both with the comparatively scanty results of those\nefforts, and with the too visible tendencies of all the foremost\nagencies in modern civilisation to leave them out of account as forces\npractically spent?*       *       *       *       *\n\nDe Maistre has been surpassed by no thinker that we know of as a\ndefender of the old order.If anybody could rationalise the idea of\nsupernatural intervention in human affairs, the idea of a Papal\nsupremacy, the idea of a spiritual unity, De Maistre's acuteness and\nintellectual vigour, and, above all, his keen sense of the urgent social\nneed of such a thing being done, would assuredly have enabled him to do\nit.In 1817, when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted, the\nhopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now.The Revolution lay in a deep slumber that\nmany persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football there.Legitimacy\nand the spiritual system that was its ally in the face of the\nRevolution, though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone\ntogether, seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power.Fifty\nyears have elapsed since then, and each year has seen a progressive\ndecay in the principles which then were triumphant.It was not,\ntherefore, without reason that De Maistre warned people against\nbelieving '_que la colonne est replacee, parcequ'elle est relevee_.'The\nsolution which he so elaborately recommended to Europe has shown itself\ndesperate and impossible.Catholicism may long remain a vital creed to\nmillions of men, a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment,\nand a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals; but resting on\ndogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the\ndaily increasing mass of knowledge, assuming as the condition of its\nexistence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the\npreponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or\nindirectly in discrediting, upheld by an organisation which its history\nfor the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of\nmen as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth, the pretensions of\nCatholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent\nthat ever devout, high-minded, and benevolent persons deluded themselves\ninto maintaining or accepting.Over the modern invader it is as\npowerless as paganism was over the invaders of old.The barbarians of\nindustrialism, grasping chiefs and mutinous men, give no ear to priest\nor pontiff, who speak only dead words, who confront modern issues with\nblind eyes, and who stretch out a palsied hand to help.Christianity,\naccording to a well-known saying, has been tried and failed; the\nreligion of Christ remains to be tried.One would prefer to qualify the\nfirst clause, by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe\neven with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure\nwithin the limits of the modern time.Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its\nfounder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human\nsentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting\nmen together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which\nit is unnecessary to discuss here.'_They talk about the first centuries\nof Christianity_,' said De Maistre, '_I would not be sure that they are\nover yet_.'Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over,\nit is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so\ndifferent from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve\nanother name.Even if Christianity, itself renewed, could successfully encounter the\nachievement of renewing society, De Maistre's ideal of a spiritual power\ncontrolling the temporal power, and conciliating peoples with their\nrulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral, appears to have little\nchance of being realised.The separation of the two powers is sealed,\nwith a completeness that is increasingly visible.The principles on\nwhich the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly\ncarried on, demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern\ncivilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape,\nor at any future time, of a connection whether of virtual subordination\nor nominal equality, which has laid such enormous burdens on the\nconsciences and understandings of men.If the Church has the uppermost\nhand, except in primitive times, it destroys freedom; if the State is\nsupreme, it destroys spirituality.The free Church in the free State is\nan idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public\nopinion of Europe, and the sovereignty of the Pope, like that of all\nother spiritual potentates, can only be exercised over those who choose\nof their own accord to submit to it; a sovereignty of a kind which De\nMaistre thought not much above anarchy.To conclude, De Maistre's mind was of the highest type of those who fill\nthe air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology, and the abstractions\nof the metaphysical stage of thought.At every point you meet the\nperemptorily declared volition of a divine being, or the ontological\nproperty of a natural object.The French Revolution is explained by the\nwill", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Every truth is absolute, not relative; every explanation is universal,\nnot historic.These differences in method and point of view amply\nexplain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who\nlook upon all knowledge as relative, and insist that the only possible\nroad to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the\npositive generalisations of experience.There can be no more\nsatisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these\nancient methods, and the social results which they produced, than the\nwillingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how\nindispensable were the first, and how beneficial the second.Those can\nbest appreciate De Maistre and his school, what excellence lay in their\naspirations, what wisdom in their system, who know most clearly why\ntheir aspirations were hopeless, and what makes their system an\nanachronism.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[10] De Maistre forgot or underestimated the services of Leo the\nIsaurian whose repulse of the Caliph's forces at Constantinople (A.D.717) was perhaps as important for Europe as the more renowned victory of\nCharles Martel.But then Leo was an Iconoclast and heretic.Finlay's\n_Byzantine Empire_, pp.[11] _Du Pape_, bk.[12] _Du Pape_, bk.'The Greeks,' he\nsays, 'had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical\ncontroversies in the Eastern Church, though the circumstance of these\ncontroversies having been carried on in the Greek language has made the\nnatives of Western Europe attribute them to a philosophic, speculative,\nand polemic spirit, inherent in the Hellenic mind.A very slight\nexamination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the\nheresies which disturbed the Eastern Church had their origin in the more\nprofound religious ideas of the oriental nations, and that many of the\nopinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the\nmental nationality of the Syrians, Armenians, Egyptians, and Persians,\nand had no conception whatever with the Greek mind.'--_Byzantine Empire,\nfrom 716 to 1057_, p.263) remarks very truly, that 'the religious or\ntheological portion of Popery, as a section of the Christian Church, is\nreally Greek; and it is only the ecclesiastical, political, and\ntheoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the\nwork of the Latin Church.'[14] Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen in the _Saturday Review_, Sept.[15] _Du Pape_, bk.[18] '_Il n'y a point de souverainete qui pour le bonheur des hommes, et\npour le sien surtout, ne soit bornee de quelque maniere, mais dans\nl'interieur de ces bornes, placees comme il plait a Dieu, elle est\ntoujours et partout absolue et tenue pour infaillible.Et quand je parle\nde l'exercice legitime de la souverainete, je n'entends point ou je ne\ndis point l'exercice_ juste, _ce qui produirait une amphibologie\ndangereuse, a moins que par ce dernier mot on ne veuille dire que tout\nce qu'elle opine dans son cercle est_ juste ou tenu pour tel, _ce qui\nest la verite.C'est ainsi qu'un tribunal supreme, tant qu'il ne sort\npas de ses attributions, est toujours juste_; car c'est la meme chose\nDANS LA PRATIQUE, d'etre infaillible, ou de se tromper sans appel.'--Bk.[19] Thomassin, the eminent French theologian, flourished from the\nmiddle to the end of the seventeenth century.The aim of his writings\ngenerally was to reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or\ndoctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all.In this spirit he wrote on\nthe Pope and the Councils, and on the never-ending question of Grace.Among other things, he insisted that all languages could be traced to\nthe Hebrew.He wrote a defence of the edict in which Lewis XIV.revoked\nthe Edict of Nantes, contending that it was less harsh than some of the\ndecrees of Theodosius and Justinian, which the holiest fathers of the\nChurch had not scrupled to approve--an argument which would now be\nthought somewhat too dangerous for common use, as cutting both ways.Gibbon made use of his _Discipline de l'Eglise_ in the twentieth\nchapter, and elsewhere.[20] _Du Pape_, bk.[22] Littre, _Auguste Comte et la Phil.[23] _Du Pape_, Conclusion, p.*       *       *       *       *\n\nEND OF VOL.*       *       *       *       *\n\n_Printed by_ R.& R.

who, in view of\ndanger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far\nback it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.\"\"Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness.\"There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's\nlife: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese\n\nWhen the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,\nwhen they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the\ninfamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When\nthe forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to\nget the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched\nChinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference\nof the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the\n\"American system of religion\" were burning women charged with nursing\ndevils, these people \"incapable of being influenced by the exalted\ncharacter of our civilization,\" were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform\n\nNeither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese\nhave honestly practised the great principle known as civil service\nreform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has\nreached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ\n\nThe English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and\nChrist.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their\nshores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied\nthat time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port\nproves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God\n\nTreat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no\naccount excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are\ndishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS\n\n\n\n\n482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII\n\nIn the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the\napostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament\nof England an act entitled, \"An act for abolishing of diversity of\nopinion.\"And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was\nobliged to believe:\n\nFirst, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus\nChrist.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and\nthe blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,\n\nSixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the apple there.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what\nto believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the\npeople wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned\n\nAccording to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate\nfor six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which\nimpels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The\nDeity will damn Spencer and his \"Evolution,\" Darwin and his \"Origin\nof Species,\" Bastian and his \"Spontaneous Generation,\" Huxley and his\n\"Protoplasm,\" Tyndall and his \"Prayer Gauge,\" and will save those, and\nthose only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the\nsmallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to\nthat only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian\nConfession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute\n\nImagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The\nend that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are\northodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated\nchurch.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,\nside by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this\ndifference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois\n\nThe supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that\nan unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not\nbe allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have\nbeen murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other\nwitnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He\nwas liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to\ncontribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges\nwho decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any\ncourt.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption\nof the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored\nto chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot\n\nNow and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,\nand has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious\nget together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most\nprophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the\ntree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students\n\nThousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various\nChurches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate\nthe phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only\nobject, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may\nlearn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in\nthe dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus\ntrained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,\nhe is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly\nimpossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you\nthink the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it\nwrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,\nthat most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of\nfear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy\n\nA trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in\nthe Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it\nstill thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined\nto prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are\nshambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that\nthe Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with\nforce.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be\nbound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and\ndungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening\n\nFortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon\nthe Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and\nsciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,\nsuccumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,\nbut by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a\nrelic of the past.The cry of \"heresy\" has been growing fainter and\nfainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination\nhave ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of\ninfants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist \"Hoist with his own Petard.\"A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a\npiece of friendly advice.\"Although you may disbelieve the bible,\" said\nhe, \"you ought not to say so.\"Do\nyou believe the bible,\" said I. He replied, \"Most assuredly.\"To which\nI retorted, \"Your answer conveys no information to me.Of\ncourse a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be\nparticular about telling the truth himself.\"The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity\n\nWhat a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human\nheart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and\ngreat were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother\nbears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of\nthe natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;\nthat for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to\nheaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling\nin the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy\n\nWhoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be\nguilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name\ngiven by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of\nthe hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and\nwho, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of\nintellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet\nused in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian\nera, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment\ninflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This\neffort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the\nsalvation of the soul.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as\ncertainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They\ndo not say, \"we _think_ this is so,\" but \"we _know_ this is so.\"They do\nnot appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They\nkeep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing\nhas been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the\nauthority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly\nsin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation\nof superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable\ninfatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense\nimportance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will\nforever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts\nor denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the apple there.To practice\njustice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some\nincomprehensible creed.You must say, \"Once one is three, and three\ntimes one is one.\"The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to\nbelieve, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church\nas a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago\n\nOne hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have\nperished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in\nEngland, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves\nin the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their\nears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads\nbranded.The Despotism of Faith\n\nThe despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian\ncountries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time\nthe same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,\nin Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the\nworld, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the\nassumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware\n\nAnd what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says\na heretic, \"Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your\nchildren cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I\nwill hunt you to the very portals of the grave.\"Calvin's Petrified Heart\n\nLuther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor\nof his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified\nheart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly\ndeclared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the\nfounders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous\ntenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily\ninconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion\nas to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Logic is not confined to, nor has it\nbeen buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is\ntranslated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue\nof Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: \"O Jupiter!He then added: \"Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven\nagain, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you\nwere prostrate.\"The Tail of a Lion\n\nThere is no saying more degrading than this: \"It is better to be the\ntail of a lion than the head of a dog.\"It is a responsibility to think\nand act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they\njoin something and become the tail of some lion.They say, \"My party\ncan act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to\npay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself\nabout the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore.\"While the Preachers Talked the People Slept\n\nThe fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The\nfall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began\nto have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the\ncongregations slept.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories\nthemselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short\nof irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside\nworld was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while\nthe church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress\n\nChristianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human\nrace.Across the highway of progress it has always been building\nbreastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,\ndogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered\ntogether behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of\nmalice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into\na deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be\ncrowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of\nhearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you\nwill not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to\nsmilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not\nbeen found.The Real Eden is Beyond\n\nNations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy\nbecomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the\nyears sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are\nbehind us and the real Eden is beyond.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.It is said that a desire for\nknowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,\nit will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men\n\nLet us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,\nPresbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and\nwomen.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All\nother names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,\ngiven up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS\n\n\n\n\n507.On which of the six days was he\ncreated?Is it possible that God would make a successful\nrival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what\na snake with a \"spotted, dappled skin\" could do with an inexperienced\nwoman.He knew that if the serpent\ngot into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive\nthem out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he\nhimself would die upon the cross.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Must we, in order to be\ngood, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman\nwas a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to\ntake one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it\nnot possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these\nfables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God\ntake him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam\nand Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not\nacquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's\nreputation.Questions About the Ark\n\nHow was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what\nwas done with the filth?How were some\nportions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others\nkept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their\nrespective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,\nand they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things\nmust have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept\nup a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the\nslowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the\nplains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate\nrate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and\nso sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon\ntheir health.Of course, all the polar\nbears did not go.It could be confounded only by the\ndestruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at\nthat time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain\npresiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak\nthe words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch\nthe brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in\nthe machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the\nlanguage of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man\nto be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in\nthe thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take\nmyrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a\nholy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,\ncandlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,\nat the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put\nany of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,\nthe Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,\nthat whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off\nfrom his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot\nbelieve it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep\nare?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the\nearth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters\nhappen to run up hill?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of\nothers?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a\nlegal tender for labor performed?<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.Must we regard the auction block as an\naltar?Were the\nstealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and\neloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these\nthings; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who\nwill burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who\nburns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the\ninvestigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,\nlaugh at the honest folks in hell?<|begin_of_text|>John took the milk there.Will the agony of the damned increase\nor decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an\neternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has\nnot injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and\nentitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat\nthis atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG\n\nI do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the\nclouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,\nsoil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every\nheretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast\nout and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give\nhis individuality for what is called respectability.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really\nvaluable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or\nState solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically\nwe are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect\nminds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give\nup your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory\nof reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,\nthe ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:\n\"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of\nman.\"Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,\nbut after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of\nmen and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the\nhuman heart.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only\njustice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the\nsame as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been\nwet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne\nhave leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated\nto excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his\nexistence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the\nconditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what\nwould have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen\nis allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all\nreligions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our\nright to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his\nintellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this\nsense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own\nin which is found this passage: \"Blessed is the man and beloved of all\nthe gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;\nthey have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think\na man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long\ntime.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike\nourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than\nservile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt\nto ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any\ntime, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from\nhuman speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of\nthe Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too\nmuch thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the\nsword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition\nScience has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality\nenough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one\nwho had the grandeur to say his say.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.\"The Church says the earth is flat;

Ingersoll, by his Brother\n     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs\n     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our\n     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish\n     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would\ndo for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where\nmanhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were\nfalling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest\npoint; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,\nusing his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that\nkisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured\nwith the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour\nof all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash\nagainst the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a\nsunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther\nshore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every\nlife, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment\njeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep\nand dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but\nin the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic\nsouls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,\nwhile on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to\ntears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly\ngave alms.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully\ndischarged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand\ntimes I have heard him quote these words: \"For Justice all place a\ntemple, and all season, summer.\"He believed that happiness was the only\ngood, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only\nreligion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;\nand were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom\nto his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet\nflowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two\neternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,\nand the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless\nlips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of\ndeath hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the\nreturn of health, whispered with his latest breath, \"I am better now.\"Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that\nthese dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,\nto do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,\nstronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR\n\n     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were\n     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran\n     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the\ngreat struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the\nmusic of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We\nsee thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see\nthe pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those\nassemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the\ngreat army of freedom.Some are\nwalking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they\nadore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as\nthey lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing\nbabes that are asleep.Some are parting with\nmothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,\nand say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with\nbrave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her\narms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand\nwaves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,\nkeeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the\ngreat cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the\nfields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.We are by their side on all the gory\nfields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.We stand\nguard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with\nthem in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are\nwith them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,\nthe life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them\npierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in\nthe whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech\ncan never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden\nin the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man\nbowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings\ngoverned by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the\nstrokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through\ntangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the\nsacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the\nbrutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner\nof the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting\nshell.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.Instead of\nslaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches\nthe auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see\nhomes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want\nand crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They\nare at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the

see,\nthere's a difference in earning and being paid.Old Gripp is a mean\nskinflint.I should like to force one of his twenty-cent vests down his\nmiserly throat.\"Perhaps he pays me all he can\nafford.\"\"Perhaps he does, but I wouldn't bet high on it.He is making a fortune\nout of those who sew for him.There are some men that have no\nconscience.I hope some time you will be free from

on rainy, disagreeable days, Dan.\"\"It wouldn't be fun for you, mother, but you're not a boy.\"\"I am so sorry that you can't keep on with your education, Dan.You were\ngetting on so well at school.\"It was a thought that had often come to Dan, but he wouldn't own it, for\nhe did not wish to add to his mother's sadness.\"Oh, well, mother,\" he said, \"something may turn up for us, so we won't\nlook down in the mouth.\"\"I have got my bundled work ready, Dan, if you can carry it round to Mr.I hope he'll\npay you to-night, for our rent comes due to-morrow.\"Shall\nwe have enough to pay it?\"Even if old Gripp pays for the vests?\"Dan whistled--a whistle of dismay and anxiety, for he well knew that the\nlandlord was a hard man.Nathan Gripp's clothing store was located about a quarter of a mile from\nthe City Hall, on Chatham street.Not many customers from Fifth avenue\nowned him as their tailor, and he had no reputation up town.His prices\nwere undeniably low, though his clothes were dear enough in the end.His patrons were in general from the rural districts, or city residents\nof easy tastes and limited means.The interior of the store was ill-lighted, and looked like a dark\ncavern.But nearly half the stock was displayed at the door, or on the\nsidewalk, Mr.Gripp himself, or his leading salesman, standing in the\ndoor-way with keen, black eyes, trying to select from the moving crowds\npossible customers.He sold his clothes cheap, but they\ncost him little.He paid the lowest prices for work, and whenever told\nthat his wages would not keep body and soul together, he simply\nremarked:\n\n\"That's nothing to me, my good woman.If you don't like the pay, leave\nthe work for somebody else.\"Gripp could not afford to\nleave the work for somebody else.Half wages were better than none, and\nthey patiently kept on wearing out their strength that Nathan might wax\nrich, and live in good style up town.Gripp himself was standing in the door-way when Dan, with the bundle\nof vests under his arm, stopped in front of the store.Gripp was a\nlittle doubtful whether our hero wished to become a customer, but a\nglance at the bundle dispelled his uncertainty, and revealed the nature\nof his errand.\"I've brought home half a dozen vests,\" said Dan.asked Gripp, abruptly, for he never lavished any of the\nsuavity, which was a valuable part of his stock in trade, on his work\npeople.Here, Samuel, take the boy's bundle, and see\nif the work is well done.\"It was on the tip of Dan's tongue to resent the doubt which these words\nimplied, but he prudently remained silent.The clerk, a callow youth, with long tow- locks, made sleek with\nbear's grease, stopped picking his teeth, and motioned to Dan to come\nforward.\"Here, young feller,\" he said, \"hand over your bundle.\"The clerk surveyed the boy with a look of disapproval in his fishy\neyes.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.\"Didn't you call me a young feller?\"\"You've called me one twice, but I ain't at all particular.I'd just as\nlief call you an old feller,\" said Dan, affably.\"Look here, young chap, I don't like your manners,\" said the clerk, with\nan irritating consciousness that he was getting the worst of the verbal\nencounter.\"I'm sorry for that,\" answered Dan, \"because they're the best I've got.\"asked the salesman, with a feeble\nattempt at humor.\"That's the way I amuse my\nleisure hours.\"muttered the tallow-faced young man, \"I'll take a look at\nthem.\"He opened the bundle, and examined the vests with an evident desire to\nfind something wrong.He couldn't find any defect, but that didn't prevent his saying:\n\n\"They ain't over-well made.\"\"Well, they won't be over-well paid,\" retorted Dan.\"I don't know if we ought to pay for them at all.\"\"Honesty is the best policy, young feller,\" said Dan.\"Wait here a\nminute till I speak to Mr.He kept Dan before the counter, and approached the proprietor.Gripp, stroking his jet-black\nwhiskers.\"Pretty well, sir, but the boy is impudent.\"\"He don't seem to have any respect for me--or you,\" he added, shrewdly.He cared very little about his clerk, but he\nresented any want of respect to himself.He felt that the balance at his\nbankers was large enough to insure him a high degree of consideration\nfrom his work-people at least.\"And the boy wants his pay, I suppose.\"\"He hasn't asked for it, but he will.\"Tell him we only pay when a full dozen are finished and brought in.We'll credit him, or his mother, with these.\"\"That'll pay them off,\" thought the astute clothing merchant.Samuel received this order with inward satisfaction, and went back\nsmiling.\"Well, young feller,\" said he, \"it's all right.The vests ain't\nover-well done, but we'll keep 'em.\"It seems to me you've forgotten something,\" he said.We'll pay when the next half dozen are brought in.This was entirely out of the usual\ncourse, and he knew very well that the delay would be a great\ninconvenience.\"We've always been paid when we brought in work,\" he said.\"We've changed our rule,\" said the clerk, nonchalantly.\"We only pay\nwhen a full dozen are brought in.\"We need the money, and can't\nwait.\"\"Then I'll speak to him,\" said Dan, promptly.Gripp,\" said he, \"I've just brought in half a dozen vests, but your\nclerk here won't pay me for them.\"\"You will get your pay, young man, when you bring in another half\ndozen.\"\"Will you pay me to-night as a favor?\"pleaded Dan, humbling himself for\nhis mother's sake.\"I can't break over my rule,\" said Nathan Gripp.\"Besides, Samuel says\nthe work isn't very well done.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.ejaculated the angry Samuel, his tallowy\ncomplexion putting on a faint flush.\"Didn't I tell you he was\nimpudent?\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.Nathan Gripp's small black eyes snapped viciously.\"Boy,\" said he, \"leave my store directly.How dare you address me in\nsuch a way, you young tramp?\"\"I'm no more a tramp than yourself,\" retorted Dan, now thoroughly angry.\"Samuel, come here, and put out this boy!\"exclaimed Nathan, too\ndignified to attempt the task himself.Samuel advanced, nothing loth, his fishy eyes gleaming with pleasure.Samuel seized Dan by the shoulder, and attempted to obey orders, but our\nhero doubled him up with a blow from his fist, and the luckless clerk,\nfaint and gasping, staggered and nearly fell.Dan stepped out on the sidewalk, and raising his hat, said, with mock\npoliteness, \"Good-morning, gentlemen!\"and walked away, leaving Gripp\nand his assistant speechless with anger.[Illustration: \"You're a couple of swindlers!\"When Dan's excitement was over, he felt that he had won a barren\nvictory.He had certainly been badly treated, and was justified in\nyielding to his natural indignation; but for all that he had acted\nunwisely.Nathan Gripp had not refused payment, he had only postponed it, and as\nhe had the decided advantage, which money always has when pitted against\nlabor, it would have been well to have been conciliatory.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.Now Gripp\nwould undoubtedly annoy him with further delay, and refuse to give Mrs.\"I suppose I've acted like a fool,\" said Dan to himself, with\ncompunction.\"My spunk is always getting the better of me, and I am\nafraid poor mother will have to suffer.Well, there's no use crying for\nspilt milk; I must see what I can do to mend matters.\"While these thoughts were passing through Dan's mind he found himself\npassing the clothing establishment of Jackson & Co., who were special\nrivals of Mr.\"Perhaps I can get some work for mother here,\" thought Dan.He entered, and looking about him, attracted the attention of a clerk.\"Do you want something in our line to-day?\"\"Yes, I do,\" said Dan, \"if you're giving things away; but as I've got a\nnote of ten thousand dollars to meet to-morrow, I can't pay anything\nout.\"\"Your credit ought to be good,\" said the salesman, smiling, \"but we\ndon't trust.\"\"All right,\" said Dan; \"I may as well proceed to business.One of our hands is sick, and if your\nmother understands how to do the work, we may be able to give her some.\"The young man went to the rear of the store, and returned with the\nproprietor.asked the proprietor, a big man, with\nsandy whiskers.He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on\nNathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated.\"Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years.\"He rather enjoyed this\nallusion to his rival.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money.\"I don't admire him much myself,\" said the Englishman.\"How much now did\nhe pay for vest-making?\"There is so much competition that we\nhave to sell low.\"\"Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for\ntwenty,\" said Dan.Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan:\n\n\"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?\"\"You don't look like one,\" said the boy.\"Joseph,\" said he, \"have we any vests ready for making?\"We have some bundles of half a dozen each.\"\"Take this boy's name and address and give him one.My boy, we will pay\nyour mother twenty-five cents each, but we expect good work.\"\"You will be satisfied, sir,\" said Dan, confidently, and he left the\nstore in excellent spirits.\"It's turned out right, after all,\" thought he; \"but I am afraid we\nshall miss the money old Gripp owed mother.I don't know how we are\ngoing to pay the rent to-morrow.We shall be over two dollars short\nunless something turns up.\"Dan carried the bundle of work home, and told his mother what had\nhappened.She was pleased with the increase of pay, but that was in the\nfuture.It would be a week before she could collect any pay from Jackson\n& Co., and the landlord would not wait.\"I wish I could think of some way of raising money,\" said Dan, putting\nhis face between his hands and looking thoughtful.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.\"If you only had some\njewels, mother, that we could raise money on now, we would be all\nright.\"\"I have nothing but my wedding-ring,\" said Mrs.Don't part with that unless you are obliged\nto.\"\"I would rather not, Dan, but if there is no other way----\"\n\n\"There must be another way.Just don't think of\nit any more, mother.\"Then we shall have all the forenoon to forage round in.It's only two\ndollars and a half we want.I ought to be able to raise two dollars and\na half.\"\"That is a great deal of money to us now, Dan.\"\"I wonder whether Shorty wouldn't lend it to me?\"\"He is a little hump-backed dwarf that keeps a cigar stand down on\nBroadway, not far from Trinity Church.He has a good trade, and doesn't\nwaste his money.\"I hope he will be willing to grant your request, Dan.\"He's a good-natured fellow, Shorty is, and he'll do it,\nif he can.I'll see him the first thing to-morrow morning.\"Somewhat cheered by Dan's confident tone, Mrs.Mordaunt went to sleep as\nearly as usual, forgetting the trouble possibly in store.The next morning, before selling his papers, Dan went round to Shorty's\nstand.\"Good-morning, Dan,\" said the dwarf, in a singularly melodious voice.\"I am going to ask a favor of you,\" said Dan, abruptly.\"Our rent's due to-day, and we are two dollars and a half short.I can\nmake the fifty cents before noon.Can you lend me two dollars till I am\nable to pay it?\"To Dan's dismay Shorty shook his head.\"I wish I could, Dan, but there's something in the way.\"\"If you're afraid I won't pay you back, you needn't think of that.I\nnever went back on a fellow that lent me money yet.\"\"I am not afraid of trusting you, Dan, but I haven't got the money.\"\"I understand,\" said Dan, coldly, for he suspected this to be a\nsubterfuge.\"No, you don't understand,\" said Shorty, eagerly.\"You think what I say\nis a sham, but you wouldn't if you knew all.\"\"If I knew all,\" repeated Dan, surprised.I didn't mean to, but I don't want you\nto misunderstand me.The fact is, Dan,\" Shorty added, sheepishly, \"I've\ngot more than myself to provide for now.\"\"I was married yesterday, Dan,\" said the cigar dealer, almost\napologetically, \"and I've been buying furniture, and the fact is, I\nhaven't got a cent to spare.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.\"Of course you haven't,\" said Dan.Dan looked, and saw a tall woman, of twenty-five or thereabouts,\napproaching the cigar stand.She was very plain, with a large mouth and\na long, aquiline nose.\"That's my wife,\" said the cigar dealer, regarding his tall partner with\nevident pride.\"Julia, my dear, this is my friend, Dan Mordaunt.\"\"Glad to see any friend of my husband,\" said the lady, in a deep, hoarse\nvoice, which might have been mistaken for a man's.\"So I will, thank you,\" answered Dan, surveying the female grenadier\nwith a wondering glance.-- Varick street, Dan, and I shall be very glad to see\nyou any evening.\"said Dan to himself, \"that's the queerest match I ever\nheard of.She might take Shorty up in her arms and carry him off.I\ndon't think he'll beat her very often,\" and Dan smiled at the thought.The morning wore away, and at eleven o'clock Dan had earned forty cents.There didn't seem to be much prospect of\nraising the rent before twelve o'clock.CHAPTER V.\n\nEFFECTING A LOAN.As Dan stood on the sidewalk with his bundle of papers, and only forty\ncents toward the two dollars and a half required for the rent, he felt\nlike many a business man who has a note to meet and not enough money on\nhand to pay it.Indeed, he was worse off, for generally business men\nhave friends who can help them with a temporary loan, but Dan's friends\nwere quite as poor as himself.One, however, Dick Stanton, a mere boy,\nhad the reputation of being more saving than his companions.It was\nknown that he had an account in the Bowery Savings Bank, and among the\nstreet boys he was considered wealthy.\"Perhaps I can borrow two dollars of him,\" thought Dan, as Dick passed\nhim on his way to Canal street.\"I say, Dick,\" said Dan, \"stop a minute.Our rent is due, and I can raise it\nall but that.\"Dick shook his head, and was about to speak, when Dan said hurriedly,\nfor he felt that it was his last chance:\n\n\"You needn't be afraid of me, Dick; I'll pay you sure, and give you more\ninterest, too, than you get in the bank.\"\"I haven't got any money in the bank, Dan.\"\"You had last week,\" said Dan, suspiciously.\"So I had, but I haven't now.\"\"You don't want to lend--that's what's the matter.\"I'm not a bit afraid of lending to you, but I\nhave lent my money already.\"asked Dan, ungrammatically, falling into a mistake made by\nplenty of greater age and better experience than himself.\"Of course it\nisn't any of my business,\" he added, \"if you don't want to tell.\"She's got two\nchildren, and a hard time to get along.Perhaps I shall never see it\nagain, but I couldn't refuse her.\"\"Of course you couldn't,\" said Dan, heartily.\"You've done right, and\nyou won't be sorry for it.I wish I knew some way of making two dollars\nbefore twelve o'clock.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.\"Are you in urgent need of two dollars, my boy?\"Dan turned, and met the face of the stranger introduced in the first\nchapter.\"Have you been extravagant and run up bills, Dan?\"\"No, sir; the only bill we have is the rent, and that comes due this\nnoon.\"\"I thought you said you wanted to borrow _two_ dollars.\"\"I've got four dollars toward it, sir.\"\"Do you often fall behind when rent day comes, Dan?\"\"No, sir; this is the first time in two years.\"Has business been duller than usual during\nthe last month?\"There hasn't been as much news in the papers,\nand my sales have fallen off.\"Mother has a dollar and twenty cents due her, and she can't collect\nit.\"Gripp won't pay till she has made a full dozen.\"\"I've a great mind to buy the debt of you.\"\"I wish you would, sir,\" said Dan, eagerly.\"That would leave only sixty\ncents short, for I shall make ten cents more before twelve o'clock, it's\nlikely.\"To put you quite at ease, I mean to lend\nyou five dollars, and help you collect your mother's bill.\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.\"You are very kind, sir,\" said Dan, surprised and grateful; \"but I don't\nneed so much.\"\"You may get short again when I am not here to assist you.\"\"Are you not afraid I shall never pay you, sir?\"\"That thought won't keep me awake nights,\" said the gentleman, laughing.\"You sha'n't lose anything by me, sir; I promise you that,\" said Dan,\nearnestly.\"Then come into the hotel with me, and we will arrange the matter in a\nbusiness-like way.\"Dan followed his new friend into the Astor House, and up stairs into a\npleasant bedroom, which in its comfortable apartments reminded Dan of\nthe days before his father's failure.\"I wish I could live so again,\" he thought.\"I don't like a\ntenement-house.\"Grant--for this was his name--took writing materials from his\nvalise, and seated himself at a table.\"I am going to draw up a note for you to sign,\" he said.\"I probably\nunderstand better than you the necessary form.\"His pen ran rapidly over the paper, and in a minute or two he handed Dan\nthe following form of acknowledgment:\n\n\n     \"NEW YORK, Sept.\"For value received I promise to pay to Alexander Grant five\n     dollars on demand with interest.\"Grant, \"put your name at the bottom.\"\"I added 'with interest,' but only as a form; I shall require none.\"interest make it\namount to in a year?\"\"Five dollars and thirty cents,\" answered Dan, promptly.I see you have not forgotten what you learned in school.\"\"I have ciphered through cube root,\" said Dan, with some pride.\"I am\nnot sure whether I remember that now, but I could do any sum in square\nroot.\"\"It is a pity you could not have remained in school.\"\"I should like to; but it's no use crying for spilt milk.\"\"As long as you didn't spill it yourself,\" added Mr.\"No, sir; it was not my fault that I had to leave school.\"Grant folded up the note and carefully deposited it in his wallet.\"The next thing is to hand you the money,\" he said.\"Shall I give you a\nfive-dollar bill, or small bills?\"\"Small bills, sir, if it is just as convenient.\"Grant placed in Dan's hands two two-dollar bills and a one.Gripp for the money\ndue your mother.It is as well to have it in your own handwriting.I\nwon't tell you how to write it.\"On the whole,\" said he, \"I believe I will take you with me when I call\nupon Mr.Can you call here at three o'clock this afternoon?\"Gripp will be any more\npolite to me than he was to you.\"\"He will be surprised to see me in your company,\" said Dan, laughing.\"It is a good thing to surprise the enemy, Dan.said Dan to himself, as he emerged into the street.\"Who would have thought that a stranger would lend me so large a sum?Now, if I could only sell the four papers\nI have left before twelve o'clock.I don't want to get stuck on them.\"Fortune was not tired of favoring Dan.In ten minutes he had sold his\npapers, and turned his steps toward the humble home where his mother was\nawaiting, not without anxiety, the visit of an unamiable landlord.Mordaunt looked up anxiously as Dan entered the room.She had\nlittle expectation that he had been able in one morning to make up the\nlarge deficiency in the sum reserved for the rent, but there was a\npossibility, and she clung to that.Dan thought of postponing the\nrelation of his good news, but when he saw his mother's anxious face, he\nfelt that it would be cruel.So when she said, \"Well, Dan?\"\"I've got it, mother,\" he said.\"You see He hasn't forgotten us,\" said Dan, gleefully.\"No, my boy, it is a rebuke to my momentary want of faith.How could you\nraise so large a sum?Surely you did not earn it in one forenoon?\"I'm not smart enough to earn two dollars\nbefore twelve o'clock.\"\"Look at this, mother,\" and Dan displayed the bills.\"I didn't know we had a friend left, able or willing to lend us that\nsum.\"\"I borrowed them of Alexander Grant, of St.Louis, and gave my note for\nthem,\" answered Dan, in a tone of some importance.\"He's a new friend of mine, mother.I haven't known him over twenty-four\nhours.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.As the old friends have treated us so badly, I'm goin' in for new\nones.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.\"He's very kind to a stranger, Dan.Heaven will reward him, I am sure.\"I should enjoy helping\nthose who needed it.If I ever get rich--though it doesn't look much\nlike it now--I will do all the good I can.I wonder rich men don't do it\noftener.\"\"And from selfishness pretty often,\" added Dan, whose views of human\nnature were considerably less favorable than they had been in his more\nprosperous days.\"A good many men are like Tom Carver, as he is now and\nwill be when he is grown up.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the football there.\"Perhaps there are more good and generous men than we suppose, Dan,\"\nurged his mother, who liked to think well of her fellow-beings.Just you step into\nthe bedroom, mother.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.Mordaunt had no desire to meet Mr.Grab, but she was a little\nafraid of Dan's impetuous temper.\"You will treat him respectfully, won't you, Dan?\"she urged, as she\nturned to go into the adjoining room.\"I'll treat him with all the respect he deserves, mother,\" he answered.Mordaunt looked a little doubtful, for she understood Dan, but did\nnot say more, for Mr.\"Don't come out, whatever you hear, mother,\" said Dan, in a low voice.\"I'll come out all right, though I shall tantalize him a little at\nfirst.\"Dan called out, in a loud, clear tone.The door opened, and a thin, undersized man, with bushy red hair and the\nlook of a cross mastiff, entered the room.Before his entrance Dan had seated himself in the plain wooden\nrocking-chair with his feet on a cricket.He looked quite easy and\nunconcerned.\"You might call me _Mr._ Grab,\" returned the landlord, angrily.\"I've no objection, I'm sure, Mr.\"I am perfectly well, and I am not yellow at all", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "\"I wouldn't do that for a cent, Mr.I am glad you feel well,\nthough you ain't looking so.It's very friendly of you to come round to\nsee me and mother.\"\"She is engaged just now, and won't have the pleasure of seeing you.\"\"I've seen more of you than I want to already,\" said Grab.\"That isn't talking like a friend, Mr.Grab,\" said Dan, \"when I'm so\nglad to see you.\"Of course I have come on business, and you know very well what that\nbusiness is, you young monkey.\"It isn't about the\nrent, is it?\"\"Oh, dear, how could I have forgotten that it was rent-day,\" said Dan,\nwith well-feigned confusion.He concluded that he wasn't going to collect\nthe rent, and that always chafed him.\"It's your business to know when rent-day comes,\" he said, bringing down\nhis fist with such emphasis on the table that he hurt his knuckles, to\nDan's secret delight.\"Please don't break the table, Grab,\" said Dan.said Grab, surveying his red knuckles.\"We haven't got any blasting powder, and I don't think it would be a\nvery interesting experiment.It might blow you up, for you are nearest\nto it.\"\"Have done with this trifling, boy,\" said the landlord.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.\"I am afraid you got out of the wrong end of the bed this morning, Mr.\"Look here, boy,\" said the landlord, savagely, \"do you know what I am\ntempted to do?\"\"I am strongly tempted to chastise you for your impudence.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Dan looked critically at the small, thin form, and secretly decided that\nMr.Grab would find it difficult to carry out his threat.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the football there.\"I don't believe I shall sleep any\nto-night.\"Grab made a motion to pound on the table again, but he looked at his\nred knuckles and wisely forbore.\"I can't waste any more time,\" he said.\"You must pay your rent, or turn\nout.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.The rent must be paid to-day, or out you go.\"\"Really, he\nought not to tease the poor man so.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.He has such a bad temper, he might\nhurt Dan.\"As soon as he pays her, I will call\nround at your office and pay you.\"\"I won't let you stay here another night, and\nI mean to have security for my money, too.\"So saying, the landlord seized the bundle of vests which lay on the\ntable beside him.He sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing with anger.\"Then pay me my rent,\" said the landlord, recoiling a little.\"Put down that bundle before you say another word about rent.It isn't\nmy mother's or mine.\"What do you mean, boy, by your impudence?\"demanded the landlord, a\nlittle uneasily.\"I mean that if you take that bundle from the room, I shall put you in\ncharge of the nearest policeman on a charge of stealing.\"\"That is nonsense,\" said Grab; but he looked nervous, and laid down the\nbundle.\"Now, as I don't want any more of your\ncompany, I'll pay the rent, if you'll give me a receipt.\"There, that is settled, and now,\nMr.Grab, I have the honor of wishing you good-evening.I hope you won't\nhurt your knuckles again.\"Grab left the room, inwardly wishing that he could wring Dan's neck.asked his mother, reproachfully, as she\nre-entered the room.\"Didn't he turn out the poor Donovans on\na cold day last winter?Punctually at three o'clock Dan knocked at the door of Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.Grant's room\nin the Astor House.That gentleman looked at his watch as he admitted our hero.\"You are punctual to the minute,\" he said.\"I'll tell you why,\" answered Dan, smiling.\"I always keep it at\nTiffany's.I don't dare to carry it for fear it will get out of order.\"\"You ought to have a watch,\" said Mr.\"Then I could be sure to keep my business\nappointments.Now I have to depend on the City Hall clock.I'd rather\nlook at it than carry it round.\"He'll think you are going to buy some\nclothes.I don't think he'll be very happy to see me.\"I don't think you would like to patronize\nhis establishment.\"\"By the way, Dan, you have given me an order for money, and I have not\nhanded you the equivalent.\"By the way, Dan, that coat of yours\nis getting shabby.\"Boys in my business don't have to dress\nmuch.\"Please hand me my hat, and we will start.\"One or two of Dan's associates\nwhom they encountered on the way, were surprised to see him walking on\nterms of apparent friendly companionship with a well-to-do stranger, but\ndecided that Dan was probably acting as his guide.Gripp standing as usual in the door-way of his shop\nwatching for customers.He did not at first observe Dan, but his\nattention was drawn to Mr.\"Walk in, sir,\" he said, obsequiously.Styles fashionable, and as for prices--we defy competition.\"Alexander Grant paused, and looked critically about him.He understood\nvery well the sort of establishment he was about to enter, and would not\nhave thought of doing so but in Dan's interests.He stepped over the threshold, and Dan was about to follow, when the\neagle eye of Mr.\"Don't you come round here\nany more.\"Dan did not answer, for he knew Mr.Grant turned back, and said, quietly:\n\n\"To whom are you speaking, sir?\"\"I beg your pardon, sir--it's that boy.\"\"Then, sir, you will oblige me by stopping at once.That boy is in my\ncompany and under my protection.\"Nathan Gripp stared as if transfixed.He was here\nyesterday, and acted outrageously.He assaulted my clerk and insulted\nme.\"He is in my company, and if I enter the\nstore he will.\"\"Oh, of course, if he's with you he can come in.Samuel, show the\ngentleman what he wants.\"Dan smiled, and nothing but a sense of his own interest prevented Mr.asked the callow young man named Samuel,\nglaring at Dan in vivid remembrance of the blow which had doubled him\nup.\"Have you any coats and vests that will fit this young gentleman?\"repeated Samuel, mechanically, glancing at Dan in\nsilent hatred.\"That means me, Samuel,\" said Dan, mischievously.\"Samuel is an old\nfriend of mine, Mr.\"I think we can fit him,\" said Samuel, by no means relishing the task of\nwaiting upon his young opponent.\"Take off your coat, young feller.\"\"I'll be ---- if I do,\" muttered the young man.Dan took off his coat, and tried on the one submitted to his inspection.He afterward tried on the vest, and they proved to be a good fit.\"Yes, sir, they fit as well as if they had been made for me.\"\"What is the price of these articles, young man?\"\"He'll take eight,\" suggested Dan, in a low voice.Grant knew well enough the ways of Chatham street merchants to\nappreciate the suggestion.\"That is too high,\" he said, quietly.Samuel, who was trained to read customers, after a glance at Mr.Grant's\nface, prepared to reduce the price.\"We might say eleven,\" he said, meditatively.\"You don't want us to give 'em away?\"said Samuel, in the tone of one\nwhose reasonable demands had been objected to.\"There is no fear of that, I apprehend,\" returned Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football.\"I've no objection, I'm sure,\" remarked Dan, on his own account.\"I'd make a few remarks to you, young feller, if you were alone,\" he\nread in the eyes of the indignant salesman, and Dan enjoyed the\nrestraint which he knew Samuel was putting upon himself.\"You are still asking too much,\" said the customer.\"The work didn't cost you much, I presume.\"\"We pay the highest prices for work in this establishment, sir,\" said\nSamuel, hastily.\"They pay twenty cents apiece for\nmaking vests.\"\"We pay more than that to our best hands,\" said Samuel.\"You told me you never paid more,\" retorted Dan.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.\"Young man,\" said he, \"I will give you eight dollars for the clothes.\"As the regular price was eight dollars--when they couldn't get any\nmore--Samuel felt authorized to conclude the bargain without consulting\nMr.\"No,\" said Dan, \"I'll wear 'em.Samuel felt it derogatory to his dignity to obey the orders of our hero,\nbut there was no alternative.\"Now write me a receipt for the price,\" said Mr.\"I have an order upon you for the balance,\" he said.\"Your principal owes my young friend, or his mother, one dollar and\ntwenty cents for work.This you will receive as part of the price.\"\"We can't take the order, sir,\" he said.\"The boy's money is not yet\ndue.\"\"Yes, sir; but it is our rule not to pay till a whole dozen is\ndelivered.\"\"Then it is a rule which you must break,\" said Mr.Nathan Gripp did not like to lose the sale on the one hand, or abdicate\nhis position on the other.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.\"Tell your mother,\" he said to Dan, \"that when she has finished another\nhalf-dozen vests I will pay her the whole.\"He reflected that the stranger would be gone, and Dan would be in his\npower.\"Thank you,\" said Dan, \"but mother's agreed to work for Jackson.\"Then you'll have to wait for your pay,\" said Mr.\"Yes, sir, but under the circumstances we must ask all cash.\"\"Then I don't think we care to sell,\" said Gripp, allowing his anger to\novercome his interest.I think, Dan, we can find quite as good a bargain at\nJackson's.Gripp, do I understand that you decline to pay this\nbill?\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.\"I will pay when the other half-dozen vests are made,\" said Gripp,\nstubbornly.The bill is mine, and it is with me you\nhave to deal.Settle the bill now, or I shall\nimmediately put it in a lawyer's hands, who will know how to compel you\nto pay it.\"\"Take this gentleman's money, Samuel,\" said Gripp, in a tone of\nannoyance.Dan walked out of the store better\ndressed than he had been since the days of his prosperity.\"By continuing to care for your mother, my lad.You are lucky to have a\nmother living.Now, my lad, what do you\nthink of my success in collecting bills?\"\"You were too many for old Gripp, sir.\"He doesn't deserve to, for he grows rich by defrauding the poor who\nwork for him.\"Opposite the City Hall Park Dan and his friend separated.\"I shall not see you again, my boy,\" said Mr.Grant, \"for I take the\nevening train.\"That's a good man,\" said Dan, as he wended his way homeward.\"If there\nwere more such, it would be good for poor people like mother and me.If\nI ever get rich, I mean to help along those that need it.\"MIKE RAFFERTY'S TRICK.Dan carefully husbanded the money which Mr.Grant had lent him, and the\nresult was that for two months he was comparatively easy in his\ncircumstances.His mother earned five cents more daily, on account of\nthe higher price she received for work, and though this was a trifle, it\nwas by no means to be despised where the family income was so small as\nin the case of the Mordaunts.\"Mother,\" said he, \"I suppose I ought to be contented with earning\nenough to pay our expenses, but I should like to be saving something.\"But we ought to be thankful for what we\nare now receiving.\"\"But, mother, suppose I should fall sick?\"Don't mention such a thing, Dan,\" she said.\"Don't be frightened, mother,\" answered Dan, laughing.\"I'm as strong as\na horse, and can eat almost as much.Still, you know, we would feel\nsafer to have a little money in the savings-bank.\"\"There isn't much chance of that, Dan, unless we earn more than we do\nnow.\"Well, I suppose there is no use thinking of it.By\nthe way, mother, you've got enough money on hand to pay the rent\nto-morrow, haven't you?\"The door of the room was partly open, and the last part of the\nconversation was heard by Mike Rafferty, the son of the tenant who\noccupied the room just over the Mordaunts.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.He was a ne'er-do-well, who\nhad passed more than one term of imprisonment at Blackwell's Island.His\nmother was an honest, hard-working washerwoman, who toiled early and\nlate to support herself and her three children.Mike might have given\nher such assistance that she could have lived quite comfortably, for her\nown earnings were by no means inconsiderable.Her wash-tub paid her much\nmore than Mrs.Mordaunts needle could possibly win, and she averaged a\ndollar a day where her more refined neighbor made but twenty-five\ncents.But Mike, instead of helping, was an additional burden.He got\nhis meals regularly at home, but contributed scarcely a dollar a month\nto the common expenses.He was a selfish rowdy, who was likely to belong\npermanently to the shiftless and dangerous classes of society.Mike had from time to time made approaches to intimacy with Dan, who was\nnearly two years younger, but Dan despised him for his selfishly\nburdening his mother with his support, and didn't encourage him.Naturally, Mike hated Dan, and pronounced him \"stuck up\" and proud,\nthough our hero associated familiarly with more than one boy ranking no\nhigher in the social scale than Mike Rafferty.Only the day before, Mike, finding himself out of funds, encountering\nDan on the stairs, asked for the loan of a quarter.\"I have no money to spare,\" answered Dan.\"You've got money, Dan; I saw you take out some a minute ago.\"\"Yes, I've got the money, but I won't lend it.\"\"You're a mane skinflint,\" said Mike, provoked.\"Because you've got the money, and you won't lend it.\"\"I want to go to the Old Bowery to-night, if you must know.\"\"If you wanted it for your mother I might have lent it to you, though I\nneed all I can earn for my own mother.\"\"It's for my mother I want it, thin,\" said Mike.\"I guess I won't go to\nthe theater to-night.\"Your mother would never see the color of it.\"If you want money, why don't you earn it, as I do?\"If you go to work and sell papers or black boots, you\nwill be able to help your mother and pay your way to the theater\nyourself.\"\"Kape your advice to yourself,\" said Mike, sullenly.\"You'd rather have my money,\" said Dan, good-humoredly.\"I'd like to put a head on you,\" muttered Mike.\"Oh, you think you're mighty smart wid your jokes,\" said Mike.Dan smiled and walked off, leaving Mike more his enemy than ever.Mordaunt say that she had more than\nthe rent already saved up.He knew that it\nmust amount to several dollars, and this he felt would keep him in\ncigarettes and pay for evenings at the theater for several days.\"I wish I had it,\" he said to himself.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\"I wonder where the ould woman\nkapes it.\"The more Mike thought of it the more he coveted this money, and he set\nto work contriving means to get possession of it.About three o'clock in the afternoon he knocked at Mrs.It's bad news I bring you about Dan.\"she exclaimed, her heart\ngiving a great bound.\"He's been run over, ma'am, by a hoss, in front of the Astor House, and\nthey took him into the drug store at the corner.\"I guess he's broke his leg,\" said Mike.Mordaunt, trembling with apprehension, her faltering\nlimbs almost refusing to bear her weight, was on her way to the Astor\nHouse.As Mike had calculated, she did not stop to lock the door.The young scape-grace entered the deserted room, rummaged about till he\nfound the scanty hoard reserved for the landlord, and then went off\nwhistling.\"Now I'll have a bully time,\" he said to himself.\"Didn't I fool the\nould woman good?\"MIKE'S THEFT IS DISCOVERED.Dan was standing in front of the Astor House, talking to a boy\nacquaintance, when his mother tottered up to him in a state of great\nnervous agitation.It occurred to him that his mother must\nhave lost her mind.\"Yes; they told me you were run over, and had your leg broken.\"\"Then I wish I had him here,\" said Dan, indignantly; \"I'd let him know\nwhether my leg is broken or not.\"Haven't you been run over, then?\"\"Not that I know of, and I guess it couldn't be done without my knowing\nit.\"\"I don't know how I\ngot here, I was so agitated.\"\"When did Mike Rafferty tell you this cock-and-bull story, mother?\"He said you had been taken into a drug store,\nand wanted me to come right over.\"\"It's a mean trick he played on you, mother,\" said Dan, indignantly.\"I\ndon't see what made him do it.\"\"I don't mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe.He didn't know how much he was distressing me.\"You may forgive him if you want to; I\nsha'n't.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.I feel a good deal happier than I did when I\nwas hurrying over here.\"I have sold my papers, and sha'n't work any\nmore this afternoon.I hope I can come across\nhim soon.\"\"I left him at the door of our room.\"\"Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?\"\"There isn't much to take, Dan,\" said Mrs.\"We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.\"\"You don't think Mike would take it do you, Dan?\"\"I think he would if he knew where to find it.\"\"I wish I had brought it with me,\" said Mrs.Mordaunt, in a tone of\nanxiety.\"Don't fret, mother; I guess it's all right.\"\"Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan.\"In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table.\"\"Then hereafter you'd better lock them.Well, I'll be off, and will meet\nyou at the room.\"Dan was not long in reaching his humble home.The more he thought of it,\nthe more he distrusted Mike, and feared that he might have had a\nsinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother.To\nlose the rent money would be a serious matter.Grab hated him, he\nknew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time\nremaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum.Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once\nto the little work-table.He pulled the drawer open without ceremony,\nand in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found\nthe pocket-book.\"It's all right, after all,\" he said.\"Mike isn't so bad as I thought\nhim.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell.There was a\ntwenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all.\"He's stolen the money, after all,\" he said, his heart sinking.\"That is all that is left,\" answered Dan, holding up the scrip.\"Mike could not be wicked enough to take it.\"You don't know him as I do, mother.He's a mean\nthief, and he sent you off to have a clear field.\"I couldn't think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you\nwere hurt.\"Grab will be angry when he finds we can't pay\nhim.\"\"I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can.Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs.She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been\nwashing.asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question.\"No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.\"\"Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs.He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could\nget a job, shure.I'm sorry to tell you that Mike has played a\nbad trick on my mother.\"\"Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!\"Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the\nwash-tub all day long.\"\"He's a bad son to you, Mrs.And what kind of trick has\nhe played on your good mother?\"\"He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg.Of course she\nwent out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he\ntook the money from her pocket-book.\"Some mothers would have questioned this statement, but Mrs.Rafferty\nknew to her cost that Mike was capable of stealing, having been\nimplicated in thefts on several occasions.I don't know what to do wid him, shure.\"\"It was the money we were to pay our rent with to-morrow,\" continued\nDan.\"I wish I could make it up to you, Dan, dear.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.Rafferty, but you ought not to make it\nup.Do you think he has really gone to\nBrooklyn.\"\"He might have done it as a blind, just to put me on the wrong scent.\"Rafferty, I can't stop any longer.He went down stairs and told his mother what he had discovered or failed\nto discover.\"Don't wait supper for me, mother,\" he said.I am not\ngoing to submit to the loss without trying to get the money back, you\nmay be sure of that.\"So Dan went down stairs, considerably perplexed in mind.Mike was sure\nto keep out of the way for a time at least, anticipating that Dan would\nbe upon his track.While our hero was searching for him, he would have\nplenty of opportunities of spending the money of which he had obtained\nunlawful possession.To punish him without regaining the contents of the\nlost pocket-book would be an empty triumph.In the street below Dan\nespied Terence Quinn, an acquaintance of Mike.\"I'll tell you where he'll be this evening.\"\"He's going to the Old Bowery, and I'm goin' wid him.\"\"He didn't tell me,\" said Terence.I'm sure of it now,\" said Dan to himself.\"I\nwish I knew where to find him.\"CHAPTER X.\n\nDAN AS A DETECTIVE.Dan quickly decided that if Mike had been going to Brooklyn, he would\nnot have announced it under the circumstances.\"He meant to send me there on a wild-goose chase,\" he reflected.\"I am\nnot quite so green as he takes me to be.\"Dan could not decide as easily where Mike had gone.Hood says in his\npoem of \"The Lost Heir,\"\n\n\n     \"A boy as is lost in London streets is like a needle in a bundle\n       of hay.\"A hunt for a boy in the streets of New York is about equally hopeless.\"I'll just stroll round a little,\" he said to himself.Dan bent his steps toward the Courtlandt-street Ferry.\"Perhaps Mike has gone to Jersey City,\" he said to himself.Six cents would defray Dan's expenses\nboth ways, and he was willing to incur this expense.He meant to look\nabout him, as something might turn up by which he could turn an honest\npenny.Near him in the cabin of the ferry-boat sat a gentleman of middle age,\nwho seemed overloaded with baggage.He had two heavy carpet-bags, a\nsatchel, and a bundle, at which he looked from time to time with a\nnervous and uncomfortable glance.When the boat touched shore he tried\nto gather his various pieces of luggage, but with indifferent success.Noticing his look of perplexity, Dan approached him, and said,\nrespectfully:\n\n\"Can't I assist you, sir?\"\"I wish you would, my boy,\" said the gentleman, relieved.I'll take one of the carpet-bags and the satchel, if\nyou like.\"\"Do you know the wharf of the Cunard steamers?\"\"Not more than five or six minutes' walk,\" answered Dan.\"Can you help me as far as that with my luggage?\"\"I will make it worth your while, and you will be doing me a great favor\nbesides.I was brought down to the ferry, but the rascally hackman\ndemanded five dollars more to carry me across and land me at the Cunard\npier.He thought I would have to submit to this imposition, but I was so\nindignant that I tried to handle all my luggage myself.I don't know how\nI should have managed without you.\"\"I won't charge you so much, sir,\" said Dan, smiling.\"It isn't for the money I cared so much as for the imposition.I would\nrather pay you ten dollars than the hackman five.\"\"Be careful, sir,\" said Dan, smiling, \"or I may take advantage of your\nliberal offer.\"\"You don't look like a boy that would take advantage of a traveler.\"I have been robbed of six\ndollars to-day, and I might try to make it up that way.\"\"Was it all the money your mother had?\"\"How did you happen to be coming across the ferry?\"By this time they were in sight of the Cunard wharf.\"Were you ever on a Cunard steamer?\"\"Help me on board with my luggage, and I will show you about.\"\"I thought the steamers generally left in the morning,\" said Dan.\"So they do; but to-day the tide did not serve till later.\"Stevens down below with his luggage, and assisted him in\nstoring them in his stateroom.He surveyed with interest the cabin, the\ndeck, the dining-saloon, and the various arrangements.\"Well,\" said the gentleman, smiling, \"how do you like it?\"\"Do you think you would like to be going with me?\"\"Of course, it won't do to desert her; otherwise I might be tempted to\nmake you an offer.I am sure you would be very useful to me.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.\"I should like it very much, if mother did not need me.\"Stevens, and remained till visitors were\nwarned that it was time to go ashore.Stevens drew a five-dollar bill from his vest pocket and handed it\nto Dan.\"I haven't any change, sir,\" said Dan.\"None is required,\" said the gentleman, smiling.\"Do you really mean to give me five dollars, sir?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.\"That is what the hackman wanted to charge me.\"\"It was too much for him; it is not too much for you, if I am willing to\ngive it to you.\"\"You are very kind, sir,\" said Dan, almost doubting the reality of his\ngood fortune.\"It will prove that I spoke truly when I said I didn't care for the\namount of money, only for the imposition.I am really very glad to give\nit to you.Dan shook it heartily, and, wishing him a pleasant\nvoyage, descended the gangplank.\"That is almost as much as Mike robbed me of,\" he said to himself.\"How\nlucky I came over to Jersey City!Now, if I could only get back part of\nthe money Mike robbed me of, I should be the better off for his mean\ntrick.\"He had been so fortunate\nthat he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon as he liked.He walked on for ten minutes, Mike being temporarily out of his mind,\nwhen his attention was suddenly drawn to him.Just in front of him he\nsaw Mike himself swaggering along, with a ten-cent cigar in his mouth,\nand both hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets.He was strolling\nalong in fancied security, not dreaming of the near presence of the boy\nwhom he had so meanly robbed.Dan's eyes sparkled when he recognized his enemy, and hastening his\npace, he put his hand on Mike's shoulder.Mike turned quickly, and his countenance changed when he saw Dan.\"Anyway, he\ncan't prove anything.\"What brings _you_ over here, Mike?\"\"I'm looking for a job,\" said Mike.\"You look like it,\" retorted Dan, \"with both hands in your pockets and\na cigar in your mouth!\"I don't know,\" answered Mike, with unblushing falsehood.\"A man gave it\nto me for holdin' his hoss.\"Mike was never at a loss for a plausible lie.\"Did they let you over the ferry free, then?\"\"Then how are you going to take Terence Quinn to the theater to-night?\"Even Mike's brazen effrontery was hardly prepared to meet this\nunexpected question.\"Terence told me you had invited him.\"\"Look here, Mike Rafferty,\" said Dan, out of patience; \"that won't go\ndown!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.I know where you got the money you were\ngoing to treat him with.\"\"It's the truth, and if you don't hand over what's left without making\nany more trouble, I'll have you arrested.\"We're in Jersey----\"\n\n\"I shall have you arrested as soon as you get home.\"\"I didn't take the money,\" said Mike, sullenly.\"You did, and you know it,\" said Dan, firmly.\"Give me what you have\nleft, and I'll make no trouble about it.If you don't, you're booked for\nanother term at the island.\"Mike tried to save his ill-gotten gains, but Dan was persistent, and\nfinally extracted from him four dollars and a half.The rest Mike\npretended he had spent.He was sly enough, however, to have saved enough\nto take him to the Old Bowery.On the whole, Dan was satisfied, considering the five dollars he had\nreceived on the Cunard steamer, but he could not forbear giving Mike a\nfarewell shot.\"How did it happen, Mike, that you took the Jersey Ferry to Brooklyn?\"\"That is my first appearance as a detective,\" thought Dan.It was only five o'clock when Dan, returning from Jersey City, found\nhimself again in front of the Astor House.I've\nmade enough to satisfy me for one day.\"Dan stood at the corner of Vesey street, glancing at the hurrying\ncrowds.He rather enjoyed his temporary freedom from business cares.He had made a good day's work, the morrow's rent was provided for, and\nhe felt like a gentleman of leisure.All at once his attention was drawn to a low sob.It proceeded from a\nlittle flower-girl of ten years, who usually stood near the hotel.asked Dan, calling her by her name, for the\nlittle flower-girl was one of his acquaintances.\"Haven't you sold as\nmany bouquets as usual?\"\"Yes,\" said Fanny, pausing in her sobs, \"I've sold more.\"\"No, but a young man passed a bad half-dollar on me.\"He did not need to ring it, for it was dull in\nappearance and unmistakably bad.A young man came up and bought a five-cent bouquet, and gave\nme this to change.\"\"Didn't you see that it was bad?\"\"So you gave him forty-five cents in good money, Fanny?\"\"Yes,\" said the little girl, again beginning to sob.\"Then you have less money than when you began?\"\"Do you think the fellow knew the piece was bad?\"\"No, I saw him turn down Fulton street.\"\"Give me the bad piece, and I'll go after him.Dan seized the money, and proceeded toward Fulton Ferry at a half run.\"I hope he won't have taken the boat,\" he said to himself.Dan nearly overthrew an apple woman's stand not far from the ferry, but\ndid not stop to apologize.He ran into a fat gentleman who looked\ndaggers at him, but kept on.Breathless he paid his ferriage, and just succeeded in catching a boat\nas it was leaving the New York pier.Thus far he had not seen the young man of whom he was in search.I'll go forward,\" said Dan to himself.He walked through the ladies' cabin, and stepped out on the forward\ndeck.The boat was crowded, for it was at the time when men who live in\nBrooklyn, but are employed in New York, are returning to their homes.Dan looked about him for a time without success, but all at once his\neyes lighted up.Just across the deck, near the door of the gentlemen's\ncabin, stood a young man with red hair, holding a small bouquet in his\nhand.His face was freckled, his eyes small, and he looked capable of\nmeanness.Of course appearances are often deceptive, but not unfrequently a man's\ncharacter can be read upon his face.\"That's the fellow that cheated poor Fanny, I'll bet a hat,\" Dan decided\nwithin himself.He immediately crossed to the other side of the deck.The red-headed young man was talking to another young man of about the\nsame age.\"Where did you get that bouquet, Sanderson?\"\"Bought it of a little girl in front of the Astor House,\" answered\nSanderson.\"I suppose it is meant for some young lady,\" suggested the other.\"Maybe it is,\" answered Sanderson, with a grin.Dan thought it was about time to come to business.He touched the red-haired young man on the arm.\"You bought that bouquet of a girl near the Astor House,\" said Dan.asked Sanderson, uneasily, for he had a suspicion of\nwhat was coming.\"You gave her a bogus half-dollar in payment,\" continued Dan.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.\"I am sorry I cannot accommodate you,\" said Dan, \"but I want you to give\nme a good piece for this first.\"\"I never saw that half-dollar before,\" said Sanderson.\"Perhaps you can prove that before the court,\" said Dan.\"I mean that you have passed counterfeit money, and unless you give me a\ngood piece for it I will give you in charge as soon as we reach the\npier,\" said Dan, firmly.Sanderson looked about him, and saw that the boy's charge was believed.\"Fanny is a poor girl,\" he said.", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>John took the milk there.\"I found her crying over her loss, for\nit was more than all the money she had taken to-day.\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Dan, stoutly.\"This is a put-up job between you two,\" said Sanderson.\"Gentlemen,\" said Dan, turning and appealing to the passengers near him,\n\"this young man has passed a bad fifty-cent piece on a poor flower-girl.exclaimed half a dozen, and several cried \"shame!\"with\nlooks of scorn and disgust directed toward the young man with red hair.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.\"I don't believe a word of it,\" he ejaculated, in a rage.\"But I'll give you the money to get rid of you,\" and he threw a\nhalf-dollar at Dan with a look very far from amiable.\"Thank you, sir; here's your money,\" said Dan.Though Sanderson had disclaimed all knowledge of the bogus half-dollar,\nhe took it and put it carefully in his pocket.\"Keep it to pay your washerwoman with,\" said a jeering voice.It was a young fellow in the garb of a workman who spoke.The boat touched the pier, and Sanderson was only too glad to hurry away\nfrom the unfriendly crowd.cried a keen-looking businessman, addressing Dan.\"How did you discover that this fellow was the one that passed the\ncoin.\"He placed in Dan's hands a card bearing the firm's name\n\n\n     BARTON & ROGERS,\n     Commission Merchants,\n               No.Dan was so pleased at having recovered Fanny's money that he gave\nlittle thought to this last incident, though it was destined to exert an\nimportant influence on his fortunes.He took the same boat back to New\nYork, and hurried to the Astor House.Little Fanny, the flower-girl, with a sad look upon her face, was still\nstanding in her wonted place.\"I've got your money back, Fanny,\" said Dan.\"Yes; I made the fellow give it up.\"There was a listener to what passed between the two children.A tall\nlady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively.She was evidently revolving some plan in her head.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.As Dan was about\nturning away, she placed her hand on his arm.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.\"Young man,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you.\"\"All right, ma'am,\" said Dan, surprised.Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to\nsend him on an errand, and his surprise vanished.She was tall, slender,\nand grave in appearance.\"Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?\"\"There is only one of me,\" answered Dan, humorously.\"If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.\"\"Yes,\" answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be\nonly curiosity on the part of the lady.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.She noticed at once the change\nin his manner.\"I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity,\" she said, quickly.\"All right, ma'am,\" he said; \"I am ready to answer.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.\"Are you at leisure for an hour or two?\"\"I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper,\" he\nsaid, hesitating.\"Can't you send her a message not to expect you?Does this little girl\nknow where you live?\"\"Little girl,\" she said, \"go at once and tell this boy's mother that he\nwill not be home till nine o'clock.The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents\nin her hand.As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of\nhim.What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to\nexplain his absence to his mother?\"Now,\" said the lady, \"if you will hail the next stage we will go up\ntown.\"Soon they were rattling over the pavements\nthrough thronged Broadway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.It was two years since Dan had been in a\nBroadway stage.He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but\nwhen it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage.Nearly\nopposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his\nside.Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Of\ncourse he did not betray any mark of recognition.\"I like riding in a Broadway stage,\" he heard the young lady say.\"There\nis more to see as you go along.\"Not always,\" said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it.\"The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage,\" said the\nyoung lady.\"It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.\"\"How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?\"\"I give it up,\" said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.\"Yes,\" answered Dan, \"I used to know him.\"\"I don't,\" said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first\ntime that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in\ncompany.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.\"What can they have to do with each other?\"\"She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed.\"At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a\npolite bow.\"Thank you,\" said the young lady, with a pleasant smile.\"You needn't have troubled yourself,\" said Tom Carver, irritated.\"This\nyoung lady is under _my_ charge.\"\"It is no trouble, I assure you,\" answered Dan.\"He is very polite,\" said the young lady, in a low voice, \"and very\ngood-looking, too,\" she added, with a second look at Dan.\"He is only a common newsboy,\" said Tom, not relishing Julia Grey's\ntribute to a boy he disliked.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.\"I can't help what he is,\" said the young lady, independently; \"he looks\nlike a gentleman.\"Dan could not help catching the drift of their conversation, and his\nface flushed with pleasure, for Julia was a very pretty girl, but not\nbeing addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise.\"He lives at the Five Points somewhere,\" muttered Tom.The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only\nsmiled in reply.The stage kept on till it reached Madison square.\"Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?\"He got out first, and helped his companion out.\"Follow me into the hotel,\" she said.asked the lady, as they ascended the stairs.\"I needn't ask if you have a good mother?\"\"One of the best,\" said Dan, promptly.\"You look like a well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady.Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the\nsofa beside her.\"You have already told me that you have no sister,\" she began.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.\"Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?\"\"I have a little girl under my charge--my niece--from whom, for reasons\nunnecessary to state, I am obliged to part for a time.Do you think your\nmother would be willing to take charge of her?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Of course I would make it\nworth her while.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.Thus it may\nbe stated that the number of bouches a fe\u00f9, which may comparatively\nbe brought into action, by equal means, on the scale of a troop of\nhorse artillery, would be at least six to one; and that they may\neither be spread over a great extent of line, or concentrated into a\nvery small focus, according to the necessity of the service; indeed\nthe skirmishing exercise of the Rocket Cavalry, divided and spread\ninto separate sections, and returning by sound of bugle, forms a very\ninteresting part of the system, and can be well imagined from the\nforegoing description and the annexed Plate.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.[Illustration: _Plate 3_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.1, represents a Rocket Car in line of march.There are\ntwo descriptions of these cars, of similar construction--one for 32\nor 24-pounder ammunition, the other for 18 or 12-pounder; and which\nare, therefore, called heavy or light cars: the heavy car will carry\n40 rounds of 24-pounder Rockets, armed with cohorn shells, and the\nlight one will convey 60 rounds of 12-pounder, or 50 of 18-pounder\nammunition, which is packed in boxes on the limber, the sticks being\ncarried in half lengths in the boxes on the after part of the carriage,\nwhere the men also ride on seats fixed for the purpose, and answering\nalso for small store boxes; they are each supposed to be drawn by four\nhorses.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.These cars not only convey the ammunition, but are contrived also\nto discharge each two Rockets in a volley from a double iron plate\ntrough, which is of the same length as the boxes for the sticks, and\ntravels between them; but which, being moveable, may, when the car is\nunlimbered, be shifted into its fighting position at any angle from the\nground ranges, or point blank up to 45\u00b0, without being detached front\nthe carriage.2 represents these Rocket Cars in action: the one on the left\nhand has its trough in the position for ground firing, the trough\nbeing merely lifted off the bed of the axle tree on which it travels,\nand laid on the ground, turning by two iron stays on a centre in the\naxle tree; the right hand car is elevated to a high angle, the trough\nbeing raised and supported by the iron stays behind, and in front by\nthe perch of the carriage, connected to it by a joint, the whole kept\nsteady by bolting the stays, and by tightening a chain from the perch\nto the axle tree.The limbers are always supposed to be in the rear.The Rockets are fired with a portfire and long stick; and two men will\nfight the light car, four men the heavy one.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.The exercise is very simple; the men being told off, Nos.1, 2, 3,\nand 4, to the heavy carriage.On the words, \u201c_Prepare for action, and\nunlimber_,\u201d the same process takes place as in the 6-pounder exercise.On the words, \u201c_Prepare for ground firing_,\u201d Nos.2 and 3 take hold\nof the hand irons, provided on purpose, and, with the aid of No.4,\nraise the trough from its travelling position, and lower it down to\nthe ground under the carriage; or on the words \u201c_Prepare to elevate_,\u201d\nraise it to the higher angles, No.4 bolting the stays, and fixing the\nchain.1 having in the mean time prepared and lighted his portfire,\nand given the direction of firing to the trough, Nos.2, 3, and 4,\nthen run to the limber to fix the ammunition, which No.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the milk.2 brings up,\ntwo rounds at a time, or one, as ordered, and helping No.1 to place\nthem in the trough as far back as the stick will admit: this operation\nis facilitated by No.1 stepping upon the lower end of either of the\nstick boxes, on which a cleat is fastened for this purpose; No.1 then\ndischarges the two Rockets separately, firing that to leeward first,\nwhile No.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.2 returns for more ammunition: this being the hardest duly,\nthe men will, of course, relieve No.In fighting the\nlight frame, two men are sufficient to elevate or depress it, but they\nwill want aid to fix and bring up the ammunition for quick firing.[Illustration: _Plate 4_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.2]\n\n\n\n\nROCKET INFANTRY IN LINE OF MARCH, AND IN ACTION.1, represents a sub-division of Rocket infantry in line\nof march--Fig.The system here shewn is the use\nof the Rockets by infantry--one man in ten, or any greater proportion,\ncarrying a frame, of very simple construction, from which the Rockets\nmay be discharged either for ground ranges, or at high angles, and\nthe rest carrying each three rounds of ammunition, which, for this\nservice, is proposed to be either the 12-pounder Shell Rockets, or the\n12-pounder Rocket case shot, each round equal to the 6-pounder case,\nand ranging 2,500 yards.So that 100 men will bring into action, in\nany situation where musketry can be used, nearly 300 rounds of this\ndescription of artillery, with ranges at 45\u00b0, double those of light\nfield ordnance.The exercise and words of command are as follow:\n\nNo.1 carries the frame, which is of very simple construction, standing\non legs like a theodolite, when spread, and which closes similarly\nfor carrying.This frame requires no spunging, the Rocket being fired\nmerely from an open cradle, from which it may be either discharged by\na lock or by a portfire, in which case.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.1 also carries the pistol,\nportfire-lighter, and tube box.2 carries a small pouch, with the\nrequisite small stores, such as spare tubes, portfires, &c.; and a long\nportfire stick.3, 4, and 5, &c. to 10, carry each, conveniently, on his back, a\npouch, containing three Rockets; and three sticks, secured together by\nstraps and buckles.With this distribution, they advance in double files.On the word\n\u201c_Halt_,\u201d \u201c_Prepare for action_,\u201d being given, No.1 spreads his frame,\nand with the assistance of No.2, fixes it firmly into the ground,\npreparing it at the desired elevation.2 then hands the portfire\nstick to No.1, who prepares and lights it, while No.2 steps back to\nreceive the Rocket; which has been prepared by Nos.3, 4, &c. who have\nfallen back about fifteen paces, on the word being given to \u201c_Prepare\nfor action_.\u201d These men can always supply the ammunition quicker than\nit can be fired, and one or other must therefore advance towards the\nframe to meet No.2 having thus received\nthe Rocket, places it on the cradle, at the same instant that No.2 then points the frame, which has an\nuniversal traverse after the legs are fixed; he then gives the word\n\u201c_Ready_,\u201d \u201c_Fire_,\u201d to No.1, who takes up his portfire and discharges\nthe Rocket.1 now sticks his portfire stick into the ground, and\nprepares another tube; while No.2, as before, puts the Rocket into the\nframe, points, and gives the word \u201c_Ready_,\u201d \u201c_Fire_,\u201d again.By this\nprocess, from three to four Rockets a minute may, without difficulty,\nbe fired from one frame, until the words \u201c_Cease firing_,\u201d \u201c_Prepare\nto advance_,\u201d or \u201c_retreat_,\u201d are given; when the frame is in a moment\ntaken from the ground, and the whole party may either retire or advance\nimmediately in press time, if required.To insure which, and at the\nsame time to prevent any injury to the ammunition, Nos.3, 4, &c. must\nnot be allowed to take off their pouches, as they will be able to\nassist one another in preparing the ammunition, by only laying down\ntheir sticks; in taking up which again no time is lost.If the frame is fired with a lock, the same process is used, except\nthat No.2 fires on receiving the word from\nNo.For ground firing, the upper part of this frame, consisting of the\nchamber and elevating stem, takes off from the legs, and the bottom of\nthe stem being pointed like a picquet post, forms a very firm bouche a\nfe\u00f9 when stuck into the ground; the chamber at point blank being at a\nvery good height for this practice, and capable of traversing in any\ndirection.The exercise, in this case, is, of course, in other respects\nsimilar to that at high angles.[Illustration: _Plate 5_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.2]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT.1, represents the mode of carrying the bombarding frame\nand ammunition by men.The apparatus required is merely a light\nladder, 12 feet in length, having two iron chambers, which are fixed\non in preparing for action at the upper end of the ladder; from which\nchambers the Rockets are discharged, by means of a musket lock; the\nladder being reared to any elevation, by two legs or pry-poles, as in\nFig.\u00a02.Every thing required for this service may be carried by men;\nor a Flanders-pattern ammunition waggon, with four horses, will convey\n60 rounds of 32-pounder Carcasses, in ten boxes, eight of the boxes\nlying cross-ways on the floor of the waggon, and two length-ways, at\ntop.On these the frame, complete for firing two Rockets at a flight,\nwith spunges, &c. is laid; and the sticks on each side, to complete\nthe stowage of all that is necessary, the whole being covered by the\ntilt.Four men only are required to be attached to each waggon, who are\nnumbered 1, 2, 3, & 4.The frame and ammunition having been brought into the battery, or to\nany other place, concealed either by trees or houses (for from the\nfacility of taking new ground, batteries are not so indispensable as\nwith mortars), the words \u201c_Prepare for bombardment_\u201d are given; on\nwhich the frame is prepared for rearing, Nos.1 and 2 first fixing the\nchambers on the ladder; Nos.3 and 4 attaching the legs to the frame\nas it lies on the ground.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.The words \u201c_Rear frame_\u201d are then given;\nwhen all assist in raising it, and the proper elevation is given,\naccording to the words \u201c_Elevate to 35\u00b0_\u201d or \u201c_45\u00b0_,\u201d or whatever\nangle the officer may judge necessary, according to the required\nrange, by spreading or closing the legs of the frame, agreeable to\nthe distances marked in degrees on a small measuring tape, which the\nnon-commissioned officer carries, and which is called--the Elevating\nLine.The word \u201c_Point_\u201d is then given: which is done by means of a\nplumb-line, hanging down from the vertex of the triangle, and which at\nthe same time shews whether the frame is upright or not.1 and 2 place themselves at the foot of the ladder,\nand Nos.3 and 4 return to fix the ammunition in the rear, in readiness\nfor the word \u201c_Load_.\u201d When this is given, No.3 brings a Rocket to the\nfoot of the ladder, having before hand _carefully_ taken off the circle\nthat covered the vent, and handing it to No.1 has ascended the ladder to receive the first\nRocket from No.2, and to place it in the chamber at the top of the\nladder; by the time this is done, No.2 is ready to give him another\nRocket, which in like manner he places in the other chamber: he then\nprimes the locks with a tube and powder, and, cocking the two locks,\nafter every thing else is done, descends from the ladder, and, when\ndown, gives the word \u201c_Ready_;\u201d on which, he and No.2 each take one of\nthe trigger lines, and retire ten or twelve paces obliquely, waiting\nfor the word \u201c_Fire_\u201d from the officer or non-commissioned officer, on\nwhich they pull, either separately or together, as previously ordered.1 immediately runs up and\nspunges out the two chambers with a very wet spunge, having for this\npurpose a water bucket suspended at the top of the frame; which being\ndone, he receives a Rocket from No.3 having, in\nthe mean time, brought up a fresh supply; in doing which, however, he\nmust never bring from the rear more than are wanted for each round.In this routine, any number of rounds is tired, until the words\n\u201c_Cease firing_\u201d are given; which, if followed by those, \u201c_Prepare to\nretreat_,\u201d Nos.3 and 4 run forward to the ladder; and on the words\n_\u201cLower frame_,\u201d they ease it down in the same order in which it was\nraised, take it to pieces, and may thus retire in less than five\nminutes: or if the object of ceasing to fire is merely a change of\nposition to no great distance, the four men may with ease carry the\nframe, without taking it to pieces, the waggon following them with the\nammunition, or the ammunition being borne by men, as circumstances may\nrender expedient._The ammunition_ projected from this frame consists of 32-pounder\nRockets, armed with carcasses of the following sorts and ranges:--\n\n\n1st.--_The small carcass_, containing 8 lbs.of carcass composition,\nbeing 3 lbs.more than the present 10-inch spherical carcass.--Range\n3,000 yards.2nd.--_The medium carcass_, containing 12 lbs.of carcass composition,\nbeing equal to the present 13-inch.--Range 2,500 yards.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.3rd.--_The large carcass_, containing 18 lbs.of carcass composition,\nbeing 6 lbs.more than the present 13-inch spherical carcass.--Range\n2,000 yards.Or 32-pounder Rockets, armed with bursting cones, made of stout iron,\nfilled with powder, to be exploded by fuzes, and to be used to produce\nthe explosive effects of shells, where such effect is preferred to the\nconflagration of the carcass.These cones contain as follows:--\n\n_Small._--Five lbs.of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a\n10-inch shell.--Range 3,000 yards.of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a\n13-inch shell.--Range 2,500 yards.of powder.--Range 2,000 yards.I have lately had a successful experiment, with bombarding\nRockets, six inches diameter, and weighing 148 lbs.--and doubt not of\nextending the bombarding powers of the system much further.[Illustration: _Plate 6_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.2]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT, FROM EARTH WORKS, WITHOUT\nAPPARATUS.1, is a perspective view of a Battery, erected expressly\nfor throwing Rockets in bombardment, where the interior <DW72> has the\nangle of projection required, and is equal to the length of the Rocket\nand stick.The great advantage of this system is, that, as it dispenses with\napparatus: where there is time for forming a work of this sort, of\nconsiderable length, the quantity of fire, that may be thrown in a\ngiven time, is limited only by the length of the work: thus, as the\nRockets may be laid in embrasures cut in the bank, at every two feet, a\nbattery of this description, 200 feet in length, will fire 100 Rockets\nin a volley, and so on; or an incessant and heavy fire may, by such\na battery, be kept up from one flank to the other, by replacing the\nRockets as fast as they are fired in succession.The rule for forming this battery is as follows.\u201cThe length of the interior <DW72> of this work is half formed by the\nexcavation, and half by the earth thrown out; for the base therefore of\nthe interior <DW72> of the part to be raised, at an angle of 55\u00b0, set\noff two thirds of the intended perpendicular height--cut down the <DW72>\nto a perpendicular depth equal to the above mentioned height--then\nsetting off, for the breadth of the interior excavation, one third more\nthan the intended thickness of the work, carry down a regular ramp\nfrom the back part of this excavation to the foot of the <DW72>, and\nthe excavation will supply the quantity of earth necessary to give the\nexterior face a <DW72> of 45\u00b0.\u201d\n\nFig.2 is a perspective view of a common epaulement converted into a\nRocket battery.In this case, as the epaulement is not of sufficient\nlength to support the Rocket and stick, holes must be bored in the\nground, with a miner\u2019s borer, of a sufficient depth to receive the\nsticks, and at such distances, and such an angle, as it is intended\nto place the Rockets for firing.The inside of the epaulement must be\npared away to correspond with this angle, say 55\u00b0.The Rockets are then\nto be laid in embrasures, formed in the bank, as in the last case.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football there.Where the ground is such as to admit of using the borer, this latter\nsystem, of course, is the easiest operation; and for such ground as\nwould be likely to crumble into the holes, slight tubes are provided,\nabout two feet long, to preserve the opening; in fact, these tubes will\nbe found advantageous in all ground.2 also shews a powerful mode of defending a field work by means of\nRockets, in addition to the defences of the present system; merely by\ncutting embrasures in the glacis, for horizontal firing.[Illustration: _Plate 7_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.2]\n\n\n\n\nA ROCKET AMBUSCADE.1, represents one of the most important uses that can be\nmade of Rockets for field service; it is that of the Rocket Ambuscade\nfor the defence of a pass, or for covering the retreat of an army,\nby placing any number, hundreds or thousands, of 32 or 24-pounder\nshell Rockets, or of 32-pounder Rockets, armed with 18-pounder shot,\nlimited as to quantity only by the importance of the object, which\nis to be obtained; as by this means, the most extensive destruction,\neven amounting to annihilation, may be carried amongst the ranks of an\nadvancing enemy, and that with the exposure of scarcely an individual.The Rockets are laid in rows or batteries of 100 or 500 in a row,\naccording to the extent of ground to be protected.They are to be\nconcealed either in high grass, or masked in any other convenient\nway; and the ambuscade may be formed of any required number of these\nbatteries, one behind the other, each battery being prepared to be\ndischarged in a volley, by leaders of quick match: so that one man is,\nin fact, alone sufficient to fire the whole in succession, beginning\nwith that nearest to the enemy, as soon as he shall have perceived\nthem near enough to warrant his firing.Where the batteries are very\nextensive, each battery may be sub-divided into smaller parts, with\nseparate trains to each, so that the whole, or any particular division\nof each battery, may be fired, according to the number and position of\nthe enemy advancing.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Trains, or leaders, are provided for this service,\nof a particular construction, being a sort of flannel saucissons,\nwith two or three threads of slow match, which will strike laterally\nat all points, and are therefore very easy of application; requiring\nonly to be passed from Rocket to Rocket, crossing the vents, by which\narrangement the fire running along, from vent to vent, is sure to\nstrike every Rocket in quick succession, without their disturbing each\nothers\u2019 direction in going off, which they might otherwise do, being\nplaced within 18 inches apart, if all were positively fired at the same\ninstant.2 is a somewhat similar application, but not so much in the nature\nof an ambuscade as of an open defence.Here a very low work is thrown\nup, for the defence of a post, or of a chain of posts, consisting\nmerely of as much earth and turf as is sufficient to form the sides of\nshallow embrasures for the large Rockets, placed from two to three feet\napart, or nearer; from which the Rockets are supposed to be discharged\nindependently, by a certain number of artillery-men, employed to keep\nup the fire, according to the necessity of the case.It is evident, that by this mode, an incessant and tremendous fire may\nbe maintained, which it would be next to impossible for an advancing\nenemy to pass through, not only from its quantity and the weight and\ndestructive nature of the ammunition, but from the closeness of its\nlines and its contiguity to the ground; leaving, in fact, no space in\nfront which must not be passed over and ploughed up after very few\nrounds.As both these operations are supposed to be employed in defensive\nwarfare, and therefore in fixed stations, there is no difficulty\ninvolved in the establishment of a sufficient dep\u00f4t of ammunition for\ncarrying them on upon the most extensive scale; though it is obviously\nimpossible to accomplish any thing approaching this system of defence,\nby the ordinary means of artillery.[Illustration: _Plate 8_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.2]\n\n\n\n\nTHE USE OF ROCKETS IN THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF FORTIFIED PLACES.1, represents the advanced batteries and approaches in\nthe attack of some fortress, where an imperfect breach being supposed\nto have been made in the salient angle of any bastion, large Rockets,\nweighing each from two to three hundred weight or more, and being each\nloaded with not less than a barrel of powder, are fired into the ruins\nafter the revetment is broken, in order, by continual explosions, to\nrender the breach practicable in the most expeditious way.To insure\nevery Rocket that is fired having the desired effect, they are so\nheavily laden, as not to rise off the ground when fired along it; and\nunder these circumstances are placed in a small shallow trench, run\nalong to the foot of the glacis, from the nearest point of the third\nparallel, and in a direct line for the breach: by this means, the\nRockets being laid in this trench will invariably pursue exactly the\nsame course, and every one of them will be infallibly lodged in the\nbreach.It is evident, that the whole of this is intended as a night\noperation, and a few hours would suffice, not only for running forward\nthe trench, which need not be more than 18 inches deep, and about nine\ninches wide, undiscovered, but also for firing a sufficient number of\nRockets to make a most complete breach before the enemy could take\nmeans to prevent the combinations of the operation.From the experiments I have lately made, I have reason to believe, that\nRockets much larger than those above mentioned may be formed for this\ndescription of service--Rockets from half a ton to a ton weight; which\nbeing driven in very strong and massive cast iron cases, may possess\nsuch strength and force, that, being fired by a process similar to\nthat above described, even against the revetment of any fortress,\nunimpaired by a cannonade, it shall, by its mass and form, pierce the\nsame; and having pierced it, shall, with one explosion of several\nbarrels of powder, blow such portion of the masonry into the ditch, as\nshall, with very few rounds, complete a practicable breach.It is evident, from this view of the weapon, that the Rocket System is\nnot only capable of a degree of portability, and facility for light\nmovements, which no weapon possesses, but that its ponderous parts, or\nthe individual masses of its ammunition, also greatly exceed those of\nordinary artillery.And yet, although this last description of Rocket\nammunition appears of an enormous mass, as ammunition, still if it be\nfound capable of the powers here supposed, of which _I_ have little\ndoubt, the whole weight to be brought in this way against any town, for\nthe accomplishment of a breach, will bear _no comparison_ whatever to\nthe weight of ammunition now required for the same service, independent\nof the saving of time and expense, and the great comparative simplicity\nof the approaches and works required for a siege carried on upon this\nsystem.This class of Rockets I propose to denominate the _Belier a\nfe\u00f9_.2 represents the converse of this system, or the use of these\nlarger Rockets for the defence of a fortress by the demolition of the\nbatteries erected against it.In this case, the Rockets are fired from\nembrasures, in the crest of the glacis, along trenches cut a part of\nthe way in the direction of the works to be demolished.[Illustration: _Plate 9_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.2]\n\n\n\n\nOF THE USE OF ROCKETS BY INFANTRY AGAINST CAVALRY, AND IN COVERING THE\nSTORMING OF A FORTRESS.1, represents an attack of cavalry against infantry,\nrepulsed by the use of Rockets.These Rockets are supposed to be of the\nlightest nature, 12 or 9-pounders, carried on bat horses or in small\ntumbrils, or with 6-pounder shell Rockets, of which one man is capable\nof carrying six in a bundle, for any peculiar service; or so arranged,\nthat the flank companies of every regiment may be armed, each man, with\nsuch a Rocket, in addition to his carbine or rifle, the Rocket being\ncontained in a small leather case, attached to his cartouch, slinging\nthe carbine or rifle, and carrying the stick on his shoulder, serving\nhim either as a spear, by being made to receive the bayonet, or as a\nrest for his piece.By this means every battalion would possess a powerful battery of\nthis ammunition, _in addition_ to all its ordinary means of attack\nand defence, and with scarcely any additional burthen to the flank\ncompanies, the whole weight of the Rocket and stick not exceeding six\npounds, and the difference between the weight of a rifle and that of a\nmusket being about equivalent.As to the mode of using them in action,\nfor firing at long ranges", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "And, as it is well known, how successfully\ncharges of cavalry are frequently sustained by infantry, even by the\nfire of the musket alone, it is not presuming too much to infer, that\nthe repulse of cavalry would be _absolutely certain_, by masses of\ninfantry, possessing the additional aid of powerful vollies of these\nshell Rockets.So also in charges of infantry, whether the battalion so\narmed be about to charge, or to receive a charge, a well-timed volley\nof one or two hundred such Rockets, judiciously thrown in by the flank\ncompanies, must produce the most decisive effects.Neither can it be\ndoubted, that in advancing to an attack, the flank companies might\nmake the most formidable use of this arm, mixed with the fire of their\nrifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur man\u0153uvres.In\nlike manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party,\nor for the establishment of a _tete-du-pont_, and generally on all such\noccasions, Rockets will be found capable of the greatest service, as\nshewn the other day in passing the Adour.In short, I must here remark\nthat the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no more limited\nthan the use of gunpowder itself.2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by\nmeans of Rockets.These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both\ncarcass and shell Rockets; the former fired in great quantities from\nthe trenches at high angles; the latter in ground ranges in front of\nthe third parallel.It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in\nany place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or\nthree vollies quickly repeated, must be most favourable, either to the\nstorming of a particular breach, or to a general escalade.I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest\nstress upon the use of this arm _in great quantities_, it is not\ntherefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual Rocket\ncarcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as\nthe 10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the\n10-inch spherical carcass: or that the explosion of a shell thrown by a\nRocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion of that same shell\nthrown by any other means: but that, as the power of _instantaneously_\nthrowing the _most unlimited_ quantities of carcasses or shells is the\n_exclusive property_ of this weapon, and as there can be no question\nthat an infinitely greater effect, both physical[A] as well as moral,\nis produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity of\nammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow\nsuccession of that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity,\nand a downright waste of power, not to make this exclusive property the\ngeneral basis of every application of the weapon, limited only by a due\nproportion between the expenditure and the value of the object to be\nattained--a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to\nexceed than to fall short of.[A] For a hundred fires breaking out at once, must necessarily\n        produce more destruction than when they happen in\n        succession, and may therefore be extinguished as fast as\n        they occur.There is another most important use in this weapon, in the storming of\nfortified places, which should here be mentioned, viz.that as it is\nthe only description of artillery ammunition that can ever be carried\ninto a place by a storming party, and as, in fact, the heaviest Rockets\nmay accompany an escalade, so the value of it in these operations is\ninfinite, and no escalade should ever be attempted without.It would\nenable the attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only\nto scour the parapet most effectually, and to enfilade any street or\npassage where they may be opposed, and which they may wish to force;\nbut even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the garrison,\nwhile it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as\nto the situation and progress of each party.[Illustration: _Plate 10_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.2]\n\n\n\n\nTHE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.Plate 11 represents two men of war\u2019s launches throwing Rockets.The\nframe is the same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of\nthe legs or prypoles, on which it is supported in land service; for\nwhich, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.To render,\ntherefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal,\neach of them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it\nwith the mast, and guide it in lowering and raising, which is done by\nthe haulyards.The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the\nframe being elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into\nthe stern sheets, and a marine artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by\na trigger-line, leading aft.In the second boat, these artillery-men\nare in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to\na convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail\nset, but partly brailed up.This sail being kept wet, most effectually\nprevents, without the least danger to the sail, any inconvenience to\nthe men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket when going off;\nit should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of\nwind.It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself\ndischarged some hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a\nsix-oared cutter, without it.From this application of the sail, it is\nevident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats under sail, as\nwell as at anchor, or in rowing.In the launch, the ammunition may be\nvery securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or\ntanned hides.In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and\nan attending boat is therefore necessary: on which account, as well as\nfrom its greater steadiness, the launch is preferable, where there is\nno obstacle as to currents or shoal water.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the\nmarine, that as the power of discharging this ammunition without the\nburthen of ordnance, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for land service,\nso also, its property of being projected without reaction upon the\npoint of discharge, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for sea service:\ninsomuch, that Rockets conveying the same quantity of combustible\nmatter, as by the ordinary system would be thrown from the largest\nmortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used out of the\nsmallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been\nfrequently fired even from four-oared gigs.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell\nRockets recoch\u00e9t in the water remarkably well at low angles.There is\nanother use for Rockets in boat service also, which ought not to be\npassed over--namely, their application in facilitating the capture of a\nship by boarding.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short\nstick, having a leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the\nRocket.Thus prepared, every boat intended to board is provided with\n10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of coming alongside, the fuzes\nare lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately launched by\nhand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own\nimpulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode,\nso as very shortly to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual\ndestruction, and by the equally powerful operation of terror amongst\nthe crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a few seconds, until, by\nthe explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired effect\nhas been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when\nthey enter the vessel.[Illustration: _Plate 11_]\n\n\n\n\nTHE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER\nSHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships;\nby which, a great power of _distant_ conflagration is given to these\nships, in addition to the limited powers they now possess, as depending\nentirely on _contact_ with the vessels they may be intended to destroy.The application is made as follows:--Frames or racks are to be provided\nin the tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and\nshell Rockets, as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly\nclose together.These racks may also be applied in the topmast and\ntop-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives\nfor sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these\nracks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents\nuncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which\ncan be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged\nmerely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a\nconsiderable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen\nto the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will\nhave returned into safety before any discharge takes place.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.It is\nevident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be\ncalculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the\nfire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies\u2019 ships: when issuing in\nthe most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to\nhave less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it\nis impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships\nenough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with\nclouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power\nof destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass\nharmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies\u2019 boats\nin towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely\nprecluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any\nboat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth\nshell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.I had\nan opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French\nFleet in Basque Roads, and though on a very small scale indeed, it was\nascertained, that the greatest confusion and terror was created by it\nin the enemy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire\nRockets, from scuttles in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every\nvessel having a between-deck, a Rocket battery, in addition to the\ngun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in the\nsmallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship;\nthe sparks of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either\nby iron shutters closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the\nGalgo defence ship, fitted with 21 Rocket scuttles in her broadside,\nas shewn in Fig.3; or by a particular construction of scuttle and\nframe which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop of\nwar: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all\npositions of traverse, and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any\npossibility of the entrance of fire completely prevented.In both these\nships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the highest angles, for\nbombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence\nor defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used,\nare capable of projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4\u00bd-inch shells, or even\n24-pounder solid shot.This arrangement literally gives the description\nof small vessels here mentioned, a second and most powerful deck, for\ngeneral service as well as for bombardment.Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be\nfitted to fire Rockets by frames, similar to the boat frames, described\nin Plate 11, from their spar deck, and either over the broadside or\nthe stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and down, on a\nsmall upright spar or boat\u2019s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside\nof the bulwark of the vessel.As a temporary expedient, or in small\nvessels, this mode answers very well; but it has the objection of not\ncarrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as when fired from below:\nit interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and\ncan therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment.All the gun brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore\nOWEN\u2019s command there, were fitted in this manner, some with two and\nsome with three frames on a broadside.[Illustration: _Plate 12_\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0Fig.\u00a03\u00a0\u00a0Fig.4]\n\n\n\n\nROCKET AMMUNITION.Plate 13 represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition\nwhich have hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion\nRocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell\nRocket, and shews the comparative dimensions of the whole.This Ammunition may be divided into three parts--the heavy, medium, and\nlight natures.The _heavy natures_ are those denominated by the number\nof inches in their diameter; the _medium_ from the 42-pounder to the\n24-pounder inclusive; and the _light natures_ from the 18-pounder to\nthe 6-pounder inclusive.The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are\nfrom 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter,\nor bursting powder, from 25lbs.Their sticks\nare divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and carried in\nthe angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in\neach case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole\nof this heavy part of the system possesses, in proportion, the same\nfacility as the medium and light parts.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.These Rockets are fired from\nbombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder carcasses;\nor they may be fired from a <DW72> of earth in the same way.They may\nalso be fired along the ground, as explained in Plate 9, for the\npurposes of explosion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less\ndiameter, even more penetration than the heaviest shells, and are\ntherefore equally efficient for the destruction of bomb proofs, or the\ndemolition of strong buildings; and their construction having now been\nrealized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not\nits only excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses\nthan can be done by any other means; that is to say, masses, to project\nwhich, it would be scarcely possible to cast, much less to transport,\nmortars of sufficient magnitude.Various modifications of the powers\nof these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to\nspecify.The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally\nused in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of\nbombardment, will be found sufficient, while their portability renders\nthem in that respect more easily applied.I have therefore classed them\nas medium Rockets.These Rockets will convey from ten to seven pounds\nof combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards; and\nmay, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required,\neither for penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations\nof three, four, or six Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks\nin the centre also strongly bound together.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.The great art of firing\nthese _fasces of Rockets_ is to arrange them, so that they may be\nsure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by\npriming the bottoms of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of\npowder, which is sure to ignite the whole combination at once.The 42\nand 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion Rockets, and the\n32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range\nat least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5\u00bd-inch\nhowitzer shell, or an 18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the\nleast Rocket used as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed\neither with shot or shell, for field service.The 24-pounder Rocket is\nvery nearly equal to it in all its applications in the field; from the\nsaving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable.It is perfectly\nequal to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.The 18-pounder, which is the first of the _light_ natures of Rockets,\nis armed with a 9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a\n6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder with a grenade; and the 6-pounder\nwith a 3-pounder shot or shell.These shells, however, are now cast\nexpressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of\nspherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing\nthe resistance of the air.From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description\nof case shot Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity\nof musket or carbine balls, put into the top of the cylinder of the\nRocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of powder contained\nin a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is\nincreased beyond that of the Rocket\u2019s motion, an effect which cannot be\ngiven in the spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates\nthe balls.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained\nin a wrought iron head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in\nthe shell above mentioned, for field service, or in the case shot,\nare fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from\nthe vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired.These fuses may be\ninstantaneously cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards,\nby a pair of common scissars or nippers, and communicate to the\nbursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on the outside of the\nRocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a wooden\nfuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can\nbe necessary, is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is\nregulated either by taking away the paper fuse altogether, or leaving\nany part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and permanent wooden\nfuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.By\nthis system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a\nfacility, security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar\noperations.All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient\nlength for carriage, and jointed by iron ferules.For sea service they\nare made in the whole length.The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose\nissuing in future for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell\nand case shot for the light field carriages; the 12-pounder for the\nmounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and 6-pounders for infantry,\naccording to the different cases already explained.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements\nused for jointing the sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of\ndifferent sizes, in proportion to the different natures to which they\nbelong.They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches, all to\naccomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into\nthe stick, by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix\nit immoveably.The varieties are here all shewn, because I have not\nhitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk.10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the\ndifferent natures of ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of\nspeculation, but which may in certain parts of the system be hereafter\nfound a considerable improvement.It is the carrying the Rocket, or\nprojectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of\ncombining them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.11, 12, and 13, are respectively\na shell, case shot, or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the\nRocket by a screw, according as either the one or the other nature is\nrequired at the time.A greater variety of ammunition might thus be\ncarried for particular services, with a less burthen altogether.14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket.This is supposed to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as\nin Fig.12, a parachute with a light ball or carcass attached to it by\na slight chain.This Rocket being fired nearly perpendicularly into the\nair, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small\nexplosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the\nparachute; but by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended\nin the air, as Fig.13, in which situation, as a light ball, it will\ncontinue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the atmosphere\nfor nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will\nfloat in the air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived\nand unconsumed, if only the match of the carcass be ignited at the\ndisengagement of the parachute.It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is\nnot only the most secure, but the most durable that can be: every\nRocket is, in fact, a charge of powder hermetically sealed in a metal\ncase, impervious either to the ordinary accidents by fire, or damage\nfrom humidity.I have used Rockets that had been three years on board\nof ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain\nperiod, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less\nthan eight or ten years, their force shall have so far suffered as to\nrender them unserviceable, they may again be regenerated, at the mere\nexpense of boring out the composition and re-driving it: the stick,\ncase, &c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as serviceable\nas ever.[Illustration: _Plate 13_ Figs.1\u201315]\n\n\n_The Ranges of these different Natures of Rocket Ammunition are as\nfollow:_\n\n

to its Application in Bombardment and in the Field.So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the\nexpense of the Rocket system, it is very important, for the true\nunderstanding of the weapon, to prove, that it is by far the cheapest\nmode of applying artillery ammunition, both in bombardment and in the\nfield.To begin with the expense of making the 32-pounder Rocket Carcass,\nwhich has hitherto been principally used in bombardments, compared with\nthe 10-inch Carcass, which conveys even less combustible matter._s._  _d._\n                            {Case

and if bamboo were substituted, which I am\nendeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each\n32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16_s._ each.Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of\nthe projectile force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the\ncomparison, to the cost of the spherical carcass must be added that of\nthe charge of powder required to convey it the same distance.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom._s._  _d._\n  Cost of a 10-inch      { Value of a 10-inch spherical\n  Spherical Carcass,     {   carcass

                   ------------\n\n\nSo that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an\nactual saving in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains\nmore composition than the 10-inch spherical carcass, _without allowing\nany thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket apparatus, and\nthat of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &c._ which, together\nwith the difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of\nthrowing the common carcass; whereas, the cost of apparatus for the\nuse of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed \u00a35; and indeed,\non most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even\nwithout any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that\na transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with\nevery thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while\non shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the\nrequisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the\n10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need\nspecifying.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,\nwhen compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch\nspherical carcass costs \u00a31.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.17_s._ 11\u00bd_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the\n32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible\nmatter, does not cost more than \u00a31.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case\nthere is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11\u00bd_d._ Now the large\nRocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the\ndifference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the\ndifferent quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the\ndifference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least\ndouble, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the\nother comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15\nto 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in\nthe first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate\neconomy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to\nthe still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the\nfirst cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than \u00a33.10_s._ that is to\nsay, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,\nthough its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter\nconveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration\nare half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is\nevident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets\nmay be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling\nmass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch\nshell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or\nconflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the\nfirst cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a\ncomparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the\nRocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average\nexpense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the\nenemy; but it is generally", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "But as to the Rocket\nand its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is\nthat of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly\nstated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under\nany circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by\n32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving\nof \u00a33 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger\nnatures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the\nspherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but\ngreatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,\nas the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not\nworthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired\nfrom a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each\nother, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a\nseries of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the\nground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some\naccident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to\nsay, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing\nof shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the\nRocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is\nscarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion\nof the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the\nsaving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with\nreference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the\nlarge mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole\nestablishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their\nunfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every\nvessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without\nany alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her\ngeneral services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket\nin bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense\nof this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common\nartillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the\nRocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired\nfrom field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily\nused by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make\nthe calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common\nammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small\nRocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give\nhorizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the\ngun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be\nstated as follows:--\n\n                                           \u00a3.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom._s._  _d._\n                      {Case and stick      0    5     6\n  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10\u00bd\n                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0\n                                          --------------\n                                          \u00a30    9     4\u00bd\n                                          --------------\n\nBut this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting\nelementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of\nthe stick._s._  _d._\n                    {Case and stick  0   4     0\n  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10\u00bd\n                    {Driving         0   0     6\n                                    -------------\n                                    \u00a30   6     4\u00bd\n                                    -------------\n\n    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general\n        calculation of the advantages of which the system is\n        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether\nprojected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket;

so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged\nwith the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can\n_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the\nuse of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,\ntransport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,\nor of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What\nproportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and\nthe average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to\nthe heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It\nis a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not\namount to less than \u00a320 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the\npay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from\n\u00a32 to \u00a33 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not\nperhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that\nthe saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the\nfield as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare\nquestion of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not\nthe balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_\nfacilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_\nof the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire\nto be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by\nany possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to\nall these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be\nstated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the\nobjection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it\nmust be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of\ntarget-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,\nwhich possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any\npoint: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against\nthe Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in\nits favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,\nthat the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,\ninstead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,\nconsequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell\nbeing projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative\ninaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still\nfurther be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that\nmuch has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every\nreason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually\nbrought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the\nimportant purposes of field service.Transcriber\u2019s Notes\n\n\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:\n\n  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but \u201cas\n  follow\u201d (singular) in the table\u2019s title was printed that way in\n  the original.The column heading \u201c55 to 60\u00b0\u201d was misprinted as \u201c55 to 66\u00b0\u201d;\n  corrected here.At the same\ntime, and while waiting for the full effect of the narcotic, efforts\ncan be directed to giving ease to the muscular spasms and pain by brisk\nfriction with stimulating lotions or by mustard poultices to the\nabdomen and extremities.The morphia will be the best and quickest\nstimulant which can be used; it will therefore be useless in most cases\nto administer brandy, camphor, chloroform, {725} or other remedies of\nthat sort.Waiting and giving nothing by the mouth is the wiser course.In twenty minutes to half an hour the most perfect bien etre succeeds\nto the previous agony and exhaustion.In some cases the vomiting,\npurging, and cramps cease more gradually, and six hours will pass\nbefore the patient is at ease.The intense thirst is best treated by\nthe giving of cracked ice sparingly at first, more freely later.Nothing substitutes morphia hypodermically with success, but in some\ninstances or when the stomach is not very irritable it may be necessary\nto give medicine by the mouth.In this case chloroform (xv to xxx\ndrops), chlorodyne (x to xx drops), or spirits of camphor (v to x\ndrops) every quarter or half hour in ice-water may be directed.Chloroform and camphor can be combined with the deodorized tincture of\nopium in ten- to twenty-drop doses.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.Time is wasted in expecting relief\nfrom remedies which are inevitably rejected as soon as taken; it is\nonly when the stomach is very tolerant that it is judicious to begin\nwith them.The weakness of the heart's action must be combated by brandy or\nwhiskey, given by the mouth with pounded ice or administered\nhypodermically.A considerable quantity of brandy or diluted alcohol\nmay be introduced by repeated injections beneath the skin.Iced\nchampagne may be tried with good effect.H. C. Wood quotes Hall[18] as\nrecommending hypodermic injections of chloral in the cold stage of\ncholera.Five to eight grains in twenty minims of distilled water can\nbe thus given, and repeated at intervals of fifteen to twenty minutes\nuntil some effect is perceived.[Footnote 18: _Lancet_, May 2, 1874.]If vomiting persists after the other symptoms--pain and muscular\nspasms--are relieved, it is due to the intense gastric hyperaemia;\ngiving nothing which is not necessary is the wiser plan.Carbolic acid,\nhydrocyanic acid, bismuth, bromide of sodium, or small doses of calomel\nare remedies which meet the indication.Food should be withheld as long\nas possible; then iced barley-water, followed by milk and lime-water in\nvery small quantities at short intervals, will test the power of the\nstomach to retain and digest food.{726}\n\nINTESTINAL AFFECTIONS OF CHILDREN IN HOT WEATHER.BY J. LEWIS SMITH, M.D.The summer affections of the intestines in children are chiefly of a\ndiarrhoeal character.Diarrhoeal attacks, as is well known, are much\nmore frequent and severe in the summer months than in other portions of\nthe year.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Moreover, the diarrhoea of the summer season occurs chiefly\namong children under the age of two and a half years, and is much more\ncommon and fatal in the cities than in the country.In the large cities\nthis malady has heretofore been the annually-recurring scourge of\ninfancy, but of late years its prevalence has been in some degree\ndiminished and its severity controlled by the establishment of health\nboards and the enforcement of sanitary regulations.Still, it remains\nan important disease in all our cities, and one that largely increases\nthe aggregate mortality.The truth of this statement is shown by the\nstatistics of deaths taken at random from the mortuary records of any\nlarge city.Thus, in New York City during 1882 the deaths from\ndiarrhoea reported to the Health Board, tabulated in months, were as\nfollows:\n\n        Jan.Under\n  five   34   32   50   50   72   231  1533  817   362  195   68   35\n  years.Over\n  five   14   15   14   20   15    19   131  149    84   55   31   24\n  years.Therefore, in 1882--and the statistics of other years correspond in\nthis particular--it is seen that nine times as many deaths of children\nunder the age of five years occurred from diarrhoea during the five\nmonths from June 1st to October 31st as in the remaining seven months\nof the year.It is also seen, in corroboration of the statement that\ndiarrhoea due to hot weather is chiefly a disease of infancy and early\nchildhood, that during these same five months, which embrace the summer\nseason, the number of deaths from diarrhoea under the age of five years\nwas seven and a half times greater than the number over that age.These\nstatistics agree with the general experience of physicians in city\npractice.The summer diarrhoea would indeed be comparatively\nunimportant were its death-rate as low in the first five years of life\nas subsequently.The following statistics show how great a destruction of life this\nmalady causes even under the surveillance of an energetic health board;\nand before this board was established it was much greater, as I had\nabundant opportunities to observe.The last annual report of the New\nYork Board of Health was made in 1875, since which time weekly\nbulletins have been {727} issued.The deaths from diarrhoea at all ages\nin the three last years in which annual reports were issued were as\nfollows:\n\n              1873.January       94     43     46\n  February      84     34     52\n  March         97     40     58\n  April        114     47     45\n  May           95     61     89\n  June         220    144    157\n  July        1514   1205   1387\n  August       967   1007   1012\n  September    424    587    608\n  October      213    255    185\n  November      87    105     57\n  December      53     56     50\n\nThus, in these three years the aggregate deaths from diarrhoea during\nthe months from June to October inclusive, in which months the summer\ndiarrhoea prevails, were 9885, while in the remaining seven months the\nnumber was only 1407.How large a proportion of these deaths in the\nwarm season occurred in children we may infer from remarks made by the\nHealth Board in regard to another year.In their annual report for 1870\nthe board state: \"The mortality from the diarrhoeal affections amounted\nto 2789, or 33 per cent.of the total deaths; and of these deaths 95\nper cent.occurred in children less than five years old, 92 per cent.in children less than two years old, and 67 per cent.Every year the reports of the Health Board furnish\nsimilar statistics, but enough have been given to show how great a\nsacrifice of life the summer complaint produces annually in this city.What we observe in New York in reference to this disease is true also,\nto a greater or less extent, in other cities of this country and\nEurope, so far as we have reports.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.Not in every city is there the same\nproportionate mortality from this cause as in New York, but the\nfrequency of the summer diarrhoea and the mortality which attends it\nrender it an important disease in, I believe, most cities of both\ncontinents.In country towns, whether in villages or farm-houses, this\ndisease is comparatively unimportant, inasmuch as few cases occur in\nthem, and the few that do occur are of mild type, and consequently much\nless fatal than in the cities.The comparative immunity of the rural districts has an important\nrelation, as we will see, to the hygienic management of these cases.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.ETIOLOGY.--In the causation of this disease two distinct factors are\nrecognized--the one atmospheric, the other dietetic.The prevalence and severity of the summer diarrhoea correspond closely\nwith the degree of atmospheric heat, as may be inferred from the\nforegoing statistics.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.In New York this disease begins in the month of\nMay--earlier in some years than in others--in a few scattered cases,\ncommonly of a mild type.Cases become more and more numerous and severe\nas the weather grows warmer until July and August, when the diarrhoea\nattains its maximum prevalence and severity.In these two months it is\nby far the most frequent and fatal of all the diseases in cities.In\nthe middle of September new patients begin to be less common, and in\nthe latter part of this month and subsequently new cases do not occur,\nunless under unusual circumstances which favor the development of this\nmalady.In New York a considerable number of deaths {728} of infants\noccur from the diarrhoea in October.October is not a hot month in our\nlatitude--its average temperature is lower than that of May--and yet\nthe mortality from this disease is considerably larger in the former\nthan in the latter month.This fact, which seems to show that the\nprevalence of the summer diarrhoea does not correspond with the degree\nof atmospheric heat, is readily explained.The mortality in October,\nand indeed in the latter part of September, is not that of new cases,\nbut is mainly of infants, as I have observed every year, who contract\nthe disease in July or August or earlier, and linger in a state of\nemaciation and increasing weakness till they finally succumb, some even\nin cool weather.The fact is therefore undisputed, and is universally admitted, that the\nsummer season, stated in a general way, is the cause of this\nannually-recurring diarrhoeal epidemic, but it is not so easy to\ndetermine what are the exact causative conditions or agents which the\nsummer weather brings into activity.That atmospheric heat does not in\nitself cause the diarrhoea is evident from the fact that in the rural\ndistricts there is the same intensity of heat as in the cities, and yet\nthe summer complaint does not occur.The cause must be looked for in\nthat state of the atmosphere engendered by heat where unsanitary\nconditions exist, as in large cities.Moreover, observations show that\nthe noxious effluvia with which the air becomes polluted under such\ncircumstances constitute or contain the morbific agent.Thus, in one of\nthe institutions of this city a few years since, on May 10, which\nhappened to be an unusually warm day for this month, an offensive odor\nwas noticed in the wards, which was traced to a large manure-heap that\nwas being upturned in an adjacent garden.On this day four young\nchildren were severely attacked by diarrhoea, and one died.Many other\nexamples might be cited showing how the foul air of the city during the\nhot months, when animal and vegetable decomposition is most active,\ncauses diarrhoea.Several years since, while serving as sanitary\ninspector for the Citizens' Association in one of the city districts,\nmy attention was particularly called to one of the streets, in which a\nhouse-to-house visitation disclosed the fact that nearly every infant\nbetween two avenues had the diarrhoea, and usually in a severe form,\nnot a few dying.This street was compactly built with wooden\ntenement-houses on each side, and contained a dense population, mainly\nforeign, poor, ignorant, and filthy in their habits.It had no sewer,\nand the refuse of the kitchens and bed-chambers was thrown into the\nstreet, where it accumulated in heaps.Water trickled down over the\nsidewalks from the houses into the gutters or was thrown out as slops,\nso that it kept up a constant moisture of the refuse matter which\ncovered the street, and promoted the decay of the animal and vegetable\nsubstances which it contained.The air in the domicils and street under\nsuch conditions of impurity was necessarily foul in the extreme, and\nstifling during the hot days and nights of July and August; and it was\nevidently the important factor in producing the numerous and severe\ndiarrhoeal cases which were in these domicils.In another locality, occupied by tripe-dealers and a low class of\nbutchers who carried on fat- and bone-boiling at night, the air was so\nfoul after dark that the peculiar impurity which tainted it could be\ndistinctly noticed in the mouth for a considerable time after a night\nvisit.In the street where {729} these nuisances existed and in\nadjacent streets the summer diarrhoea was very prevalent and\ndestructive to human life.Murchison states that twenty out of\ntwenty-five boys were affected with purging and vomiting from inhaling\nthe effluvia from the contents of an old drain near their school-room.Physicians are familiar with a similar fact showing this purgative\neffect of impure air--that the atmosphere of a dissecting-room often\ncauses diarrhoea in those otherwise healthy.The exact nature of the deleterious agent or agents in foul air which\ncause the diarrhoea, whether they be gases or organisms, has not been\nfully determined; but at a recent meeting of the Berliner Med.Gesellschaft, A. Baginsky made a report on the bacilli of cholera\ninfantum, which he states he has found both in the dejections and in\nthe intestinal mucous membrane in the bodies of those who have perished\nwith this disease.In the stools, along with numerous other organisms,\nBaginsky states that he found masses of zoogloea, and the same\norganisms he detected on the surface of the small intestines, and could\ntrace their wanderings as far as the submucous tissue.[1] But it is\nevidently very difficult to determine whether such organisms sustain a\ncausative relation to diarrhoea or spring into existence in consequence\nof the foul secretions and decomposing fecal matters which are present.[Footnote 1: _Allegem.The impurities in the air of a large city are very numerous.Among\nthose of a gaseous nature are sulphurous acid, sulphuric acid,\nsulphuretted hydrogen; various gases of the carbon group, as carbonic\nacid, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide; gases of the nitrogen\ngroup, as the acetate, sulphide, and carbonate of ammonium, nitrous and\nnitric acids; and at times compounds of phosphorus and chlorine\n(Parkes).A theory deserving consideration is that certain gaseous\nimpurities found in the air form purgative combinations.D. F. Lincoln,\nin his interesting paper on the atmosphere in the _Cyclopaedia of\nMedicine_, writes in regard to sulphuretted hydrogen: \"When in the air,\nfreely exposed to the contact of oxygen, it becomes sulphuric acid.Sulphide of ammonium in the same circumstances becomes a sulphate,\nwhich, encountering common salt (chloride of sodium), produces sulphate\nof sodium and chloride of ammonium.The sulphates form a characteristic\ningredient of the air in manufacturing districts.\"The sulphates, we\nknow, are for the most part purgatives, but whether they or other\nchemical agents exist in the respired air in sufficient quantity to\ndisturb the action of the intestines, even where atmospheric impurities\nare most abundant, is problematical and uncertain.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Again, the solid impurities in the air of a large city are very\nnumerous, as any one may observe by viewing a sunbeam in a darkened\nroom, which is made visible by the numerous particles floating in it.These particles consist largely of organic matter, which sometimes has\nbeen carried a long distance by the wind.The remarkable statement has\nbeen made that in the air of Berlin organic forms have been found of\nAfrican production.Ehrenberg discovered fragments of insects of\nvarious kinds--rhizopods, tardigrades, polygastrica, etc.--which,\nexisting in considerable quantity and inhaled in hot weather, when\ndecomposition and fermentation are most active, may be deleterious to\nthe system.Monads, bacteria, vibriones, amorphous dust containing\nspores which {730} retain their vitality for months, are among the\nsubstances found in the air of cities.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.The well-known hazy appearance\nof the atmosphere resting over a large city like New York when viewed\nfrom a distance is due to the gaseous and solid impurities with which\nthe air is so abundantly supplied--impurities which assume importance\nin pathological studies, since minute organisms are now believed to\ncause so many diseases the etiology of which has heretofore been\nobscure.With our present knowledge we must be content with the general\nstatement that impure air is one of the two important factors which\ncause summer diarrhoea, without being able to state positively which of\nthe elements in the air are most instrumental in causing this result.But the theory is plausible that minute organisms rather than chemical\nproducts are the chief cause.Henoch of Berlin, writing upon this\nsubject, calls attention to the disease known as intestinal mycosis,\nits prominent symptom being a severe diarrhoea produced by eating\ndiseased meat containing a fungus.He believes that \"a portion of the\nfungus not destroyed by the gastric juice settles upon different parts\nof the intestine, and there produces its effects;\" and he adds, \"At\npresent, however, we can regard the mykotic theory of cholera infantum\nonly as a very probable hypothesis.There is no doubt that high\natmospheric temperature increases the tendency to fermentation\ndyspepsias which is present in imperfectly-nourished children at all\nseasons, and causes them to appear not only epidemically, but also in\nan extremely acute form which is not frequent under ordinary\ncircumstances.This would lead to the conclusion that, in addition to\nthe heat, infectious germs are present, which, being developed in great\nmasses by the former, enter the stomach with the food.\"The fungus\ntheory of the causative relation of atmospheric heat to the diarrhoea\nof the summer season as thus explained by Henoch commands the readier\nassent since it comports with the well-known facts relating to the\netiology of the summer complaint.This disease, as we have seen, is\nmost prevalent and fatal under precisely those conditions of dense\npopulation, filthy domicils and streets, and atmospheric heat which are\nfavorable for the development of low organisms.In those portions of our cities which are occupied by the poor, more\nthan anywhere else, those conditions prevail which render the\natmosphere deleterious.One accustomed to the pure air of the country\nwould scarcely believe how stifling and poisonous the atmosphere\nbecomes during the hot summer days and close summer nights in and\naround the domicils in the poor quarters of the city.Among the causes\nof this foul air may be mentioned too dense a population, the occupancy\nof small rooms by large families, rigid economy and ceaseless endeavor\nto make ends meet, so that in the absorbing interest sanitary\nrequirements are sadly neglected.Adults of such families, and children\nof both sexes as soon as they are old enough, engage in laborious and\noften filthy occupations.Many of them seldom bathe, and they often\nwear for days the same undergarments, foul with perspiration and dirt.The intemperate, vicious, and indolent, who always abound in the\nquarters of the city poor, are notoriously filthy in their habits and\nadd to the insalubrity by their presence.Children old enough to be in\nthe streets and adults away at their occupations escape to a great\nextent the evil effects of impure air, but the infantile population\nalways suffer severely.Every physician who has witnessed the summer diarrhoea of infants is\n{731} aware of the fact that the mode of feeding has much to do with\nits occurrence.A large proportion of those who each summer fall\nvictims to it would doubtless escape if the feeding were exactly\nproper.In New York City facts like the following are of common\noccurrence in the practice of all physicians: Infants under the age of\neight months, if bottle-fed, nearly always contract diarrhoea, and\nusually of an obstinate character, during the summer months.The\nyounger the infant, the less able is it to digest any other food than\nbreast-milk, and the more liable is it therefore to suffer from\ndiarrhoea if bottle-fed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.In the institutions nearly every bottle-fed\ninfant under the age of four or even six months dies in the hot months\nwith symptoms of indigestion and intestinal catarrh, while the\nwet-nursed of the same ages remain well.Sudden weaning, the sudden\nsubstitution of cow's milk or any artificially-prepared food in place\nof breast-milk in hot weather, almost always produces diarrhoea, often\nof a severe and fatal nature.Feeding an infant in the hot months with\nindigestible and improper food, as fruits with seeds or the ordinary\ntable-food prepared in such a way that it overtaxes the digestive\nfunction of the infant, causes diarrhoea, and not infrequently that\nsevere form of it which will be described under the term cholera\ninfantum.Many obstinate cases of the summer complaint begin to improve\nunder change of diet, as by the substitution of one kind of milk for\nanother or the return of the infant to the breast after it has been\ntemporarily withdrawn from it.It is a common remark in the families of\nthe city poor that the second summer is the period of greatest danger\nto infants.This increased liability of infants to contract diarrhoea\nin the second summer is due to the fact that most infants in their\nsecond year are table-fed, while in the first year they are wet-nursed.Such facts, with which all physicians are familiar, show how important\nthe diet is as a factor in causing the summer complaint.Occasionally, from continued ill-health, the milk of the mother or\nwet-nurse does not agree with the nursling.Examined with the\nmicroscope, it is found to contain colostrum.Under such circumstances\nif a healthy wet-nurse be employed the diarrhoea ceases.It is very\nimportant that any woman furnishing breast-milk to an infant should\nlead a quiet and regular life, with regular meals and sleep.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.19, 1882, R. B. Gilbert relates\nstriking cases in which venereal excesses on the part of wet-nurses\nwere immediately followed by fatal diarrhoea in the infants which they\nsuckled.One not a resident would scarcely be able to appreciate the difficulty\nwhich is experienced in a large city in obtaining proper diet for young\nchildren, especially those of such an age that they require milk as the\nbasis of their food.Milk from cows stabled in the city or having a\nlimited pasturage near the city, and fed upon a mixture of hay with\ngarden and distillery products, the latter often largely predominating,\nis unsuitable.It is deficient in nutritive properties, prone to\nfermentation, and from microscopical and chemical examinations which\nhave been made it appears that it often contains deleterious\ningredients.If milk be obtained from distant farms where pasturage is\nfresh and abundant--and in New York City this is the usual source of\nthe supply--considerable time elapses before it is served to customers,\nso that, particularly in the hot months of July and August, it\nfrequently has begun to undergo {732} lactic-acid fermentation when the\ninfants receive it.That dispensed to families in the morning is the\nmilking of the previous morning and evening.The common result of the\nuse of this milk in midsummer by infants under the age of ten months is\nmore or less diarrhoea.The ill-success of feeding with cow's milk has led to the preparation\nof various kinds of food which the shops contain, but no dietetic\npreparation has yet appeared which agrees so well with the digestive\nfunction of the infant as breast-milk, and is at the same time\nsufficiently nutritive.In New York City improper diet, unaided by the conditions which hot\nweather produces, is a common cause of diarrhoea in young infants, for\nwe meet with this diarrhoea in infants who are bottle-fed at all\nseasons; but when the atmospheric conditions of hot weather and the use\nof food unsuitable for the age of the infant are both present and\noperative, this diarrhoea so increases in frequency and severity that\nit is proper to designate it the summer epidemic of the cities.Several\nyears since, before the New York Foundling Asylum was established, the\nfoundlings of New York, more than a thousand annually, were taken to\nthe almshouse on Blackwell's Island and consigned to the care of the\npauper-women, who were mostly old, infirm, and filthy in their habits\nand apparel.Their beds, in which the foundlings were also placed\nalongside of them, were seldom clean, not properly aired and washed,\nand under the beds", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "With such surroundings, the air which\nthese infants breathed day and night manifestly contained poisonous\nemanations; while their diet was equally improper, for it was prepared\nby these women from such milk and farinaceous food as were furnished\nthe almshouse.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.When assigned to duty in the almshouse, this service\nbeing at that time a branch of Charity Hospital, I was informed that\nall the foundlings died before the age of two months; one only was\npointed out as a curiosity which had been an exception to the rule.The\ndisease of which they perished was diarrhoea, and this malady in the\nsummer months was especially severe and rapidly fatal.The unpleasant\nexperiences in this institution furnished additional evidence, were any\nwanting, that foul air and improper diet are the two important factors\nin causing the summer diarrhoea of infants.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the milk there.Since that beneficial\ncharity, the New York Foundling Asylum, in East Sixty-eighth street,\ncame into existence, providing pure air and, for a considerable\nproportion of the foundlings, breast-milk, many of these waifs have\nbeen rescued from death.I have already stated that this disease occurs, with an occasional\nexception, under the age of two and a half years.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.The following table\nembraces all the cases that came to one of the city dispensaries during\nmy service between the months of May and October, inclusive:\n\n       Age.5 months or under         58\n   5 months to 12 months    212\n  12 months to 18 months    174\n  18 months to 24 months     93\n  24 months to 36 months     36\n                            ---\n        Total               573\n\nAfter the third year the liability to the summer complaint so rapidly\n{733} diminishes that comparatively few are affected by it.It is seen\nfrom the above statistics that by far the largest number of cases occur\nduring the period of first dentition; hence the prevalent opinion among\nfamilies that dentition causes the diarrhoea.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.It is the common belief\namong the poor of New York that diarrhoea occurring during dentition is\nconservative, and should not be checked.They believe that an infant\ncutting its teeth suffers less, and may be saved from serious illness,\nif it have frequent stools.Every summer I see infants reduced to a\nstate of imminent danger through the continuance of diarrhoea during\nseveral weeks, nothing having been done to check it in consequence of\nthis absurd belief.The progressive loss of flesh and strength and\nwasting of the features do not excite alarm, under the blinding\ninfluence of this theory, till the diarrhoea has continued so long and\nbecome so severe that it is with difficulty controlled, and the patient\nis in a state of real danger when the physician is first summoned.The\nfollowing statistics, which comprise cases occurring during my service\nin one of the city dispensaries, show the preponderance of cases during\nthe age when dental evolution is occurring:\n\n                                              Cases.No teeth and no marked turgescence of gums    47\n  Cutting incisors                             106\n     \"    anterior molars                       41\n     \"    canines                               40\n     \"    last molars                           20\n  All the teeth cut                             28\n                                               ---\n        Total                                  282\n\nIt so happens that the period of dental evolution corresponds with that\nof the most rapid development and the greatest functional activity of\nthe gastric and intestinal follicles, and the predisposition which\nexists to diarrhoeal maladies at this age must be attributed to this\ncause rather than to dentition.SYMPTOMS.--The summer diarrhoea of infants commonly begins gradually\nwith languor, fretfulness, and slight febrile movement.The diarrhoea\nat first usually attracts little attention from its mildness.The\nstools, while they are thinner than natural, vary in appearance, being\nyellow, brown, or green.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.Infants with milk diet are apt to pass green\nand acid stools containing particles of undigested casein.The tongue\nin the commencement of the attack is moist and covered with a slight\nfur.At a more advanced stage it may be moist, but is often dry, and in\ndangerous forms of the malady, accompanied by prostration, the buccal\nsurface is red and the gums more or less swollen and sometimes\nulcerated.It may commence simultaneously with the\ndiarrhoea, especially when food that is unusually indigestible and\nirritating to the stomach has been given, but more frequently this\nsymptom does not appear until the diarrhoea has continued a few days.I\npreserved memoranda of the date when vomiting began in the cases\ntreated in two consecutive summers, and found that ordinarily it was\ntoward the close of the first week.When it is an early and prominent\nsymptom it appears to be due to the presence in the stomach of\nimperfectly digested or fermented and acid food, which, when ejected,\ngives a decidedly acid reaction with appropriate tests.It contains\ncoagulated casein and undigested particles of whatever food has been\ngiven.In many patients the progressive loss of flesh and {734}\nstrength is largely due to the indigestion and vomiting by which the\nfood, which is so much required for proper nourishment, is lost.Emesis occurring at a late stage of the summer complaint is often due\nto commencing spurious hydrocephalus, which is not an infrequent\ncomplication, as we will see, of protracted cases.Perhaps when a late\nsymptom it may sometimes have an uraemic origin, for the urine is\nusually quite scanty in advanced cases.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.It seems probable, however,\nthat deleterious effects from non-elimination of urea are to a\nconsiderable extent prevented by the diarrhoea.The fecal evacuations may remain nearly uniform in appearance during\nthe disease, but in many patients they vary in color and consistence at\ndifferent periods.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.In the same case they may be brown and offensive at\none time, green at another, and again they may contain masses of a\nputty-like appearance, the partly-digested casein or altered epithelial\ncells.The stools sometimes consist largely of mucus, with or without\noccasional streaks of blood, indicating the predominance of\ninflammation in the colon.This is the mucous diarrhoea of Barrier.The\nstools are sometimes yellow when passed, but become green on exposure\nto the air from chemical reaction due to admixture with the urine.The character of the alvine discharges is interesting.In addition to\nundigested casein I have found epithelial cells, single or in clusters\n(sometimes regularly arranged as if detached in mass from the villi),\nfibres of meat, crystalline formations, mucus, and occasionally blood,\nas stated above.In one instance I observed an appearance resembling\nthree or four crypts of Lieberkuhn united, probably thrown off by\nulceration.If the stools are green, <DW52> masses of various sizes,\nbut mostly small, are also seen under the microscope.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.The pulse is accelerated according to the severity of the attack.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.The\nheat of the surface is at first apt to be increased, though but\nslightly in ordinary cases; but when the vital powers begin to fail\nfrom the continuance of the diarrhoea the warmth of the surface\ndiminishes.In advanced cases approaching a fatal termination the face\nand extremities are pallid and cool, and the pulse gradually becomes\nmore frequent and feeble.The skin is usually dry, and, as already\nstated, the urinary secretion diminished.In severe cases attended by\nfrequent alvine discharges the infant does not pass urine oftener than\nonce or twice daily.The imperfect action of the skin and kidneys is\nnoteworthy.Protracted cases of the summer complaint are apt to be complicated by\ntwo cutaneous eruptions--erythema extending over the perineum and\nfrequently as far as the thighs and lower part of the abdomen, due to\nthe acid and irritating character of the stools; and boils upon the\nforehead and scalp.The latter sometimes extend to the pericranium, and\nin case of recovery leave permanent cicatrices.This furuncular\naffection of the scalp has seemed to me useful in consequence of the\nexternal irritation which it causes, since it occurs at a time when, on\naccount of the feeble heart's action and languid circulation, passive\ncongestion of the vessels of the brain and meninges is liable to be\npresent.Patients who are weak and wasted in consequence of protracted\ndiarrhoea, remaining almost constantly in the recumbent position, often\nhave an occasional dry cough which continues till the close of life.It\nis due to hypostatic congestion in the lungs, usually limited to the\nposterior and {735} inferior portions of the lobes, extending but a\nlittle way into the lungs.It is the result of prolonged recumbency\nwith feeble heart's action and feeble pulmonary circulation.Infants\nreduced by chronic diseases, lying day after day in their cribs with\nlittle movement of their bodies, are very liable to this passive\ncongestion of depending portions of their lungs, toward which the blood\ngravitates, and into which but little air enters in consequence of\ntheir distance and position and the feeble respirations.The hyperaemia\nwhich results is of a passive character, a venous congestion, and the\naffected lobules have a dusky-red color.This congestion, continuing,\nsoon results in pneumonitis of the catarrhal form, subacute and of a\nlow grade, for pulmonary lobules in which the blood remains stagnant\nsoon exhibit augmented cell-proliferation, perhaps from the irritating\neffects of the elements of the blood now withdrawn from the\ncirculation.I have made or procured a considerable number of microscopic\nexaminations in these cases of hypostatic pneumonia, and the\nsolidification of the pulmonary lobules has been found to be due to the\nexaggerated development of the epithelial cells in the alveoli,\ntogether with venous congestion.The affected lobules, whether in the\nstage of hypostatic congestion or the more advanced stage of hypostatic\npneumonitis, when examined at the autopsy, were somewhat softer than in\nhealth, of dark color, and many of the lobules could be inflated by\nstrong force of the breath; but in protracted cases the alveoli in\ncentral parts of the inflamed area resisted insufflation.The lung in\nhypostatic pneumonia, even when it is inflated, still feels firmer\nbetween the fingers than normal lung.Hypostatic pneumonia is so common in hospitals for infants that some\nphysicians whose observations have been chiefly in such institutions\nhave almost ignored other forms of pulmonary inflammation.Billard,\nmany years ago, wrote: \"... The pneumonia of young children is\nevidently the result of stagnation of blood in their lungs.Under these\ncircumstances the blood may be regarded as a kind of foreign body.\"Of\nall the chronic and exhausting diseases of infancy, no one has,\naccording to my observations, been so frequently complicated by\nhypostatic pneumonia as the disease which we are considering, although\nit does not usually give rise to any more prominent symptom than an\noccasional cough.Limited to a small and almost immovable part of the\nlung, it does not ordinarily accelerate respiration or render it\npainful, and the cough is also apparently painless.When progressive loss of flesh and strength has continued several\nweeks, and the patient is much exhausted, another complication is apt\nto occur, known as spurious hydrocephalus or the hydrocephaloid\ndisease, the anatomical characters of which will be described in the\nproper place.The commencement of spurious hydrocephalus is announced\nby gradually increasing drowsiness, perhaps preceded by a period of\nunusual fretfulness.Vomiting and rolling the head are occasional early\nsymptoms of this complication.As the drowsiness increases the pupils\nbecome less sensitive to light than in their normal state, and are\nusually contracted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the milk there.When the drowsiness becomes profound and constant,\nthe pupils remain contracted as in sound sleep or in opium narcotism.The functional activity of the organs is now also diminished, the\nvomiting ceases, the stools become less frequent, the buccal surface\ndry, and the urine more {736} scanty, while the pulse is more frequent\nand feeble.Spurious hydrocephalus either continues till death, or by\nstimulation the patient may emerge from it.Although the summer complaint in its commencement may be promptly\narrested by proper hygienic and medicinal treatment, if it continue a\nfew weeks the anatomical changes which occur are such that recovery, if\nit take place, is necessarily slow and gradual.Improvement is shown by\nbetter digestion, fewer stools and of better appearance, less frequent\nvomiting, a more cheerful countenance, and the absence of symptoms\nwhich indicate a complication.Many recover after days of anxious\nwatching and perhaps after many fluctuations.Death may occur early from a sudden aggravation of symptoms and rapid\nsinking, or the attack may be so violent from the first that the infant\nquickly succumbs; but more frequently death takes place after a\nprolonged sickness.Little by little the patient loses flesh and\nstrength, till a state of marked emaciation is reached.The eyes and\ncheeks are sunken, the bony projections of the face, trunk, and limbs\nbecome prominent, and the skin lies in wrinkles from the wasting.The\naltered expression of the face makes the patient look older than the\nactual age.The joints in contrast with the wasted extremities seem\nenlarged and the fingers and toes elongated.The stools diminish in\nfrequency from diminished peristaltic and vermicular action, and\nvomiting, if previously present, now ceases.A feeble, quick, and\nscarcely appreciable pulse, slow respiration, and diminished inflation\nof the lungs, sightless and contracted pupils, over which the eyelids\nno longer close, announce the near approach of death.The drowsiness\nincreases and the limbs become cool, while perhaps the head is hot.The\ninfant no longer has the ability to nurse, or if bottle-fed the food\nplaced in the mouth flows back or is swallowed with apparent\nindifference.So low is its vitality that it lies pallid and almost\nmotionless for hours or even days before death, and death occurs so\nquietly that the moment of its occurrence is scarcely appreciable.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Since the prominent and essential symptoms of\nthe disease which we are considering pertain to the digestive\napparatus, it is evident that the lesions which attend and characterize\nit are to be found in this part of the system.Lesions elsewhere, so\nfar as they are appreciable to us, are secondary and not essential.I\nhave witnessed a large number of autopsies of infants who have perished\nfrom the summer complaint, chiefly in institutions, and they have been\nsufficiently marked and uniform to enable us to designate it an\nentero-colitis.Several years since I preserved records of the\nautopsical appearances in the intestinal catarrh of infants, most of\nthe cases being of summer diarrhoea.Since then I have each summer witnessed autopsies in the institutions\nin cases of this disease, and the lesions observed were the same as in\nthe eighty-two cases.The question may properly be asked: Can inflammatory hyperaemia of the\nintestinal mucous membrane be distinguished from simple congestion if\nthere be no ulceration and no appreciable thickening of the intestine?It is possible that occasionally I have recorded as inflammatory what\nwas simply a congestive lesion, but I do not think I have incorporated\na {737} sufficient number of such cases to vitiate the statistics.In a\nlarge proportion of the cases there was evident thickening of the\nintestinal mucous membrane or other unequivocal evidence of\ninflammation.The following is an analysis of the eighty-two cases:\n\nThe duodenum and jejunum presented the appearance of inflammatory\nhyperaemia in 12 cases.The hyperaemia was usually in patches of\nvariable extent or of that form described by the term arborescent.In\n51 cases the duodenal and jejunal mucous membrane was pale and without\nany other appearance characteristic of catarrh or inflammation.In the\nremaining 19 cases the appearance of the duodenum and jejunum was not\nrecorded, so that it was probably normal.On the other hand, in the\nileum inflammatory lesions were present as a rule.In 49 cases I found\nthe surface of the ileum distinctly hyperaemic, and in that portion of\nit nearest the ileo-caecal valve, including the valve itself, the\ninflammation had evidently been the most intense, since in this portion\nthe hyperaemia and thickening of the mucous membrane were most marked.In 16 cases the surface of the ileum appeared nearly or quite normal;\nin 14 hyperaemia in the small intestines in patches, streaks, or\narborescence was recorded, but the records do not state in which\ndivision of the intestines they were observed.Billard, with other observers, has noticed the frequency and intensity\nof the inflammatory lesions in entero-colitis in the terminal portion\nof the small intestines, and the thickening in many cases of the\nileo-caecal valve, and he asks whether the vomiting which is so common\nand often obstinate in this disease may not be sometimes due to\nobstruction to the passage of fecal matter at the valve in consequence\nof the hyperaemia and swelling, but has not observed any retained fecal\nmatter above it, such as we find in any part of the colon, or any other\nappearance which indicated sufficient obstruction to cause symptoms.Still, it seems not improbable that the reason why the inflammatory\nlesions are more pronounced at and immediately above the valve than in\nother parts of the small intestine is that the fecal matter, so\ncommonly acid and irritating in this disease, is somewhat delayed in\nits passage downward at this point.Small superficial circular or oval ulcers were observed in the ileum in\n4 cases, in 2 of which they were found also in the lower part of the\njejunum.In 1 case the records state that ulcers were in the jejunum,\nbut do not mention whether they were also in the ileum.In 1 case, in\nwhich there was much thickening of the ileum next to the ileo-caecal\nvalve, many small granulations had sprouted up from the submucous\nconnective tissue, so that the mucous surface appeared as if studded\nwith small warts.Softening of the mucous membrane was also apparent in certain cases.The firmness of its attachment to the parts underneath varied\nconsiderably in different specimens.I was able in cases in which there\nwas considerable softening to detach readily the mucous membrane with\nthe nail or handle of the scalpel within so short a period after death\nthat it was probable that the change of consistence was not cadaveric.In some cases the vessels of the submucous tissue were injected and\nthis tissue infiltrated.In all the cases except one lesions were present indicating\ninflammation {738} of the mucous membrane of the colon.In 39\nhyperaemia, thickening, and other signs of inflammation extended over\nnearly or quite the entire colon; in 14 the colitis was confined to the\ndescending portion entirely or almost entirely; in 28 cases the records\nstate that inflammatory lesions were found in the colon, but their\nexact location is not mentioned.In 18 of the autopsies the mucous\nmembrane of the colon was found ulcerated.Therefore, according to these statistics--and autopsies which I have\nwitnessed that are not embraced in them disclosed similar\nlesions--colitis is present, almost without exception, in cases of\nsummer diarrhoea, associated with more or less ileitis.The portion of\nthe colon which presents the most marked inflammatory lesions is that\nin and immediately above the sigmoid flexure--that portion, therefore,\nin which any fermenting fecal matter has reached its greatest degree of\nfermentation, and consequently contains the most irritating elements,\nand where, next to the caput coli, it is longest delayed in its passage\ndownward.The solitary glands of both the large and small intestines and Peyer's\npatches undergo hyperplasia.In cases of short duration, and in parts\nof the intestine where the inflammatory action has been mild, the\nsolitary glands present a vascular appearance, like the surrounding\nmembrane, and are slightly enlarged.The enlargement is most apparent\nif the intestine be viewed by transmitted light, when not only are the\nglands seen to be swollen, but their central dark points are distinct.If a higher grade of intestinal catarrh or a catarrh more protracted\nhave occurred, the volume of these follicles is so increased that they\nrise above the common level and present a papillary appearance.Peyer's\npatches are also distinct and punctate.The enlargement of Peyer's\npatches, like that of the solitary glands, is due to hyperplasia, the\nelementary cells being largely increased in number.The small ulcers which, as we have seen from the above statistics, are\npresent in a certain proportion of cases in the mucous membrane of the\ncolon, and more rarely in that of the small intestine when the\ninflammation has been protracted and of a severe type, appear to occur\nin the solitary glands and in the mucous membrane surrounding them.While some of these glands in a specimen are simply tumefied, others\nare slightly ulcerated, and others still nearly or quite destroyed.The\nulcers are usually from one to three lines in diameter, circular or\noval, with edges slightly raised from infiltration.Rarely, I have seen\nminute coagula of blood in one or more ulcers, and I have also observed\nulcers which have evidently been larger and have partially healed.The\nulcers are more frequently found in the descending colon than in other\nportions of the intestines.When ulcers are present they commonly occur\nin the descending colon, or if occurring elsewhere they are most\nabundant in this situation.According to my observations, these ulcers are found chiefly in infants\nover the age of six months--during the time, therefore, when there is\ngreatest functional activity and most rapid development of the solitary\nglands.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.Peyer's patches, though frequently prominent and distinct, have\nnot been ulcerated in any of the cases observed by me.The appendix vermiformis participates in the catarrh when it occurs in\nthe caput coli, its mucous membrane being hyperaemic and thickened.In\n{739} certain rare cases the inflammation is so intense that a thin\nfilm of fibrin is exuded in places upon the surface of the colon.It is\napt to be overlooked or to be washed away in the examination.The\nrectum usually presents no inflammatory lesions, or but slight lesions\nin comparison with those in the colon.It usually remains of the normal\npale color, or but slightly vascular even when there is almost general\ncolitis.Hence the infrequency of tenesmus.As might be expected from the nature of the disease, the secretion of\nmucus from the intestinal surface is augmented.It is often seen\nforming a layer upon the intestinal surface, and it appears in the\nstools mixed with epithelial cells and sometimes with blood and pus.The mesenteric glands in cases which have run the most protracted\ncourse and end fatally are found more or less enlarged from\nhyperplasia.They are frequently as large as a pea or larger, and of a\nlight color, the color being due not only to the hyperplasia, but in\npart to the anaemia.Occasionally, when patients have been much reduced\nfrom the long continuance of the diarrhoea, and are in a state of\nmarked cachexia at death, we find certain of these glands caseous.The condition of the stomach is interesting, since indigestion and\nvomiting are so commonly present.I have records of its appearance in\n59 cases, in 42 of which it seemed normal, having the usual pale color\nand exhibiting only such changes as occur in the cadaver.In the\nremaining 17 cases the stomach was more or less hyperaemic, and in 3 of\nthem points of ulceration were observed in the mucous membrane.All physicians familiar with this disease have remarked the frequency\nof stomatitis.In protracted and grave cases it is a common\ncomplication.The buccal surface in these cases is more vascular than\nnatural, and if the vital powers are much reduced superficial\nulcerations are not infrequent, oftener upon the gums than elsewhere.The gums are apt to be spongy, more or less swollen, bleeding readily\nwhen rubbed or pressed upon.Thrush is a common complication of the\nsummer complaint in infants under the age of three or four months, but\nis infrequent in older infants.Occurring in those over the age of six\nor eight months, it has an unfavorable prognostic significance,\nindicating a form of summer diarrhoea which commonly eventuates in\ndeath.The belief has long been prevalent in the past that the liver is also\nin fault.The green color of the stools was supposed to be due to\nvitiated bile.But usually in the post-mortem examinations which I have\nmade I have found that the green coloration of the fecal matter did not\nappear at the point where the bile enters the intestines, but at some\npoint below the ductus communis choledochus in the jejunum or ileum.The green tinge, at first slight, becomes more and more distinct on\ntracing it downward in the intestine.It appears to be due to admixture\nof the intestinal secretions with the fecal matter.I have notes of the appearance and state of the liver in 32 fatal\ncases.Nothing could be seen in these examinations which indicated any\nanatomical change in this organ that could be attributed to the\ndiarrhoeal malady.The size and weight of the liver varied considerably\nin infants of the same age, but probably there was no greater\ndifference than usually obtains among glandular organs in a state of\nhealth.The following was the weight of this organ in 20 cases: {740}\n\n    Age.| 10 months   6-3/4 ounces.2 months  3-1/2   \"      | 13   \"      6       \"\n  2   \"     3-1/2   \"      | 14   \"      9       \"\n  4   \"     5       \"      | 15   \"      6       \"\n  5   \"     6-1/2   \"      | 15   \"      7-1/2   \"\n  5   \"     9       \"      | 15   \"      9-1/2   \"\n  7   \"     4-1/2   \"      | 16   \"      6       \"\n  7   \"     6       \"      | 19   \"      4-1/2   \"\n  7   \"     6-1/4   \"      | 20   \"      9-1/4   \"\n  9   \"     8       \"      | 23   \"     15       \"\n\nIn none of these cases did the size, weight, or appearance of this\norgan seem to be different from that in health or in other diseases,\nexcept in one in which fatty degeneration had occurred, but this was\nprobably due to tuberculosis, which was also present.In most of these\ncases the liver was examined microscopically, and the only noteworthy\nappearance observed was the variable amount of oil-globules in the\nhepatic cells.In some specimens the oil-globules were in excess, in\nothers deficient, and in others still they were more abundant in one\npart of the organ than in another.Little importance was attached to\nthese differences in the quantity of oily matter.Hypostatic congestion of the posterior portions of the lungs, ending if\nit continue in a form of subacute catarrhal pneumonia and giving rise\nto an occasional painless cough, has been described in the preceding\npages.The character of the cough in connection with the wasting might\nexcite suspicions of the presence of tubercles in the lungs; but\ntubercles are rare in this disease, and when present I should suspect a\nstrong hereditary predisposition.They occurred in only 1 of the 82\ncases.The state of the encephalon in those patients in whom spurious\nhydrocephalus occurs is interesting.In protracted cases of the\ndiarrhoea the brain wastes like the body and limbs.In the young\ninfant, in whom the cranial bones are still ununited, the occipital and\nsometimes the frontal bones become depressed and overlapped by the\nparietal, the depression being of course proportionate to the\ndiminution in size of the encephalon.In older children, with the cranial bones consolidated, serous effusion\noccurs according to the degree of waste, thus preserving the size of\nthe encephalon.The effusion is chiefly external to the brain, lying\nover the convolutions from the base to the vertex.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.Its quantity varies\nfrom one or two drachms to an ounce or more.Along with this serous\neffusion, and antedating it, passive congestion of the cerebral veins\nand sinuses is also present.This congestion is the obvious and\nnecessary result of the feebleness of the heart's action and the loss\nof brain substance.DIAGNOSIS.--The occurrence and continuance of diarrhoea in the warm\nmonths, without any apparent cause except the agencies which hot\nweather produces, indicate this disease.The exciting cause of the\nattack may be the use of some indigestible and irritating substance,\ndietetic or medicinal, as fruits with their seeds or a purgative\nmedicine; but if it continue after the immediate effects of the agent\nhave passed off, it is proper to attribute the diarrhoea to the summer\nseason.In the adult abdominal tenderness is an important diagnostic symptom of\nintestinal catarrh, but in the infant this symptom is lacking or is not\nin general appreciable, so that it does not aid in diagnosis.When the\n{741} diagnosis of the disease is established, the symptoms do not\nusually indicate what part of the intestinal surface is chiefly\ninvolved, but it may be assumed that it is the lower part of the ileum\nand the colon.The presence of mucus or of mucus tinged with blood in\nthe stools shows the predominance of colitis.PROGNOSIS.--Although this disease every summer largely increases the\ndeath-rate of young children, most cases can be cured if the proper\nhygienic and medicinal measures be early applied.It is obvious, from\nwhat has been stated in the foregoing pages, that cholera infantum is\nthe form of this malady which involves greatest danger.Except in such\ncases there is sufficient forewarning of a fatal result, for if death\noccur it is after a lingering sickness, with fluctuations and gradual\nloss of flesh and strength.Patients often recover from a state of\ngreat prostration and emaciation, provided that no fatal complications\narise.The eyes may be sunken, the skin lie in folds from the wasting,\nthe strength may be so exhausted that any other than the recumbent\nposition is impossible, and yet the patient may recover by removal to\nthe country, by change of weather, or by the use of better diet and\nremedies.Therefore an absolutely unfavorable prognosis should not be\nmade except in cases that are complicated or that border on collapse.The most dangerous symptoms, except those which indicate commencing or\nactual collapse, arise from the state of the brain.Rolling the head,\nsquinting, feeble action or permanent contraction of the pupils,\nspasmodic or irregular movements of the limbs, indicate the near\napproach of death, as do also coldness of face and extremities and\ninability to swallow.It is obvious also that in making the prognosis\nin ordinary cases we should consider the age of the patient, the state\nof the weather, the time in the summer, whether in the beginning or\nnear its close, and the surroundings, especially in reference to the\nimpurity of the air, as well as the patient's condition.Cholera Infantum, or Choleriform Diarrhoea.This is the most severe form of the summer complaint.It receives the\nname which designates it from the violence of its symptoms, which\nclosely resemble those of Asiatic cholera.It is, however, quite\ndistinct from that disease.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.It is characterized by frequent stools,\nvomiting, great elevation of temperature, and rapid and great\nemaciation and loss of strength.It commonly occurs under the age of\ntwo years.It sometimes begins abruptly, the previous health having\nbeen good; in other cases it is preceded by the ordinary form of summer\ndiarrhoea.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.The stools have been thinner than natural and somewhat more\nfrequent, but not such as to excite alarm, when suddenly they become\nmore frequent and watery, and the parents are surprised and frightened\nby the rapid sinking and real danger of the infant.The first evacuations, unless there have been previous diarrhoea, may\ncontain fecal matter, but subsequently they are so thin that they soak\ninto the diaper like urine, and in some cases they scarcely produce\nmore of a stain than does this secretion.Their odor is peculiar--not\nfecal, but musty and offensive, and occasionally almost odorless.Commencing simultaneously with the watery evacuations or soon after is\nanother {742} symptom, irritability of the stomach, which increases\ngreatly the prostration and danger.Whatever drinks are swallowed by\nthe infant are rejected immediately or after a few moments, or retching\nmay occur without vomiting.The appetite is lost and the thirst is\nintense.Cold water is taken with avidity, and if the infant nurse it\neagerly seizes the breast in order to relieve the thirst.The tongue is\nmoist at first, and clean or covered with a light fur, pulse\naccelerated, respiration either natural or somewhat increased in\nfrequency, and the surface warm, but the temperature is speedily\nreduced in severe cases.The internal temperature or that of the blood\nis always very high.In ordinary cases of cholera infantum the\nthermometer introduced into the rectum rises to or above 105 degrees,\nand I have seen it indicate 107 degrees.Although the infant may be\nrestless at first, it does not appear to have any abdominal pain or\ntenderness.The restlessness is apparently due to thirst or to that\nunpleasant sensation which the sick feel when the vital powers are\nrapidly reduced.The urine is scanty in proportion to the gravity of", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "The emaciation and loss of strength are more rapid than in any other\ndisease which I can recall to mind, unless in Asiatic cholera.In a few\nhours the parents scarcely recognize in the changed and melancholy\naspect of the infant any resemblance to the features which it exhibited\na day or two before.The eyes are sunken, the eyelids and lips are\npermanently open from the feeble contractile power of the muscles which\nclose them, while the loss of the fluids from the tissues and the\nemaciation are such that the bony angles become more prominent and the\nskin in places lies in folds.As the disease approaches a fatal termination, which often occurs in\ntwo or three days, the infant remains quiet, not disturbed even by the\nflies which alight upon its face.The limbs and face become cool, the\neyes bleared, pupils contracted, and the urine scanty or suppressed.In\nsome instances, when the patient is near death, the respiration becomes\naccelerated, either from the effect of the disease upon the respiratory\ncentres or from pulmonary congestion resulting from the feeble\ncirculation.As the vital powers fail the pulse becomes progressively\nmore feeble, the surface has a clammy coldness, the contracted pupils\nno longer respond to light, and the stupor deepens, from which it is\nimpossible to arouse the infant.In the most favorable cases cholera infantum is checked before the\noccurrence of these grave symptoms, and often in cases which are\nultimately fatal there is not such a speedy termination of the malady\nas is indicated in the above description.The choleriform diarrhoea\nabates and the case becomes one of ordinary summer complaint.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Rilliet and Barthez, who of foreign writers\ntreat of cholera infantum at greatest length, describe it under the\nname of gastro-intestinal choleriform catarrh.\"The perusal,\" they\nremark, \"of anatomico-pathological descriptions, and especially the\nstudy of the facts, show that the gastro-intestinal tube in subjects\nwho succumb to this disease may be in four different states: (_a_)\neither the stomach is softened without any lesion of the digestive\ntube; (_b_) or the stomach is softened at the same time that the mucous\nmembrane of the intestine, and especially its follicular apparatus, is\ndiseased; (_c_) or the stomach is healthy, {743} while the follicular\napparatus or the mucous membrane is diseased; (_d_) or, finally, the\ngastro-intestinal tube is not the seat of any lesion appreciable to our\nsenses in the present state of our knowledge, or it presents lesions so\ninsignificant that they are not sufficient to explain the gravity of\nthe symptoms.\"So far, the disease resembles all the catarrhs, but what is special is\nthe abundance of serous secretion and the disturbance of the great\nsympathetic nerve.\"The serous secretion, which appears to be produced by a perspiration\n(analogous to that of the respiratory passages and of the skin) rather\nthan by a follicular secretion, shows, perhaps, that the elimination of\nsubstances is effected by other organs than the follicles; perhaps,\nalso, we ought to see a proof that the materials to eliminate are not\nthe same as in simple catarrh.Upon all these points we are constrained\nto remain in doubt.We content ourselves with pointing out the\nfact.\"[2]\n\n[Footnote 2: _Maladies des Enfants_.]On the 1st of August, 1861, I made the autopsy of an infant sixteen\nmonths old who died of cholera infantum with a sickness of less than\none day.Nothing\nunusual was observed in the brain, unless perhaps a little more than\nthe ordinary injection of vessels at the vertex.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.No marked anatomical\nchange was observed in the stomach and intestines, except enlargement\nof the patches of Peyer as well as of the solitary and mesenteric\nglands.In this and the following cases there was\napparently slight softening of the intestinal mucous membrane, but\nwhether it was pathological or cadaveric was uncertain, as the weather\nwas very warm.Examined by the microscope, it\nwas found to contain about the normal number of oil-globules.The second case was that of an infant seven months old, wet-nursed, who\ndied July 26, 1862, after a sickness also of about one day.He was\npreviously emaciated, but without any marked ailment.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.The post-mortem\nexamination was made on the 28th.The brain was somewhat softer than\nnatural, but otherwise healthy.There was no abnormal vascularity of\nthe membranes of the brain, and no serous effusion within the cranium.The mucous membrane of the intestines had nearly the normal color\nthroughout, but it seemed somewhat thickened and softened; the solitary\nglands of the colon were prominent.The patches of Peyer were not\ndistinct.In the New York Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum an infant twenty\nmonths old, previously healthy, was seized with cholera infantum on the\n25th of June, 1864.The alvine evacuations, as is usual with this\ndisease, were frequent and watery, and attended by obstinate vomiting.Death occurred in slight spasms in thirty-six hours.The exciting cause\nwas probably the use of a few currants which were eaten in a cake the\nday before, some of which fruit was contained in the first evacuations.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.The only pathological changes which were\nobserved in the stomach and intestines were slightly vascular patches\nin the small intestines and an unusual prominence of the solitary\nglands in the colon.The glands resembled small beads imbedded in the\nmucous membrane.The lungs in the above cases were healthy, excepting\nhypostatic congestion.{744} Since the date of these autopsies I have made others in cases\nwhich terminated fatally after a brief duration, and have uniformly\nfound similar lesions--namely, the gastro-intestinal surface either\nwithout vascularity or scantily vascular in streaks or patches,\nsometimes presenting a whitish or soggy appearance and somewhat\nsoftened, while the solitary glands were enlarged so as to be prominent\nupon the surface.In cases which continue longer evident inflammatory\nlesions soon appear which are identical with those which have already\nbeen described in our remarks on the ordinary form of the summer\ndiarrhoea.During my term of service in the New York Foundling Asylum in the\nsummer of 1884, an infant died after a brief illness with all the\nsymptoms of cholera infantum, and the intestines were sent to William\nH. Welch, now of Johns Hopkins Hospital, for microscopic examination.His report was as follows: \"I found undoubted evidence of acute\ninflammation.There was an increased number of small, round cells\n(leucocytes) in the mucous and submucous coats.This accumulation of\nnew cells was most abundant in and around the solitary follicles, which\nwere greatly swollen.Clumps of lymphoid cells were found extending\neven a little into the muscular coat.The epithelial lining of the\nintestine was not demonstrable, but this is usually the case with\npost-mortem specimens of human intestine, and justifies no inferences\nas to pathological changes.The glands of Lieberkuhn were rich in the\nso-called goblet-cells, and some of the glands were distended with\nmucus and desquamated epithelium, so as to present sometimes the\nappearance of little cysts.This was observed especially in the\nneighborhood of the solitary follicles.The blood-vessels, especially\nthe veins of the submucous coat, were abnormally distended with blood.I searched for micro-organisms, and found them in abundance upon the\nfree surface of the intestine in the mucous accumulations there, and\nalso in the mouths of the glands of Lieberkuhn.Both rod-shaped and\nsmall round bacteria were found.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.I attach no especial importance to\nfinding bacteria upon the surface of the intestine.The general result\nof the examination is to confirm the view that cholera infantum is\ncharacterized by an acute intestinal inflammation.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.NATURE.--Cholera infantum appears from its symptoms and lesions to be\nthe most severe form of intestinal catarrh to which infants are liable.The alvine discharges, to which the rapid prostration is largely due,\nprobably consist in part of intestinal secretions and in part of serum\nwhich has transuded from the capillaries of the intestines.That the\nintestinal mucous membrane sometimes presents a pale appearance at the\nautopsy of an infant who, previously well, has died of cholera infantum\nafter a sickness of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, is perhaps due to\nthe great amount of liquid secretion and transudation in which the\ninflamed surface is bathed.Moreover, it is, I believe, a recognized\nfact that the hyperaemia of an acutely-inflamed surface when of short\nduration frequently disappears in the cadaver, as that of scarlet fever\nand erysipelas.The early hyperplasia of the solitary and mesenteric\nglands, and the hyperaemia and thickening of the surface of the ileum\nand colon in those who have survived a few days, indicate the\ninflammatory character of the malady.The opinion has been expressed by certain observers that cholera {745}\ninfantum is identical with thermic fever or sunstroke.There is indeed\na resemblance to thermic fever as regards certain important symptoms.In cholera infantum the temperature is from 105 degrees to 108 degrees;\nin sunstroke it is also very high, often running above 108 degrees.Great heat of head, contracted pupils, thin fecal evacuations,\nembarrassed respiration, scanty urine, and cerebral symptoms are common\ntoward the close of cholera infantum, and they are the prominent\nsymptoms in sunstroke.Nevertheless, I cannot accept the theory which\nregards these maladies as identical, and which removes cholera infantum\nfrom the list of intestinal diseases.In cholera infantum the\ngastro-intestinal symptoms always take the precedence, and are, except\nin advanced cases, always more prominent than other symptoms.It does\nnot commence as by a stroke like coup de soleil, but it comes on more\ngradually, though rapidly, and it often supervenes upon a diarrhoea or\nsome error of diet.In the commencement of cholera infantum the infant\nis not apt to be drowsy, and it is often wide awake and restless from\nthe thirst.Contrast this with the alarming stupor of sunstroke.Sunstroke only occurs during the hours of excessive heat, but cholera\ninfantum may occur at any hour or in any day during the hot weather,\nprovided that there be sufficient dietetic cause.Again, intestinal\ninflammation is not common in sunstroke, while it is the common or, as\nI believe, the essential lesion of cholera infantum.These facts show,\nin my opinion, that the two maladies are essentially and entirely\ndistinct.Nevertheless, cases of apparent sunstroke sometimes occur in\nthe infant, and if the bowels are at the same time relaxed the disease\nis apt to be regarded as cholera infantum, and if fatal is usually\nreported as such to the health authorities.Cases of this kind I have\noccasionally observed or they have been reported to me, although they\nare not common.With the exception of the organs of digestion no uniform lesions are\nobserved in any of the viscera in cholera infantum, except such as are\ndue to change in the quantity and fluidity of the blood and its\ncirculation.Writers describe an anaemic appearance of the thoracic and\nabdominal viscera, and occasionally passive congestion of the cerebral\nvessels.The cerebral symptoms often present toward the close of life\nin unfavorable cases of cholera infantum are often due to spurious\nhydrocephalus, which we have described above; but as the urinary\nsecretion is scanty or suppressed, cerebral symptoms may in certain\ncases be due to uraemia.DIAGNOSIS.--This form of the summer diarrhoea is diagnosticated by the\nsymptoms, and especially by the frequency and character of the stools.The stools have already been described as frequent, often passed with\nconsiderable force, deficient in fecal matter, and thin, so as to soak\ninto the diaper almost like urine.The vomiting, thirst, rapid sinking,\nand emaciation serve to distinguish cholera infantum from other\ndiarrhoeal maladies.When Asiatic cholera is prevalent the differential diagnosis between\nthe two is difficult if not impossible.PROGNOSIS.--Cholera infantum is one of those diseases in regard to\nwhich physicians often injure their reputation by not giving sufficient\nnotice of the danger, or even by expressing a favorable opinion when\nthe case soon after ends fatally.A favorable prognosis should seldom\nbe expressed without qualification.If the urgent symptoms be relieved,\n{746} still the disease may continue as an ordinary intestinal\ninflammation, which in hot weather is formidable and often fatal.If\nthe stools become more consistent and less frequent without the\noccurrence of cerebral symptoms, while the limbs are warm and the pulse\ngood, we may confidently express the opinion that there is no present\ndanger.The duration of true cholera infantum is short.It either ends fatally,\nor it begins soon to abate and ceases, or it continues, and is not to\nbe distinguished in its subsequent course from an attack of summer\ndiarrhoea beginning in the ordinary manner.TREATMENT.--Preventive Measures.--Obviously, efficient preventive\nmeasures consist in the removal of infants so far as practicable from\nthe operation of the causes which produce the disease.Weaning just\nbefore or in the hot weather should, if possible, be avoided, and\nremoval to the country should be recommended, especially for those who\nare deprived of the breast-milk during the age when such nutriment is\nrequired.If for any reason it is necessary to employ artificial\nfeeding for infants under the age of ten months, that food should\nobviously be used which most closely resembles human milk in\ndigestibility and in nutritive properties.Care should be taken to\nprevent fermentation in the food before its use, since much harm is\ndone by the employment of milk or other food in which fermentative\nchanges have occurred and which occur quickly in dietetic mixtures in\nthe hot months.It is also very important that the infant receive its food in proper\nquantity and at proper intervals, for if the mother or nurse in her\nanxiety to have it thrive feed it too often or in too large quantity,\nthe surplus food which it cannot digest if not vomited undergoes\nfermentation, and consequently becomes irritating to the\ngastro-intestinal surface.The physician should be able to give advice\nnot only in reference to the frequency of feeding, but also in regard\nto the quantity of food which the infant requires at each feeding.Correct knowledge and advice in this matter aid in the prevention and\ncure of the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Chadbourne of this city and myself made some observations in order to\nascertain how much food well-nourished infants receive daily.We\nselected infants that had an abundance of breast-milk, and weighed them\nbefore and after each nursing, so as to determine how much each infant\ntook during twenty-four hours.The avoirdupois ounce contains 437.5\ngrains, and we ascertained by careful weight and measurement, employing\nthe metric system for its greater accuracy, that one fluidounce of\nhuman milk, with a specific gravity of 1.031, weighed 451.9 grains.With these data it was easy to determine the quantity of milk in\nfluidounces from its weight.Our first observations related to 12\ninfants under the age of five weeks, 8 of which nursed twelve times,\nand the remaining 4 eight, nine, nine, and eleven times respectively,\nin the twenty-four hours.The quantity of milk received by them in\ntwenty-four hours varied considerably in the different cases, but the\naverage was 12.41 fluidounces.Therefore if a baby in the first five\nweeks nurse every two hours, it receives only a little more than one\nfluidounce at each nursing.The next observations were made upon 15 infants between the ages of\nfive weeks and ten months: 8 of the 15 were under the age of six {747}\nmonths, and the remaining 7 were between the ages of six months and ten\nmonths.The weighing showed that the younger took nearly the same\nquantity per day, on the average, as the older infants in this group.The average quantity received by each was twenty-four and six-tenths\nfluidounces.Hence if the nursings were eight in the twenty-four hours,\nthree ounces were taken at each nursing; if the nursings were twelve,\nthe quantity each time was two ounces.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Biedert of Germany has also made similar observations in order to\ndetermine the amount of nutriment required by infants.The results of\nhis weight-studies, as he designates them, were published in the\n_Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde_, xix.B., 3 H. His weighing showed that\ninfants during their first month, if fed on cow's milk, required from\n160 to 200 grammes of milk daily, and in the third month 300 grammes.These quantities in fluid measure are 5.44 to 6.83 ounces, the quantity\nrequired each day in the first month, and 10.22 ounces, the quantity\nrequired daily the second month.Therefore, both my weights and\nBiedert's show that infants under the age of two months assimilate a\nsmaller quantity of milk than is usually supposed.For infants older\nthan two months he estimates the quantity of milk required by infants\nby their weight.He believes that the greater the weight the greater is\nthe amount of food which the infant needs.The method pursued by\nChadbourne and myself is more simple, and it seems to indicate with\nsufficient exactness the amount of food required.The Second New York Cavalry shared largely in the glories\nand miseries of this great and successful raid.At Five Forks, Deep Creek,\nand Sailors Creek, it not only maintained its gallant and meritorious\nrecord, but added to its great renown.At the gentle and joyous passage\nof arms at Appomattox Station, on the 8th of April, it reached the climax\nof its glory, and, by its deeds of daring, touched the pinnacle of fame.On that day it performed prodigies of valor, and achieved successes as\npregnant with good results as any single action of the war.By forcing a\npassage through the rebel lines and heading off Lee's army, it contributed\nlargely to the result that followed the next day--the surrender of the\nConfederate Army of Northern Virginia.*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the night of the 7th of April we camped on Buffalo River.Moving at an\nearly hour on the 8th, we crossed the Lynchburg Railroad at Prospect\nStation, and headed for Appomattox Station, where it was expected we would\nstrike, if not intercept, Lee's retreating, disintegrating army.The trail\nwas fresh and the chase hot.Joy beamed in every eye, for all felt that\nthe end was drawing near, and we earnestly hoped that ours might be the\nglorious opportunity of striking the final blow.About noon the regiment\nwas detached to capture a force of the enemy said to be at one of the\ncrossings of the Appomattox.Some few hundreds, unarmed, half-starved,\nstragglers, with no fight in them, were found, and turned over to the\nProvost Marshall.Resuming its place in the column, I received orders to\nreport with the regiment to General Custer, who was at its head.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the football.Reporting\nin compliance with this order, General Custer informed me that his scouts\nhad reported three large trains of cars at Appomattox Station, loaded with\nsupplies for the rebel army; that he expected to have made a junction\nwith Merritt's division near this point; that his orders were to wait here\ntill Merritt joined him; that he had not heard from him since morning, and\nhad sent an officer to communicate with him, but if he did not hear from\nhim in half an hour, he wished me to take my regiment and capture the\ntrains of cars, and, if possible, reach and hold the pike to Lynchburg.While talking, the whistle of the locomotive was distinctly but faintly\nheard, and the column was at once moved forward, the Second New York in\nadvance.As we neared the station the whistles became more and more\ndistinct, and a scout reported the trains rapidly unloading, and that the\nadvance of the rebel army was passing through Appomattox Court House.Although Custer's orders were to make a junction with Merritt before\ncoming in contact with the enemy, here was a chance to strike a decisive\nblow, which, if successful, would add to his renown and glory, and if not,\nMerritt would soon be up to help him out of the scrape.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Our excitement was\nintense, but subdued.All saw the vital importance of heading off the\nenemy.Another whistle, nearer and clearer, and another scout decided the\nquestion.I was ordered to move rapidly to Appomattox Station, seize the\ntrains there, and, if possible, get possession of the Lynchburg pike.General Custer rode up alongside of me and, laying his hand on my\nshoulder, said, \"Go in, old fellow, don't let anything stop you; now is\nthe chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.The regiment\nleft the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we\ncaught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a\ncheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three\ntrains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and\nfiremen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men\naround me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered\nthe trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were\nclaimed as captures by General Ord's corps.The cars were loaded with\ncommissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the\nrebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly\ndown on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a\nfierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did\nbut little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by\na dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel\nPennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily\nskirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily\nconstructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which\nimmense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was\nordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's\nlines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest\nof the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then\nCuster, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and\ncharge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without\norganization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and\neverywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize\nwas so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel\ninfantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and\ndestruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so\nas soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,\nonly to recoil in confusion and loss.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the football there.Confident that this mode of fighting\nwould not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the\noffensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I\nwent to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would\nlet me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He\nexcitedly replied, \"Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything\nyou can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold\nof the pike to-night.\"Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by\nme, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other\nregiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge\ndown a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery\nwas posted.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the football.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright\nlights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot\nswept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The\nline was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,\nnow pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither\nprisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and\nartillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and\nheaded for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we\ndiscovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit\nwas checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his\nroute to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that\nour cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our\nmen dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant\nColonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a\npicket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other\ndivisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late\nto take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took\nhours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the\nrailroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground\nto rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our\nassistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line\nwould be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work\nto head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud\nhurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming\nin rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving\ntowards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing\nlively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry\ncorps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the\nposition of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who\ngreeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to \"run the gauntlet\" of fire from the enemy's\nguns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest\nof the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy\nto put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at\nlast Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving\nat almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of\na surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste\nfor the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a\nparty of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly\nreplied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a\ncharge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the\ncharge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we\nhalted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we\ncharged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front\nwas a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,\nwith batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have\ncharged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost\ntotal annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that\npreliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon\nall became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward\nbetween the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends\namong the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee\n(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus\nWilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the\nground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I\ncalled to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a\nhostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General\nLee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General\nBabcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our\nlines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he\ngracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,\nwhich was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with\ncheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and\nthe rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our\nmen, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations\nwith the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that\nthe rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels\nseemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,\ndissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands\neager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to\neat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with\nColonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender\nhad taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that\neverything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in\nwhose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at\nManassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his\nname in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden\nharvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories\nof these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record\nof great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their\nheads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the\ncongratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They\nfelt they had done their duty, and given the \"tottering giant\" a blow that\nlaid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.The path from gate to window was shaped like\nthe letter S, and was for the most part defined by tall shrubs on\neither side, of a height varying from six to nine feet.Through this\npath the villains had made their way to the window; through this path\nthe murderer, leaving his comrade dead, had made his escape.Their\noperations, for their own safety's sake, must undoubtedly have been\nconducted while the night was still dark.Reasonable also to conclude\nthat, being strangers in the village (although by some means they must\nhave known beforehand that Doctor Louis's house was worth the\nplundering), they could not have been acquainted with the devious\nturns in the path from the gate to the window.Therefore they must\nhave felt their way through, touching the shrubs with their hands,\nmost likely breaking some of the slender stalks, until they arrived at\nthe open space at the back of the building.These reflections impelled me to make a careful inspection of the\nshrubs, and I was very soon startled by a discovery.Here and there\nsome stalks were broken and torn away, and here and there were\nindisputable evidences that the shrubs had been grasped by human\nhands.It was not this that startled me, for it was in accordance with\nmy own train of reasoning, but it was that there were stains of blood\non the broken stalks, especially upon those which had been roughly\ntorn from the parent tree.I seemed to see a man, with blood about\nhim, staggering blindly through the path, snatching at the shrubs both\nfor support and guidance, and the loose stalks falling from his hands\nas he went.Two men entered the grounds, only one left--that one, the\nmurderer.Between\nthe victim and the perpetrator of the deed?In that case, what became\nof the theory of action I had so elaborately described to the landlord\nof the Three Black Crows?I had imagined an instantaneous impulse of\ncrime and its instantaneous execution.I had imagined a death as\nsudden as it was violent, a deed from which the murderer had escaped\nwithout the least injury to himself; and here, on both sides of me,\nwere the clearest proofs that the man who had fled must have been\ngrievously wounded.My ingenuity was at fault in the endeavour to\nbring these signs into harmony with the course of events I had\ninvented in my interview with the landlord.I went straight to the office of the magistrate, a small building of\nfour rooms on the ground floor, the two in front being used as the\nmagistrate's private room and court, the two in the rear as cells, not\nat all uncomfortable, for aggressors of the law.It was but rarely\nthat they were occupied.At the door of the court I encountered Father\nDaniel.During his lifetime no such\ncrime had been perpetrated in the village, and his only comfort was\nthat the actors in it were strangers.But that did not lessen his\nhorror of the deed, and", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "he said, in a voice broken by tears.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Thrust before the Eternal Presence weighed down by sin!I\nhave been praying by his side for mercy, and for mercy upon his\nmurderer.I could not sympathise with his sentiments, and I told him so sternly.He made no attempt to convert me to his views, but simply said, \"All\nmen should pray that they may never be tempted.\"And so he left me, and turned in the direction of his little chapel to\noffer up prayers for the dead and the living sinners.Doctor Louis was with the magistrate; they had been discussing\ntheories, and had heard from the landlord of the Three Black Crows my\nown ideas of the movements of the strangers on the previous night.\"In certain respects you may be right in your speculations,\" the\nmagistrate said; \"but on one important point you are in error.\"\"I have already discovered,\" I said, \"that my theory is wrong, and not\nin accordance with fact; but we will speak of that presently.\"As to the weapon with which the murder was done,\" replied the\nmagistrate, a shrewd man, whose judicial perceptions fitted him for a\nlarger sphere of duties than he was called upon to perform in Nerac.\"A club of some sort,\" said the magistrate, \"with which the dead man\nwas suddenly attacked from behind.\"\"No, but a search is being made for it and also for the murderer.\"There is no shadow of doubt that the\nmissing man is guilty.\"\"And yet,\" urged Doctor Louis, in a gentle tone, \"to condemn a man\nunheard is repugnant to justice.\"\"There are circumstances,\" said the magistrate, \"which point so surely\nto guilt that it would be inimical to justice to dispute them.By the\nway,\" he continued, addressing me, \"did not the landlord of the Three\nBlack Crows mention something to the effect that you were at his inn\nlast night after you left Dr.Louis's house, and that you and he had a\nconversation respecting the strangers, who were at that time in the\nsame room as yourselves?\"\"If he did,\" I said, \"he stated what is correct.I was there, and saw\nthe strangers, of whom the landlord entertained suspicions which have\nbeen proved to be well founded.\"\"Then you will be able to identify the body, already,\" added the\nmagistrate, \"identified by the landlord.\"I shall be able to identify it,\" I said.We went to the inner room, and I saw at a glance that it was one of\nthe strangers who had spent the evening at the Three Black Crows, and\nwhom I had afterwards watched and followed.\"The man who has escaped,\" I observed, \"was hump backed.\"\"That tallies with the landlord's statement,\" said the magistrate.\"I have something to relate,\" I said, upon our return to the court,\n\"of my own movements last night after I quitted the inn.\"I then gave the magistrate and Doctor Louis a circumstantial account\nof my movements, without, however, entering into a description of my\nthoughts, only in so far as they affected my determination to protect\nthe doctor and his family from evil designs.They listened with great interest, and Doctor Louis pressed my hand.He understood and approved of the solicitude I had experienced for the\nsafety of his household; it was a guarantee that I would watch over\nhis daughter with love and firmness and protect her from harm.\"But you ran a great risk, Gabriel,\" he said affectionately.The magistrate looked on and smiled; a father himself, he divined the\nundivulged ties by which I and Doctor Louis were bound.\"At what time,\" he asked, \"do you say you left the rogues asleep in\nthe woods?\"\"It was twenty minutes to eleven,\" I replied, \"and at eleven o'clock I\nreached my house, and was received by Martin Hartog's daughter.Hartog\nwas absent, on business his daughter said, and while we were talking,\nand I was taking the keys from her hands, Hartog came home, and\naccompanied me to my bedroom.\"\"Were you at all disturbed in your mind for the safety of your friends\nin consequence of what had passed?\"The men I left slumbering in the woods appeared to\nme to be but ordinary tramps, without any special evil intent, and I\nwas satisfied and relieved.I could not have slept else; it is seldom\nthat I have enjoyed a better night.\"May not their slumbers have been feigned?\"They were in a profound sleep; I made sure of that.\"It is strange,\" mused Doctor Louis, \"how guilt can sleep, and can\nforget the present and the future!\"I then entered into an account of the inspection I had made of the\npath from the gate to the window; it was the magistrate's opinion,\nfrom the position in which the body was found, that there had been no\nstruggle between the two men, and here he and I were in agreement.What I now narrated materially weakened his opinion, as it had\nmaterially weakened mine, and he was greatly perplexed.He was annoyed\nalso that the signs I had discovered, which confirmed the notion that\na struggle must have taken place, had escaped the attention of his\nassistants.He himself had made but a cursory examination of the\ngrounds, his presence being necessary in the court to take the\nevidence of witnesses, to receive reports, and to issue instructions.\"There are so many things to be considered,\" said Doctor Louis, \"in a\ncase like this, resting as it does at present entirely upon\ncircumstantial evidence, that it is scarcely possible some should not\nbe lost sight of.Often those that are omitted are of greater weight\nthan those which are argued out laboriously and with infinite\npatience.Justice is blind, but the law must be Argus-eyed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.You\nbelieve, Gabriel, that there must have been a struggle in my garden?\"\"Such is now my belief,\" I replied.\"Such signs as you have brought before our notice,\" continued the\ndoctor, \"are to you an indication that the man who escaped must have\nmet with severe treatment?\"\"Therefore, that the struggle was a violent one?\"\"Such a struggle could not have taken place without considerable\ndisarrangement about the spot in which it occurred.On an even\npavement you would not look for any displacement of the stones; the\nutmost you could hope to discover would be the scratches made by iron\nheels.But the path from the gate of my house to the back garden, and\nall the walking spaces in the garden itself, are formed of loose\nstones and gravel.No such struggle could take place there without\nconspicuous displacement of the materials of which the ground is\ncomposed.If it took place amongst the flowers, the beds would bear\nevidence.\"Then did you observe such a disarrangement of the stones and gravel\nas I consider would be necessary evidence of the struggle in which you\nsuppose these men to have been engaged?\"I was compelled to admit--but I admitted it grudgingly and\nreluctantly--that such a disarrangement had not come within my\nobservation.\"That is partially destructive of your theory,\" pursued the doctor.\"There is still something further of moment which I consider it my duty\nto say.You are a sound sleeper ordinarily, and last night you slept\nmore soundly than usual.I, unfortunately, am a light sleeper, and it\nis really a fact that last night I slept more lightly than usual.I\nthink, Gabriel, you were to some extent the cause of this.I am\naffected by changes in my domestic arrangements; during many pleasant\nweeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for\na long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence\nupon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of\nyou.\"(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly\nbenignant smile.)\"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the\ndripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of\na cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,\nunusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by\nthe boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must\nhave used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any\ncircumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have\naroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to\nascertain the cause.\"Then,\" said the magistrate, \"how do you account for the injuries the\nman who escaped must have undoubtedly received?\"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.There\nwas a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was\npushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one\nwhose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so\nweak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I\nrecognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the\nThree Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they\nwandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing\nsteadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head\ndrooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran\nthrough him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very\nshort time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be\nobtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,\nand although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was\nin itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to\nsay in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not\na word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,\ninstructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a\nstrict watch should be kept over him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.While the unsuccessful\nexamination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise\nhis eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he\ncould not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and\neach time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a\nshudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the\nroom in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my\nmind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the\nconclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in\nhis right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his\ncrime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the\nmagistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of\npretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a\nsearch for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for\nnone had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of\nthe ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in\nguilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said\nhe had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour\nor so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I\ndeparted alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again\npropounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which\nhe listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been\nbefore that a struggle had taken place.\"But,\" he said, \"whether a struggle for life did or did not take place\nthere is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always\nviewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in\nthis instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,\nto mete out to him the punishment for his crime.\"Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to\ncommunicate to us.\"I have had,\" he said, \"another interview with the prisoner, and have\nsucceeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,\nand again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I\nmoved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to\nloosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if\nI was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the\nfear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely\nbound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He\nrepeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that\nhis question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses\nto convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange\nvoice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of\nmen and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled\ninwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a\nprisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs\nof levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to\nme that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,\nin order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had\ncommitted.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the\nquestion.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and\nif you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in\nthis cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the\nproof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was\nlistening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the\nquestion,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me\nto this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you\nguilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did\nnot kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is\nmurdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have\nkilled me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him\nin thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was\nimposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I\nsaid, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are\nmore powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is\nwhy I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will\nprove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in\nwhich,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,\nwhen you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in\nself-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'\nhe said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel\nperhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You\nsay,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if\nyou had not fled from him.''But,' I\nsaid, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have\nbeen your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon\nyou have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as\nyou say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered\nat this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said\npresently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I\nplayed him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that\nthere should be in the world men with such a low order of\nintelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted\ndoggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get\nnothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his\nridiculous defence, I left him.\"\"Do you think,\" asked Doctor Louis, \"that he has any, even the\nremotest belief in the story?\"I cannot believe it,\" replied the magistrate, \"and yet I confess to\nbeing slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which\nmight be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant\nof the cunning of criminals.\"\"Which means,\" said Doctor Louis, \"that it is really not impossible\nthat the man's mind is diseased.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.\"No,\" said the magistrate, in a positive tone, \"I cannot for a moment\nadmit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a\nstick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it\nseemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been\nno attempt at concealment.\"Here is the weapon,\" I cried, \"with which the deed was done!\"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it.\"Here,\" I said, pointing downwards, \"is the direct line of flight\ntaken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror\nas he ran.\"\"It is an improvised weapon,\" said the magistrate, \"cut but lately\nfrom a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with\neffect.\"I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its\nresemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during\nthe watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and\nsaid that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had\nshaped with my knife.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.\"Do you remember,\" asked the magistrate, \"what you did with it after\nyour suspicions were allayed?\"\"No,\" I replied, \"I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with\nit.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it\nthis morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my\nmind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it\naside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set\nout to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,\nand, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.\"\"It is the only solution,\" said the magistrate.\"So that,\" I said with a sudden thrill of horror, \"I am indirectly\nresponsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been\nresponsible had they used the weapon against those I love!\"We have all happily been spared,\nGabriel,\" he said.We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any\nfurther evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,\nand was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous\nschemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this\nevening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and\nonce, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done\nunconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied\nthat he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had\nentered with respect to my love for his daughter.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.Indeed it was not\npossible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing\nas mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been\ncontrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning\nLauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a\nfeeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview\nwith the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended\nbelief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to\nhave some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure\nwhich had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the\npermission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further\nadmissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the\nman persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his\nown defence.\"I saw him this morning,\" the magistrate said, \"and interrogated him\nwith severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be\ninnocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.\"\"Have you asked him,\" I inquired, \"to give you an account of all that\ntranspired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until\nthe moment he was arrested?\"\"No,\" said the magistrate, \"it did not occur to me to demand of him so\nclose a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should\nhave been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and\nhis invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is\nconscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again\non minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature\nwarns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the\nlowest order of criminals.\"My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial\naccount of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would\nhave extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed\nwhere the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was\nstill bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than\nbefore, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled\nterror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and\nlowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice\nbefore he answered me.\"Why did you not reply to me at once?\"But to this question, although\nI repeated it also twice, he made no response.\"It is useless,\" I said sternly, \"to attempt evasion with me, or to\nthink that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain\na confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it\nfrom you, if you do not give it willingly.\"I understand you,\" he said, keeping his face averted from me, \"but I\nwill not speak.\"\"Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because\nyou have a design against me.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my\nintention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden\nin his mind, and I was resolved to get at it.\"What design can I have against you,\" I said, \"of which you need be\nafraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for\nyou.Soon you\nwill be as dead as the man you murdered.\"\"I did not murder him,\" was the strange reply, \"and you know it.\"\"You are playing the same trick upon me that you\nplayed upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as\nunsuccessful with me.What further danger can threaten you\nthan the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?\"My body is, perhaps,\" he muttered, \"but not my soul.\"\"Oh,\" I said, in a tone of contempt, \"you believe in a soul.\"\"Yes,\" he replied, \"do not you?\"Not out of my fears, but out\nof my hopes.\"\"I have no hopes and no fears,\" he said.\"I have done wrong, but not\nthe wrong with which I am charged.\"His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to\nmake an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance.\"When I next command you,\" I said, \"you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than\nthe pass to which you have brought it by your crime.\"And still he doggedly repeated, \"I have committed no crime.\"\"Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced\nhim to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His\neyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my\ncompelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.He had no power to\nresist me.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the\nweaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became\ndimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we\nremained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke.\"Relate to me,\" I said, \"all that you know from the time you and the\nman who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the\npresent moment.\"We were poor, both of us,\" Pierre commenced, \"and had been poor all\nour lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain\nmeat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had\nbeen in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when\nwe were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;\nstarvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,\nand so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing\nelse was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;\nwhy should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some\nsixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come\nhere and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a\nrich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We\nhad no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a\nslice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the\nmoney he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us\nto Nerac.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple there.We did not hurt the man; a\nknock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to\nthem; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on\nour way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the\nstraightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When\nwe entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money\nleft to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat\ndrinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with\nthe landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place\nwhere we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were\ntalking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach\nmy ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We\nwanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it\nto us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were\nbare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out\nDoctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there\nwould be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past\nmidnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the\ndirection of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have\ncontinued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,\nI had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but\nthe idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I\ndetermined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which\nwe had passed through before we reached the village, and there to\nsleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into\nexecution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I\ndon't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember\nhearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard\nit too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and\nheard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on\ntill we came to the woods, which we entered.Down upon the ground we\nthrew ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I\npretended to be.I did not move;\nI even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it\ndeparted, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired\nwith the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us\nwhich would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the\nnight I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.I\nwoke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the\nway.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses\nhad been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he\nlaughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked\nround the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The\nfront of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we\nmade our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a\nhole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our\nbeing heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough\nto enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We\ndid not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our\nsafety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be\nshed.Our plan was to gag and tie\nup any one who interfered with us.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.My mate and I had had no quarrel;\nwe were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain\ntrue to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked\naway at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,\nfrom the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not\nmove; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when\nI heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club\nwas making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a\nminute, and I turned and saw the demon.I\nslanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,\nfell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,\non my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,\ntearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and\nagain, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,\ntill flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,\nthere was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than\nthe demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking\nme so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag\nmyself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than\nalive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,\nif I don't get it in this!\"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had\nthreatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;\nmurder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him\nin a blacker light.I\nreleased him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before\nme, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had\njust been awakened from sleep.\"You have confessed all,\" I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and\nin the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his\nlips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my\nhope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer.\"If I have said as much,\" he said, \"it is you who have driven me to\nit, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my\ndestruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is\nfalse from beginning to end.\"So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I\nknew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which\nhas been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at\nthe present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and\nfurnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as\nmy wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a\nkind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been\ngreatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read\nthe record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to\ndiscontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no\nman else, no man can dispute my right to make it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.My resolution is, after", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "I\nshall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should\nbegrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is\nrecorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's\nnature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to\nread these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein\nin myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a\ndisease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself\nagainst myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That\nmy nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed\nto the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of\nlight and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to\nfight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the\nissue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain\nsense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have\noccurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I\nshall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to\nforget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was\ninfluenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting\nwith Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a\nfreshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,\nand it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,\nthrough these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my\nbeloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,\nwhich undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor\nLouis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the\npenalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could\nnot, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have\nbeen vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape\nhis just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to\nrepentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was\nstrange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically\ntowards the criminal.\"He laboured, up to the supreme moment,\" said the good priest, in a\ncompassionate tone, \"under the singular hallucination that he was\ngoing before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent\nand apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help\nbeing shaken in my belief that he was guilty.\"\"Not in the sense,\" said Father Daniel, \"that the unhappy man would\nhave had me believe.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.Reason rejects his story as something altogether\ntoo incredulous; and yet I pity him.\"I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have\nbeen useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter\nfrom widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no\nless does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to\nfind excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's\nmisdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may\ndegenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the\ncase with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,\ncan be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,\nhave taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to\nthe village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that\nthey had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.I did not\ngive expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member\nof Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists\nbetween us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on\nmy side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the\nfeelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the\nladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already\nsome reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them\nwith interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their\nfather's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other\nthey are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they\ntake a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and\nthey are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having\nin that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive\nlooks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to\neach other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel\nuntil a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made\nup my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which\nto form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come\nto me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis\nand his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure\nin their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are\nalways more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That\nthey may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than\nprobable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each\nother, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, \"Why\nis this stranger here?I have begged Doctor\nLouis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to\nshorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his\npermission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no\ndoubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that\nif I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would\nbe weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot\nrid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations\nto my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced\nthat they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts\njealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes\nthem to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high\nprinciple.I have the evidence of my senses in proof\nof it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards\nthese brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that\nlatterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie\nabed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose\nthe lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my\nhabit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly\nrambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I\nmused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to\nenjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all\nthe bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to\nthese dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me\nalways the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my\npromised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be\nmine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was\nbarely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring\nearly and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At\ntwelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred\nyards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices\nwithin a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the\nThree Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to\nNerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these\nvoices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I\nstepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not\nbe heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve\nyards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman\nMartin Hartog's daughter.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which\nI stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine\nwhat they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and\nwatched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that\nI should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I\nentertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was\nsorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with\na man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of\nwhich I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry\nto see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his\ncharacter and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed\nof him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no\ndoubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in\nlight regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me\nshowed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they\nhold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit\nassociates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor\nLouis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have\nlasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in\nitself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the\nbrothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question\nthat occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's\ndaughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a\nman of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first\nimpulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,\nand enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,\nEmilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,\nand make light of a matter I deemed so serious.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football there.I should be placed in\nthe position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon\nothers to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was\ncertain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable\nantipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not\ndescend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had\ntransferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at\nthe best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would\nreflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I\ndecided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it\nwas for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point\nof view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain\nwas--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he\nwas trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in\nhis eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these\nqualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by\nwhat I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of\nthe revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and\nMartin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled\ntowards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.This\ninvoluntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness\nof which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had\narrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did\nnot follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable\nand eventful in my life?I am\noverwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked\nhome from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by\nmy side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me\nat the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little\nroom he uses as a study.His face was\ngrave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was\nhis intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his\ndaughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for\nher.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him\nto speak.\"This hour,\" he said, \"is to me most solemn.\"\"It should be,\" he said, \"to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are\ninclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly\nthe whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,\nyou can guess the object of it.\"\"Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us.\"I\ntrembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta\nloved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips.\"My wife and I,\" he continued, \"have been living over again the life\nof our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I\nam not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during\nthese last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our\nHome Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then\nyou will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are\nasked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.\"\"There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel,\" he said, \"because I\nhave used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a\nstranger to us.\"\"That has not been against me, sir,\" I said, \"and is not, I trust.\"\"There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing\nagainst you except--except,\" he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,\n\"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only\nherself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a\ngarden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have\nthe larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have\nthought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures,\" he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his\nlips, \"which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still\nare ours.\"He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its\ncontents.\"Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of\nher bright hair.\"I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents\nof his voice.\"Surely,\" he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,\nwhich I pressed to my lips.\"The little head was once covered with\nthese golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they\nwould have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,\nGabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts\nto heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for\nthe life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a\ngrievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the\nkiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet\nways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God\nreceives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the\nhighest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,\nin the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.\"\"Gabriel, it is an idle phrase\nfor a father holding the position towards you which I do at the\npresent moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only\nchild.\"\"If you have any, sir,\" I said, \"question me, and let me endeavour to\nset your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn\nearnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,\nher honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;\nno other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I\nbeen drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of\nmy spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common\npleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest\nremembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in\nlooking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not\nmine, as you will admit.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.May I claim some small merit--not of my own\npurposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have\nreason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my\nearly life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low\npleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was\never seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Books\nand study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy\nmood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I\nthink of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of\nbirds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it\nsprings from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is\nmine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was\nmeasured to her heart.\"You have said much,\" said Doctor Louis, \"to comfort and assure me,\nand have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my\nmind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first\ndays of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that\nthe happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?\"Even in those early days I felt that I\nloved her.\"\"My wife replied that life\nmust not be dreamt away, that it has duties.\"\"My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only\nenjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,\n'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in\nthe world.'\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.\"Yes, sir, her words come back to me.\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.\"There is something more,\" said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,\n\"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief\nbeacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for\nit.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I\nrecall what followed.Though, to be sure,\" he added, in a slightly\ngayer tone, \"we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode\nhappened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,\n'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be\nproperly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'\"\"Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.\"\"It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event\nof your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be\npainful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious\nto you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is\ntoo narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active\nworker, but I doubt if you would do so.\"\"There is time to think of it, sir.\"And now, if you like, we will join my wife and\ndaughter.\"\"Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?\"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should\nbe left to speak for itself.\"Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I\nobserved nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for\nthe declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta\nto go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if\nshe would accompany us.\"No, my child,\" said the mother, \"I have things in the house to attend\nto.\"So Lauretta and I went out alone.It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over\nher head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever\ngentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to\nwhich I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced\nitself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well.\"I am quite well, Lauretta,\" I replied.\"Then something has annoyed you,\" she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me.\"But there _is_ something,\" she said.\"Yes,\" I said, \"there _is_ something.\"We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and\nabsently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment\nor two and said, \"This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy\na flower.\"\"I was not thinking of it,\" I said; and was about to throw it away\nwhen an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,\nrestrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most\nimpressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could\nhold a place in my heart and mind.\"Lauretta,\" I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,\n\"will you listen to the story of my life?\"\"You have already told me much,\" she said.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.\"You have heard only a part,\" I said, and I gently urged her to a\nseat.\"I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.\"\"I know you as you really are,\" she said, and then a faint colour came\nto her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my\nearnest glances.\"Yes,\" she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings\nof my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was\nconvinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for\never an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so\ntoned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her\nsympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see\nmy life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of\nchildhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon\nitself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the\nsuffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel\nwrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young\nlife I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed\nwith parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of\nwhich would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying\ninfluence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of\nmy story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to\nher home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association\nwith her and hers.\"Whatever fate may be mine,\" I said, \"I shall never reflect upon these\nexperiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without\ngratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am\nhere now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening\nmy heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,\nand if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,\nall my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a\nblessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours.\"My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that\nher face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not\nwithdrawn.\"Lauretta,\" I whispered, \"say 'I love you, Gabriel.'\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.\"I love you, Gabriel,\" she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to\nme.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held\nout her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she\nsaid, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, \"God in His\nmercy keep guard over you!<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.*   *   *   *   *\n\nThese are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this\nday I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS\nREVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,\nTO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,\nCALIFORNIA.I.\n\n\nMy Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have\nbeen extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said\nlittle or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted\nthe centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely\npopulated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe\nmanhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the\nfuture development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in\nhis life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving\ninterest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you\nto be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me\nof your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of\nlife, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to\naccompany you.\"He is young and plastic,\" you said, \"and I can train him to\nhappiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man.\"You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to\nwhich you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to\nconvert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer\nin parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make\nsacrifices for his children.My belief was, and\nis, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into\nprimitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world\nand mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the\ncenturies, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I\nregarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt\neven now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy\nI detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and\nregret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut\nyourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it\nis not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am\nabout to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny\nit has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of\nwhich, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange\nprobably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy\na great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will\nbe interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who\nwere always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to\nit.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks\nupon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but\nyou must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding\nof the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator\nI shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting\npictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my\nopinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable\nthat it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without\nprofitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few\nyears hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical\norder; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory\nis clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal\ncharacter in this drama of life.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as\nRosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I\nshall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the\ntruth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon\nit.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,\nbe strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a\nbusy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so\nsingular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your\nknowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form\nthrough which you will be made familiar not only with the personality\nof Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the\nmethods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such\nas are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as\nmy material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I\nam aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall\nbe presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was\nnot a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an\nintelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the\nstory.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a\nstrict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon\nthe domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to\nmy task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something\nessential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,\ncarefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,\n\"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given\nby Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa.\"The\nprecaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken\nto that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by\nwhich you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for\nthe proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my\ndear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel\nCarew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took\nplace twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew\nmarried was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare\nacquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was\nspread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few\nmonths; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute\ntruth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will\nrecognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected\nfrom one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will\nperplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards\nGabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason\nfor which you will find it difficult to explain.\"Season your\nadmiration for a while;\" before I am at the end of my task the riddle\nwill be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal\nof the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be\nassociated with so strange a man as the writer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.But this is a world of\nmystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual\nworkings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be\nhidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it", "question": "Where is the football?
