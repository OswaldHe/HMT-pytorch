 TO SCIENCE.I.\n\n         Friend of our race, O Science, strong and wise!Though thou wast scorned and wronged and sorely tried,\n         Bound and imprisoned, racked and crucified,\n         Thou dost in life invulnerable rise\n         The glorious leader \u2019gainst our enemies.Thou art Truth\u2019s champion for the domain wide\n         Ye twain shall conquer fighting side by side.Thus thou art strong, and able thou to cope\n         With all thy enemies that yet remain.They fly already from the open plain,\n         And climb, hard-pressed, far up the rugged <DW72>.We hear thy bugle sound o\u2019er land and sea\n         And know that victory abides with thee.Because thou\u2019st conquered all _one_ little world\n           Thou never like the ancient king dost weep,\n           But like the brave Ulysses, on the deep\n           Dost launch thy bark, and, all its sails unfurled,\n           Dost search for new worlds which may lie impearled\n           By happy islands where the billows sleep;\n           Or into sunless seas dost fearless sweep,\n           Braving the tempest which is round thee hurled;\n           Or, bolder still, mounting where far stars shine,\n           From conquest unto conquest thou dost rise\n           And hold\u2019st dominion over realms divine,\n           Where, clear defined unto thy piercing eyes,\n           And fairer than Faith\u2019s yearnful heart did ween\n           Stretches the vastness of the great Unseen.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.E\u2019en where thy sight doth fail thou givest not

thou buildest new worlds from shore to shore\n          With hills perpetual and with mountains lone;\n          To music moving pond\u2019rous stone on stone\n          As unto Orpheus\u2019 lyre

deem thee foe,\n           Though thou dost drive her from the Paradise\n           To which she clings with backward turning eyes,\n           Thou art her angel still, and biddest her go\n           To wider lands where the great rivers flow,\n           And broad and green many a valley lies,\n           Where high and grand th\u2019 eternal mountains rise,\n           And oceans fathomless surge to and fro.Thus thou dost teach her that God\u2019s true and real,\n           Fairer and grander than her dreams _must_ be;\n           Till she shall leave the realm of the Ideal\n           To follow Truth throughout the world with thee,\n           Through earth and sea and up beyond the sun\n           Until the mystery of God is won.Whatever the literary defects, these are noble sonnets.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.But I had rather\ntake my chances in a good Unitarian church than try to nourish the soul\nwith such Platonic love of God.She disliked the Unitarian habit of\nclinging to church traditions and ancient forms of worship; but better\nthese than the materialism of a scientific age.She was absolutely loyal to truth, not\nguilty of that shuffling attitude of modern theologians who have\noutgrown the superstition of Old Testament only to cling more\ntenaciously to the superstition of the New.In the Concord School of\nPhilosophy, and later in her studies as a member of the Ladies\u2019\nHistorical Society of Washington, she was searching for the new faith\nthat should fulfil the old.It might be of interest here to introduce\nselections from some of her Historical Society essays, into the\ncomposition of which she entered with great earnestness.Written toward\nthe close of life, they still retain the freshness and unspoiled\nenthusiasm of youth.One specimen must suffice:\n\n    In thinking of Galileo, and the office of the telescope, which is to\n    give us increase of light, and of the increasing power of the larger\n    and larger lenses, which widens our horizon to infinity, this\n    constantly recurring thought comes to me: how shall we grow into the\n    immensity that is opening before us?The principle of light pervades\n    all space\u2014it travels from star to star and makes known to us all\n    objects on earth and in heaven.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.The great ether throbs and thrills\n    with its burden to the remotest star as with a joy.But there is\n    also an all-pervading force, so subtle that we know not yet how it\n    passes through the illimitable space.But before it all worlds fall\n    into divine order and harmony.It imparts the\n    power of one to all, and gathers from all for the one.What in the\n    soul answers to these two principles is, first, also light or\n    knowledge, by which all things are unveiled; the other which answers\n    to gravitation, and before which all shall come into proper\n    relations, and into the heavenly harmony, and by which we shall fill\n    the heavens with ourselves, and ourselves with heaven, is love.But after all, Angeline Hall gave\nherself to duty and not to philosophy\u2014to the plain, monotonous work of\nhome and neighborhood.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she\nsupplied with her own hands the various family wants\u2014cooked with great\nskill, canned abundance of fruit for winter, and supplied the table from\nday to day with plain, wholesome food.Would that she might have taught\nBostonians to bake beans!If they would try her method, they would\ndiscover that a mutton bone is an excellent substitute for pork.Pork\nand lard she banished from her kitchen.Beef suet is, indeed, much\ncleaner.The chief article of diet was meat, for Mrs.Hall was no\nvegetarian, and the Georgetown markets supplied the best of Virginia\nbeef and mutton.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she provided the\nfamily with warm clothing, and kept it in repair.A large part of her\nlife was literally spent in mending clothes.She never relaxed the rigid\neconomy of Cambridge days.She commonly needed but one servant, for she\nworked with her own hands and taught her sons to help her.The house was\nalways substantially clean from roof to cellar.Nowhere on the whole premises was a bad smell tolerated.While family wants were scrupulously attended to, she stretched forth a\nhand to the poor.The Civil War filled Washington with <DW64>s, and for\nseveral winters Mrs.In\n1872 she was \u201cDirectress\u201d of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth wards; and\nfor a long time she was a member of a benevolent society in Georgetown,\nhaving charge of a section of the city near her residence.For the last\nfourteen years of her life, she visited the Home for Destitute <DW52>\nWomen and Children in north Washington.Her poor <DW52> neighbors\nregarded her with much esteem.She listened to their stories of\ndistress, comforted them, advised them.The aged she admitted to her\nwarm kitchen; and they went away, victuals in their baskets or coins in\ntheir hands, with the sense of having a friend in Mrs.Uncle\nLouis, said to be one hundred and fourteen years old, rewarded her with\na grape-vine, which was planted by the dining room window.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.And \u201cthe\nUncle Louis grape\u201d was the best in the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.At the close of the Civil War she even undertook to redeem two fallen\nIrish women by taking them into her house to work.But their appetite\nfor whiskey was too strong, and they would steal butter, barter it for\nliquor, and come home drunk.On one occasion one of these women took\nlittle Asaph along to visit the saloon; and there his mother found him,\nwith the servant standing by joking with rough men, her dress in shreds.Hall had no time or strength for such charitable enterprises, and\nsoon abandoned them.She was saved from most of the follies of\nphilanthropy by the good sense of her husband, whom she rewarded with\nthe devotion of a faithful wife.His studies and researches, almost from\nthe first, were much too deep for her entire comprehension, but she was\nalways enthusiastic about his work.In the introduction to his\n\u201c_Observations and Orbits of the Satellites of Mars_,\u201d Professor Hall\nchivalrously says:\n\n    In the spring of 1877, the approaching favorable opposition of the\n    planet Mars attracted my attention, and the idea occurred to me of\n    making a careful search with our large Clark refractor for a\n    satellite of this planet.An examination of the literature of the\n    planet showed, however, such a mass of observations of various\n    kinds, made by the most experienced and skillful astronomers that\n    the chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so\n    that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the\n    encouragement of my wife.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Each night she sent her\nhusband to the observatory supplied with a nourishing lunch, and each\nnight she awaited developments with eager interest.I can well remember\nthe excitement at home.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.There was a great secret in the house, and all\nthe members of the family were drawn more closely together by mutual\nconfidence.The moral and intellectual training of her sons has already been\nreferred to.Summer vacations were often spent with her sisters in\nRodman, N.Y.Her mother, who reached the age of eighty years, died in\nthe summer of 1878, when Mrs.Hall became the head of the Stickney\nfamily.Her sisters Mary and Elmina were childless.Ruth had six\nchildren, in whose welfare their Aunt Angeline took a lively interest.The three girls each spent a winter with her in Washington, and when, in\nthe summer of 1881, Nellie was seized with a fatal illness, Aunt\nAngeline was present to care for her.Now and then Charlotte Ingalls,\nwho had prospered in Wisconsin, would come on from the West, and the\nStickney sisters would all be together.The last reunion occurred in the\nsummer of 1891, a year previous to Angeline\u2019s death.It was a goodly\nsight to see the sisters in one wagon, near the old home place; and\nwhen, at Elmina\u2019s house, Angeline was bustling about attending to the\nneeds of the united family, it was good to hear Charlotte exclaim, \u201cTake\ncare, old lady!\u201d She was thirteen years older than Angeline, and seemed\nalmost to belong to an earlier generation.She remembered her father\nwell, and had no doubt acquired from him some of the ancient New\nHampshire customs lost to her younger sisters.Certainly her\nexclamations of \u201cFiddlesticks,\u201d and \u201cWitch-cats,\u201d were quaint and\npicturesque.But it was Angeline who was really best versed in the family history.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.She had made a study of it, in all its branches, and could trace her\ndescent from at least eleven worthy Englishmen, most of whom arrived in\nNew England before 1650.She made excursions to various points in New\nEngland in search of relatives.At Belchertown, Mass., in 1884, she\nfound her grandfather Cook\u2019s first cousin, Mr.He was then\none hundred years old, and remembered how in boyhood he used to go\nskating with Elisha Cook.How brief the history of America in the presence of such a man!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.I\nremember seeing an old New Englander, as late as 1900, who as a boy of\neleven years had seen General Lafayette.It was a treat to hear him\ndescribe the courteous Frenchman, slight of stature, bent with age, but\nactive and polite enough to alight from the stage-coach to shake hands\nwith the people assembled to welcome him in the little village of\nCharlton, Mass.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.At the close of life she longed to\nvisit Europe, but death intervened, and her days were spent in her\nnative country.She passed two summers in the mountains of Virginia.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.In\n1878, with her little son Percival, she accompanied her husband to\nColorado, to observe the total eclipse of the sun.Three years before\nthey had taken the whole family to visit her sister Charlotte\u2019s people\nin Wisconsin.It was through her family loyalty that she acquired the Adirondack\nhabit.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.In the summer of 1882, after the severe sickness of the preceding\nwinter, she was staying with a cousin\u2019s son, a country doctor, in\nWashington County, N.Y.He proposed an outing in the invigorating air of\nthe Adirondacks.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.And so, with her three youngest sons and the doctor\u2019s\nfamily, she drove to Indian Lake, and camped there about a week.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Her\nimprovement was so marked that the next summer, accompanied by three\nsons and her sister Ruth, she drove into the wilderness from the West,\ncamping a few days in a log cabin by the side of Piseco Lake.In 1885,\nsetting out from Rodman again, she drove four hundred miles, passing\nnorth of the mountains to Paul Smith\u2019s, and thence to Saranac Lake\nvillage, John Brown\u2019s farm, Keene Valley, and Lake George, and returning\nby way of the Mohawk Valley.In 1888 she camped with the three youngest\nsons on Lower Saranac, and in 1890 she spent July and August at the\nsummer school of Thomas Davidson, on the side of Mt.One day\nI escorted her and her friend Miss Sarah Waitt to the top of the\nmountain, four or five miles distant, and we spent the night on the\nsummit before a blazing camp-fire.Two years later she was planning\nanother Adirondack trip when death overtook her\u2014at the house of her\nfriend Mrs.Berrien, at North Andover, Mass., July 3, 1892.Her poem \u201cHeracles,\u201d written towards the close of her career, fittingly\ndescribes her own herculean labors:\n\n                               HERACLES.I.\n\n           Genius of labor, mighty

I am sorry the\n    Boston girl is getting to be so helpless.I think all who have to\n    keep some one to take care of them had better leave for Europe on\n    the first steamer.I think co-education would be a great help to both boys and girls.I\n    have never liked schools for girls alone since Harriette Lewis and\n    Antoinette McLain went to Pittsfield to the Young Ladies Institute.Stanton\u2019s advice to her sons, \u201cWhen\n    you marry do choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth.\u201d Now I\n    think a woman needs two kinds of good back-bone.As for Astronomical work, and all kinds of scientific work, there\n    may not be the pressing need there was for it a few centuries ago;\n    but I think our modern theory of progress is nearly right as\n    described by Taine, \u201cas that which founds all our aspirations on the\n    boundless advance of the sciences, on the increase of comforts which\n    their applied discoveries constantly bring to the human condition,\n    and on the increase of good sense which their discoveries,\n    popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.\u201d Of course Ethical\n    teaching must keep pace.It is well to keep the teaching of the\n    Prometheus Bound in mind, that merely material civilization is not\n    enough; and must not stand alone.But the knowledge that we get from\n    all science, that effects follow causes always, will teach perhaps\n    just as effectively as other preaching.This makes me think of the pleasant time Sam and I had when he was\n    home last, reading George Eliot\u2019s Romola.This work is really a\n    great drama, and I am much impressed with the power of it.I would say _Philosophy_ AND Science now and forever one and\n    inseparable....\n\n            With much love\n\n                C.

but, of course, I was more or less restless\nexpecting your father to ride up, and then it's all rather exciting\nbusiness to a novice.I could hear all sorts of birds and beasts stepping\nand fluttering about.I was scared in spite of my best resolution.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.\"That's funny; I never feel that way.I slept like a log after I knew you\nwere comfortable.You must have a better bed and more blankets.The clouds settled over the peaks, and\nragged wisps of gray vapor dropped down the timbered <DW72>s of the\nprodigious amphitheater in which the lake lay.Again Berrie made\neverything snug while her young woodsman toiled at bringing logs for the\nfire.In truth, he was more elated than he had been since leaving school, for\nhe was not only doing a man's work in the world, he was serving a woman\nin the immemorial way of the hewer of wood and the carrier of water.His\nfatigue and the chill of the morning wore away, and he took vast pride in\ndragging long poles down the hillside, forcing Berrie to acknowledge that\nhe was astonishingly strong.\"But don't overdo it,\" she warned.At last fully provided for, they sat contentedly side by side under the\nawning and watched the falling rain as it splashed and sizzled on the\nsturdy fire.\"It's a little like being shipwrecked on a desert island,\nisn't it?\"She served potatoes and\ngrouse, hot biscuit with sugar syrup, and canned peaches, and coffee done\nto just the right color and aroma.He declared it wonderful, and they ate\nwith repeated wishes that the Supervisor might turn up in time to share\ntheir feast; but he did not.Then Berrie said, firmly: \"Now you must take\na snooze, you look tired.\"He was, in truth, not only drowsy but lame and tired.Therefore, he\nyielded to her suggestion.She covered him with blankets and put him away like a child.\"Now you\nhave a good sleep,\" she said, tenderly.With a delicious sense of her protecting care he lay for a few moments\nlistening to the drip of the water on the tent, then drifted away into\npeace and silence.When he woke the ground was again covered with snow, and the girl was\nfeeding the fire with wood which her own hands had supplied.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Hearing him stir, she turned and fixed her eyes upon him with clear, soft\ngaze.\"Quite made over,\" he replied, rising alertly.His cheer, however, was only pretense.\"Something\nhas happened to your father,\" he said.\"His horse has thrown him, or he\nhas slipped and fallen.\"\"How far is\nit down to the ranger station?\"\"Don't you think we'd better close camp and go down there?It is now\nthree o'clock; we can walk it in five hours.\"\"No, I think we'd better stay right here.It's a\nlong, hard walk, and the trail is muddy.\"\"But, dear girl,\" he began, desperately, \"it won't do for us to camp\nhere--alone--in this way another night.\"I don't care what Cliff thinks--I'm done\nwith him--and no one that I really care about would blame us.\"She was\nfully aware of his anxiety now.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.\"It will be _my_ fault if I keep you here longer!\"\"We must\nreach a telephone and send word out.It may be that there's been a big\nsnowfall up above us--or else a windstorm.The trail may be blocked; but\ndon't worry.He may have to go round by Lost Lake pass.\"We'd better pack up and rack down the\ntrail to the ranger's cabin.\"I'm all right, except I'm very lame; but I am anxious to go on.By the\nway, is this ranger Settle married?\"\"No, his station is one of the lonesomest cabins on the forest.\"Nevertheless,\" he decided, \"we'll go.After\nall, the man is a forest officer, and you are the Supervisor's\ndaughter.\"She made no further protest, but busied herself closing the panniers and\nputting away the camp utensils.She seemed to recognize that his judgment\nwas sound.It was after three when they left the tent and started down the trail,\ncarrying nothing but a few toilet articles.\"Should we have left a note for\nthe Supervisor?\"\"There's all the writing he needs,\" she\nassured him, leading the way at a pace which made him ache.She plashed\nplumply into the first puddle in the path.\"No use dodging 'em,\" she\ncalled over her shoulder, and he soon saw that she was right.The trees were dripping, the willows heavy with water, and the mud\nankle-deep--in places--but she pushed on steadily, and he, following in\nher tracks, could only marvel at her strength and sturdy self-reliance.The swing of her shoulders, the poise of her head, and the lithe movement\nof her waist, made his own body seem a poor thing.For two hours they zigzagged down a narrow canyon heavily timbered with\nfir and spruce--a dark, stern avenue, crossed by roaring streams, and\nfilled with frequent boggy meadows whereon the water lay mid-leg deep.\"We'll get out of this very soon,\" she called, cheerily.By degrees the gorge widened, grew more open, more genial.Aspen thickets\nof pale-gold flashed upon their eyes like sunlight, and grassy bunches\nafforded firmer footing, but on the <DW72>s their feet slipped and slid\npainfully.\"We must get to the middle fork\nbefore dark,\" she stopped to explain, \"for I don't know the trail down\nthere, and there's a lot of down timber just above the station.Now that\nwe're cut loose from our camp I feel nervous.As long as I have a tent I\nam all right; but now we are in the open I worry.She studied him with keen and anxious glance, her hand upon his\narm.\"Fine as a fiddle,\" he replied, assuming a spirit he did not possess,\n\"but you are marvelous.\"I can do anything when I have to,\" she replied.\"We've got three hours\nmore of it.\"And she warningly exclaimed: \"Look back there!\"They had reached a point from which the range could be seen, and behold\nit was covered deep with a seamless robe of new snow.\"That's why dad didn't get back last night.He's probably wallowing along\nup there this minute.\"And she set off again with resolute stride.Wayland's pale face and labored breath alarmed her.She was filled with\nlove and pity, but she pressed forward desperately.As he grew tired, Wayland's boots, loaded with mud, became fetters, and\nevery <DW72> greasy with mire seemed an almost insurmountable barricade.He fell several times, but made no outcry.\"I will not add to her\nanxiety,\" he said to himself.At last they came to the valley floor, over which a devastating fire had\nrun some years before, and which was still covered with fallen trees in\ndesolate confusion.She kept on\ntoward the river, although Wayland called attention to a trail leading to\nthe right up over the low grassy hills.For a mile the path was clear,\nbut she soon found herself confronted by an endless maze of blackened\ntree-trunks, and at last the path ended abruptly.Dismayed and halting, she said: \"We've got to go back to that trail which\nbranched off to the right.I reckon that was the highland trail which\nSettle made to keep out of the swamp.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.I thought it was a trail from\nCameron Peak, but it wasn't.She was suffering keenly now, not on her own account, but on his, for she\ncould see that he was very tired, and to climb up that hill again was\nlike punishing him a second time.When she picked up the blazed trail it was so dark that she could\nscarcely follow it; but she felt her way onward, turning often to be sure\nthat he was following.Once she saw him fall, and cried out: \"It's a\nshame to make you climb this hill again.I ought to\nhave known that that lower road led down into the timber.\"Standing close beside him in the darkness, knowing that he was weary,\nwet, and ill, she permitted herself the expression of her love and pity.Putting her arm about him, she drew his cheek against her own, saying:\n\"Poor boy, your hands are cold as ice.\"She took them in her own warm\nclasp.\"Oh, I wish we had never left the camp!\"I shall never forgive\nmyself if you--\" Her voice failed her.[Illustration: SHE FOUND HERSELF CONFRONTED BY AN ENDLESS MAZE\nOF BLACKENED TREE-TRUNKS]\n\nHe bravely reassured her: \"I'm not defeated, I'm just tired.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football.It's better\nto keep moving, anyhow.\"She thrust her hand under his coat and laid it over his heart.\"You are\ntired out,\" she said, and there was anguish in her voice.And, hark, there's a\nwolf!\"\"I hear him; but we are both armed.VIII\n\nTHE OTHER GIRL\n\n\nThe girl's voice stirred the benumbed youth into action again, and he\nfollowed her mechanically.His slender stock of physical strength was\nalmost gone, but his will remained unbroken.At every rough place she\ncame back to him to support him, to hearten him, and so he crept on\nthrough the darkness, falling often, stumbling against the trees,\nslipping and sliding, till at last his guide, pitching down a sharp\n<DW72>, came directly upon a wire fence.\"Here is a fence, and the cabin should be near,\nalthough I see no light.No voice replied, and, keeping Wayland's hand, she felt her way along the\nfence till it revealed a gate; then she turned toward the roaring of the\nstream, which grew louder as they advanced.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.\"The cabin is near the falls,\nthat much I know,\" she assured him.Then a moment later she joyfully\ncried out: \"Here it is!\"Out of the darkness a blacker, sharper shadow rose.Again she called, but\nno one answered.\"The ranger is away,\" she exclaimed, in a voice of\nindignant alarm.Too numb with fatigue, and too dazed by the darkness to offer any aid,\nWayland waited--swaying unsteadily on his feet--while she tried the door.It was bolted, and with but a moment's hesitation, she said: \"It looks\nlike a case of breaking and entering.The windows,\ntoo, were securely fastened.After trying them all, she came back to\nwhere Wayland stood.\"Tony didn't intend to have anybody pushing in,\" she\ndecided.\"But if the windows will not raise they will smash.\"A crash of glass followed, and with a feeling that it was all part of a\ndream, Wayland waited while the girl made way through the broken sash\ninto the dark interior.Her next utterance was a cry of joy: \"Oh, but\nit's nice and warm in here!You'll have to come in\nthe same way I did.\"He was too weak and too irresolute to respond immediately, and, reaching\nout, she took him by the arms and dragged him across the sill.A delicious warmth, a grateful dryness, a\nsense of shelter enfolded him like a garment.The place smelled\ndeliciously of food, of fire, of tobacco.Leading him toward the middle of the room, Berrie said: \"Stand here till\nI strike a light.\"As her match flamed up Norcross found himself in a rough-walled cabin, in\nwhich stood a square cook-stove, a rude table littered with dishes, and\nthree stools made of slabs.It was all very rude; but it had all the\nvalue of a palace at the moment.She located an oil-lamp, some\npine-wood, and a corner cupboard.In a few moments the lamp was lit, the\nstove refilled with fuel, and she was stripping Wayland's wet coat from\nhis back, cheerily discoursing as she did so.\"Here's one of Tony's old\njackets, put that on while I see if I can't find some dry stockings for\nyou.Sit right down here by the stove; put your feet in the oven.I'll\nhave a fire in a jiffy.Now I'll start the\ncoffee-pot.\"She soon found the coffee, but it was unground.\"Wonder,\nwhere he keeps his coffee-mill.\"She rummaged about for a few minutes,\nthen gave up the search.\"Well, no matter, here's the coffee, and here's\na hammer.One of the laws of the trail is this: If you can't do a thing\none way, do it another.\"She poured the coffee beans into an empty tomato-can and began to pound\nthem with the end of the hammer handle, laughing at Wayland's look of\nwonder and admiration.\"Necessity sure is the mother of invention out\nhere.Isn't it nice to own a roof and four walls?I'm going to close up that window as soon as I get the coffee started.\"Oh yes, I'm all right now,\" he replied; but he didn't look it, and her\nown cheer was rather forced.He was in the grasp of a nervous chill, and\nshe was deeply apprehensive of what the result of his exposure might be.It seemed as if the coffee would never come to a boil.\"I depend on that to brace you up,\" she said.After hanging", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "She brought his supper to him and\nsat beside him while he ate and drank.\"You must go right to bed,\" she urged, as she studied his weary eyes.The hot, strong coffee revived him physically and brought back a little\nof his courage, and he said: \"I'm ashamed to be such a weakling.\"\"It's not your fault that you are weak.Now,\nwhile I am eating my supper you slip off your wet clothes and creep into\nTony's bunk, and I'll fill one of these syrup-cans with hot water to put\nat your feet.\"It was of no use for him to protest against her further care.She\ninsisted, and while she ate he meekly carried out her instructions, and\nfrom the delicious warmth and security of his bed watched her moving\nabout the stove till the shadows of the room became one with the dusky\nfigures of his sleep.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.A moment later something falling on the floor woke him with a start, and,\nlooking up, he found the sun shining, and Berrie confronting him with\nanxious face.How do you feel this\n_morning_?\"\"Is it to-morrow or the next week?\"Just keep where you are\ntill the sun gets a little higher.\"<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.She drew near and put a hand on his\nbrow.Oh, I hope this trip hasn't set you\nback.\"He laid his hands together, and then felt of his pulse.\"I don't seem to\nhave a temperature.I just feel lazy, limp and lazy;

all we can do is to stand pat and act as if we belonged here.\"\"Very well,\" he replied, moving stiffly toward the door.\"Here's where I\ncan be of some service.As our hero crawled out into the brilliant sunshine some part of his\ncourage came back to him.Though lame in every muscle, he was not ill.His head was clear, and his breath full\nand deep.\"My lungs are all right,\" he said to himself.And he looked round him with a new-born admiration of the\nwooded hills which rose in somber majesty on either side the roaring\nstream.\"How different it all looks this morning,\" he said, remembering\nthe deep blackness of the night.The beat of hoofs upon the bridge drew his attention to the cavalcade,\nwhich the keen eyes of the girl had detected as it came over the ridge to\nthe east.The party consisted of two men and two women and three\npack-horses completely outfitted for the trail.One of the women, spurring her horse to the front, rode serenely up to\nwhere Wayland stood, and called out: \"Good morning.He perceived at once that the speaker was an alien like himself, for she\nwore tan- riding-boots, a divided skirt of expensive cloth, and a\njaunty, wide-rimmed sombrero.She looked, indeed, precisely like the\nheroine of the prevalent Western drama.Her sleeves, rolled to the elbow,\ndisclosed shapely brown arms, and her neck, bare to her bosom, was\nequally sun-smit;

and\nin five minutes they were on the friendliest terms--talking of mutual\nacquaintances--a fact which both puzzled and hurt Berea.Their laughter\nangered her, and whenever she glanced at them and detected Siona looking\ninto Wayland's face with coquettish simper, she was embittered.She was\nglad when Moore came in and interrupted the dialogue.Norcross did not relax, though he considered the dangers of\ncross-examination almost entirely passed.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.In this he was mistaken, for no\nsooner was the keen edge of Mrs.Belden's hunger dulled than her\ncuriosity sharpened.\"The horses got away, and he had to go back after them,\" again responded\nBerrie, who found the scrutiny of the other girl deeply disconcerting.\"Any minute now,\" she replied, and in this she was not deceiving them,\nalthough she did not intend to volunteer any information which might\nembarrass either Wayland or herself.It's romantic enough to be the\nback-drop in a Bret Harte play.\"I know a Norcross, a Michigan lumberman,\nVice-President of the Association.Is he, by any chance, a relative?\"\"Only a father,\" retorted Wayland, with a smile.\"But don't hold me\nresponsible for anything he has done.And what is the son of W. W.\nNorcross doing out here in the Forest Service?\"The change in her father's tone was not lost upon Siona, who ceased her\nbanter and studied the young man with deeper interest, while Mrs.Belden,\ndetecting some restraint in Berrie's tone, renewed her questioning:\n\"Where did you camp last night?\"\"I don't see how the horses got away.There's a pasture here, for we rode\nright through it.\"Berrie was aware that each moment of delay in explaining the situation\nlooked like evasion, and deepened the significance of her predicament,\nand yet she could not bring herself to the task of minutely accounting\nfor her time during the last two days.We're\ngoing into camp at the mouth of the West Fork,\" he said, as he rose.\"Tell Tony and the Supervisor that we want to line out that timber at the\nearliest possible moment.\"Siona, who was now distinctly coquetting with Wayland, held out her hand.\"I hope you'll find time to come up and see us.I know we have other\nmutual friends, if we had time to get at them.\"I'm not at all\nsure that I shall have a moment's leave; but I will call if I can\npossibly do so.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.They started off at last without having learned in detail anything of the\nintimate relationship into which the Supervisor's daughter and young\nNorcross had been thrown, and Mrs.Belden was still so much in the dark\nthat she called to Berrie: \"I'm going to send word to Cliff that you are\nover here.He'll be crazy to come the minute he finds it out.\"\"That would be pleasant,\" he said, smilingly.On the contrary, she remained very\ngrave.\"I wish that old tale-bearer had kept away.She's going to make\ntrouble for us all.And that girl, isn't she a spectacle?She seems a very nice, sprightly person.\"Why does she go\naround with her sleeves rolled up that way, and--and her dress open at\nthe throat?\"\"Oh, those are the affectations of the moment.She wants to look tough\nand boisterous.That's the fad with all the girls, just now.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.It's only a\nharmless piece of foolishness.\"She could not tell him how deeply she resented his ready tone of\ncamaraderie with the other girl; but she was secretly suffering.It hurt\nher to think that he could forget his aches and be so free and easy with\na stranger at a moment's notice.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Under the influence of that girl's smile\nhe seemed to have quite forgotten his exhaustion and his pain.It was\nwonderful how cheerful he had been while she was in sight.In all this Berrie did him an injustice.He had been keenly conscious,\nduring every moment of the time, not only of his bodily ills, but of\nBerrie, and he had kept a brave face in order that he might prevent\nfurther questioning on the part of a malicious girl.It was his only way\nof being heroic.Now that the crisis was passed he was quite as much of a\nwreck as ever.\"I hope they won't happen to meet father on the\ntrail.\"\"Perhaps I should go with them and warn him.\"\"Oh, it doesn't matter,\" she wearily answered.Belden will\nnever rest till she finds out just where we've been, and just what we've\ndone.He understood her fear, and yet he was unable to comfort her in the only\nway she could be comforted.That brief encounter with Siona Moore--a girl\nof his own world--had made all thought of marriage with Berea suddenly\nabsurd.Without losing in any degree the sense of gratitude he felt for\nher protecting care, and with full acknowledgment of her heroic support\nof his faltering feet, he revolted from putting into words a proposal of\nmarriage.\"I love her,\" he confessed to himself, \"and she is a dear,\nbrave girl; but I do not love her as a man should love the woman he is to\nmarry.\"Berea sensed the change in\nhis attitude, and traced it to the influence of the coquette whose\nsmiling eyes and bared arms had openly challenged admiration.It saddened\nher to think that one so fine as he had seemed could yield even momentary\ntribute to an open and silly coquette.IX\n\nFURTHER PERPLEXITIES\n\n\nWayland, for his part, was not deceived by Siona Moore.He knew her kind,\nand understood her method of attack.He liked her pert ways, for they\nbrought back his days at college, when dozens of just such misses lent\ngrace and humor and romance to the tennis court and to the football\nfield.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the football.She carried with her the aroma of care-free, athletic girlhood.Flirtation was in her as charming and almost as meaningless as the\npreening of birds on the bank of a pool in the meadow.Speaking aloud, he said: \"Miss Moore travels the trail with all known\naccessories, and I've no doubt she thinks she is a grand campaigner; but\nI am wondering how she would stand such a trip as that you took last\nnight.I don't believe she could have done as well as I. She's the\nimitation--you're the real thing.\"The praise involved in this speech brought back a little of Berrie's\nhumor.\"I reckon those brown boots of hers would have melted,\" she said,\nwith quaint smile.\"If it had not been for you, dear girl, I would be\nlying up there in the forest this minute.Nothing but your indomitable\nspirit kept me moving.I shall be deeply hurt if any harm comes to you on\naccount of me.\"\"If it hadn't been for me you wouldn't have started on that trip last\nnight.It would have been better for us both if\nwe had stayed in camp, for we wouldn't have met these people.\"\"That's true,\" he replied; \"but we didn't know that at the time.We acted\nfor the best, and we must not blame ourselves, no matter what comes of\nit.\"<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk there.They fell silent at this point, for each was again conscious of their new\nrelationship.She, vaguely suffering, waited for him to resume the\nlover's tone, while he, oppressed by the sense of his own shortcomings\nand weakness, was planning an escape.\"It's all nonsense, my remaining in\nthe forest.I'll tell McFarlane", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Perceiving his returning weakness and depression, Berea insisted on his\nlying down again while she set to work preparing dinner.\"There is no\ntelling when father will get here,\" she said.\"And Tony will be hungry\nwhen he comes.He obeyed her silently, and, going to the bunk, at once fell asleep.How\nlong he slept he could not tell, but he was awakened by the voice of the\nranger, who was standing in the doorway and regarding Berrie with a\nround-eyed stare.He was a tall, awkward fellow of about thirty-five, plainly of the\nfrontier type; but a man of intelligence.At the end of a brief\nexplanation Berrie said, with an air of authority: \"Now you'd better ride\nup the trail and bring our camp outfit down.We can't go back that way,\nanyhow.\"\"All right, Miss Berrie, but perhaps\nyour tenderfoot needs a doctor.\"I'm a\nlittle lame, that's all.Get up\nyour horses, Tony, and by that time I'll have some dinner ready.\"\"All right, Miss Berrie,\" replied the man, and turned away.Hardly had he crossed the bridge on his way to the pasture, when Berrie\ncried out: \"There comes daddy.\"Wayland joined her at the door, and stood beside her watching the\nSupervisor, as he came zigzagging down the steep hill to the east, with\nall his horses trailing behind him roped together head-to-tail.\"He's had to come round by Lost Lake,\" she exclaimed.\"He'll be tired\nout, and absolutely starved.she shouted in greeting, and the\nSupervisor waved his hand.There was something superb in the calm seat of the veteran as he slid\ndown the <DW72>.He kept his place in the saddle with the air of the rider\nto whom hunger, fatigue, windfalls, and snowslides were all a part of the\nday's work; and when he reined in before the door and dropped from his\nhorse, he put his arm about his daughter's neck with quiet word: \"I\nthought I'd find you here.\"All right, daddy; but what about you?The blamed cayuses kept just ahead of me all\nthe way.\"I couldn't get back over the high pass.Had to\ngo round by Lost Lake, and to cap all, Old Baldy took a notion not to\nlead.Oh, I've had a peach of a time; but here I am.\"Yes, they're in camp up the trail.Norcross, take my horses down to the pasture.\"\"Let me do that, daddy, Mr.You see, we started down here late yesterday afternoon.It was\nraining and horribly muddy, and I took the wrong trail.The darkness\ncaught us and we didn't reach the station till nearly midnight.\"\"I guess I made a mistake, Supervisor;\nI'm not fitted for this strenuous life.\"\"I didn't intend to pitchfork you into\nthe forest life quite so suddenly,\" he said.Nevertheless Wayland went out, believing that Berrie wished to be alone\nwith her father for a short time.As he took his seat McFarlane said: \"You stayed in camp till yesterday\nafternoon, did you?\"\"Yes, a little; it mostly rained.\"\"It stormed up on the divide like a January blizzard.That's at the\nlake, I reckon?\"\"Yes, I was just sending Tony after it.But, father, if you go up to\nMoore's camp, don't say too much about what has happened.Don't tell them\njust when you took the back-trail, and just how long Wayland and I were\nin camp.\"\"Because--You know what an old gossip Mrs.She's an awful talker, and our being\ntogether up there all that time will give her a chance.\"A light broke in on the Supervisor's brain.In the midst of his\npreoccupation as a forester he suddenly became the father.His eyes\nnarrowed and his face darkened.The old rip could make a\nwhole lot of capital out of your being left in camp that way.At the same\ntime I don't believe in dodging.The worst thing we could do would be to\ntry to blind the trail.\"No, he was down the valley after his mail.\"\"That's another piece of bad luck, too.How much\ndoes the old woman know at present?\"The party made an extremely picturesque\ngroup--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the\nladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite\nreminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in\nwhich George alone quite came up to the regulation \"63 inches.\"Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,\nwho would have given their brightest buttons, every \"man\" of them, to be\nthe most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery\nand the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful\nfashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the\ntents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked\nin); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is\nthe greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy\nmade her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous \"glass agates;\"\none of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other\npatriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter\nclimbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a\nbough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with \"ox hearts;\" Harry\neagerly offered to make any number of \"stunning baskets\" out of the\nstones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before.was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A\nprivate remark was also circulated to the effect that \"Miss Jessie was\nstunningly pretty.\"The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully\nto send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off\nhighly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take\nthe afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the\nboys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two\no'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,\nconcerning the event to come off on the morrow.\"I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review,\" said\nJimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and\nlooking solemnly round the table.\"March about,\nand form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming\n\"parade rest,\" \"'der humps!\"and the rest of it; and finish off by\nfiring off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any\npossibility!\"\"But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder,\" said Peter\ndisconsolately.\"You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last\nFourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!\"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George\nsaid, \"You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?\"\"No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped\nthe 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the\nnasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play\nwith powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.\"\"Well, we must take it out in marching, then,\" said Freddy, with a\ntremendous sigh.\"No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!\"\"I have\nsome 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of\nthe cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother\nthis afternoon and get them.\"The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,\ncoming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the\nolder ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his\nbright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,\nhe heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,\nschoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy.\"I ran after you all the way,\" he pantingly said.\"I want to tell you,\ndear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,\nand how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as\nanything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and\nI feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable\ncourt martial.\"\"There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!\"was the hearty\nresponse; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion.\"It\nwas my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how\nsilly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.\"\"Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so\nwe will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this\nabominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to\ndescribe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed\nZouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the\nfollowing day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in\nhistory for one of the most splendid reviews on record.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.They almost ran\npoor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible\nvariety of exercise known to \"Hardee's Tactics,\" and nearly dislocated\ntheir shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward\nall at once when they went at \"double quick;\" at the same time keeping\nthe other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful\noperation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered\ndown nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and\na special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's\n\"'der arms!\"meant \"shoulder arms,\" and when \"order arms\" (or bringing\nall the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never\nwas such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of\nthe preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy\nclouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and\nnot a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of\nthe day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun\nwould be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry\nlet fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding\nhigh council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of\nat the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a\nmoment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn\nentered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of\neager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a\ncolony of rooks.\"Patience, patience, my good friends!\"Schermerhorn, holding\nup a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double\nheaders,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,\nand they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left\nfor you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in\ngeneral--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,\nand then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end\nof the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can\nhelp at present;\" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,\nunder strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which\nsuddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as\nthey could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four\no'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after\nanother, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and\nsoon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown\nreason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little\ntrilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,\nfolded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to\ndo with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in\nequal danger of irremediable \"mussing,\" as she fidgetted about on the\ncarriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs\nin the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best\nview of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the\nwhite tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a\nmagnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the\nlawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental\ngrounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view\nwas bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could\nbe seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit\nof regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice\nwas heard shouting, \"Are ye all ready now?and to\nthe melodious notes of \"Dixie,\" performed by the band, which was\nstationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry\nmarching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious\nmandates as, \"Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the\nhouse!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and\ngentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed\nZouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood\nlike statues, without so much as winking.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,\nwhile Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:\n\n\"To the rear--open order!\"and the rear rank straightway fell back;\nexecuting, in fact, that wonderful \"tekkinapesstoth'rare\" which had\npuzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those\nother wonderful orders:\n\n          \"P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,\nwith such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond\nmeasure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on\neach side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,\ndeclared \"It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!\"a\ncelebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened\nhis pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at\nlast produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this\nvolume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they\nwould give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to\nthe gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: \"DOUBLE-QUICK.\"]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the\nregiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,\nformed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called \"breaking into\nplatoons,\" showed how to \"wheel on the right flank,\" and all manner of\nother mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the\norder, they started at \"double quick\" (which is the most comical\ntritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Round after round of applause greeted the\nZouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off\ntheir saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in\nreturn, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the\nlittle remaining breath they had after the \"double quick.\"Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of\ntheir rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went\nthrough some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and\njump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to\nrather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, \"Close up\nin ranks to dismiss,\" when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and\nJessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,\n\"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony\nto go through with.\"The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could\nbe coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a\ngreat hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came\ntripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.Over\nher snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and\nblue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils\nencircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It\nwas made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was\npainted an American eagle, and on the other the words \"Dashahed\nZouaves,\" surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.She advanced\nto the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little\ntremulous, but very distinct, she said:\n\n          \"COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:\n\n          \"I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,\n          on the success you have achieved.You have shown\n          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a\n          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you\n          the colors of your regiment!\"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are\n          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you\n          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath\n          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down\n          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your\n          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name\n          of the Union!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as\nhe advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our\nlittle Colonel came out bright, sure enough.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.Perhaps not another member\nof the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have\nthought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with\nthe right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice\nthat he responded:\n\n          \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n\n          \"I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the\n          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,\n          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we\n          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness\n          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we\n          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we\n          fight, they shall never float over a retreating\n          battalion!\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his\nhand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began\nplaying a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some\nlady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss\nLucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:\n\n          \"We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--\n          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;\n          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--\n          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,\n          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night\n          And the standard that guides us forever shall be\n          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"A handful of living--an army of dead,\n          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;\n          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain\n          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,\n          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see\n          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear\n          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;\n          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,\n          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,\n          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,\n          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the\nband struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves\nmarching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a\nbountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner\nof \"goodies,\" as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on\nthe sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a\nlarge flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the\nother officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took\ntheir seats.The other children found places around the table, and a\nmerrier fete champetre never was seen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.The band continued to play lively\nairs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,\nthat nobody looked cross for a single minute!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement\namong the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in\nsuch fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves\ntheir flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the\nsupper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the\nbeginning of the week.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,\nof getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good\nfriends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a\npleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was\nquite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as\nthe company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the\nscene.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and\ngentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly\npretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its\ncentre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all\ncrowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and\nadmiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and\nlistening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or\ngrown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,\ncentral figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful\nfor the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.The old man had\nscarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no\none else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he\nmoved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and\naffection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier\nbeat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the\nyoung Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental\ncolors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes\nthem out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once\nmore the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with\nquivering lip and flashing eye, \"Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,\nI'll live and die a soldier!\"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful\nplanet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the\ncamp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly\nached; and then they all shook hands with \"dear\" Jessie, as Charley was\nheard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her\nsoft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she\ncertainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the\ngood people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving\ntheir handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and\nso, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended\nthe very end of\n\n                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that \"day of disaster,\" when Camp McClellan\nmust be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,\nthought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five\ndays, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very\nshortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the\nbreaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by\nthe early afternoon boat.\"Is it possible we have been here a week?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat\ndown to breakfast.\"It seems as if we had only come yesterday.\"\"I don't want\nto go to Newport a bit.\"To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!\"added Tom, with a little\nblush.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.\"I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's\none too many rebels in the family.\"cried George Chadwick; \"the Pringles are a first rate\nfamily; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!\"and George gave\nTom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite\nbrought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and\nproceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.They were not\nvery scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the\nbusiness was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and\nthen jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,\nand under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and\nplaced them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving\nthem to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;\nfor, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own\naffairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when\nit comes in the form of _play_.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football there.Just as the cart, with its vicious\nlittle wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself\nout of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black\nCanadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall\nby a young lady in a saucy \"pork pie\" straw hat, who was driving--no\nother than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly\nsurrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, \"Jessie\nbegged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her.\"Really,\" repeated Freddy; \"but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just\nin time to see us off.\"\"You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all,\" said George;\n\"you will see the tents come down with a run presently.\"As he spoke, the donkey\ncart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and\nprepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,\ntwo of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from\none corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which\nsupported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated \"Now!\"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,\njust as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the\nfirst one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was\ndetached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and\ncharged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this\npurpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in\nhis hands.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it\nrapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, \"Come, boys, are you ready?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.Jump in,\nthen, it is time to start for the boat.\"The boys turned and saw the\ncarriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to\nconvey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm\nwas rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony\nchaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to\nadore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and\nold Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate \"Good-by, my little\nColonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as\nlong as he lives.\"It would have seemed like insulting the old man to\noffer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome\ngilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of\nthe regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of\n\"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond\nthe capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on\nriding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of\ncarrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,\nwith that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with\nthree ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the\nregiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to\nsee the last of \"dear Jessie,\" until the locusts hid them from sight,\nwhen they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn\naccompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red\nbrickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the\nlovely green of the country.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk there.Schermerhorn's advice, the party\ntook possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be\nwaiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers\nstreet, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the\ndepot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they\nhad to travel all the", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth\navenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine\nstyle, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping\nat the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one\nand another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon\nas possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they\nmarched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, \"I tell you\nwhat, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me\ngo to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I\ncan't think of anything else!\"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; \"and,\nFred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your\nregiment, won't you?\"answered Freddy; \"but you're the oldest, Tom,\nand, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget\nme when you come to your command!\"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to\ncome back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang\nthe bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of\neminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in\nhand, saying, \"Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll\nnever leave the Union!\"and the last words he heard Tom say were, \"No,\nby George, _never_!\"*       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history\nof Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends\nDr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had\nmany a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the\nbeautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed\nin every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and\nlearn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to\nBaltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join\nFreddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger\nin after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the\nfield, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant\nyoung friend,\n\n                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of \"Colonel\nFreddy,\" and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed\nand breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off\ntheir seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when\nanything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful\nstory that was seen \"before it was printed,\" and a great many \"oh's\" and\n\"ah's\" testified to their appreciation of the gallant \"Dashahed\nZouaves.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true\nstory of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had\nbeen read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang\nup once more, exclaiming; \"Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,\nmayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?\"cried his sister; \"I wish I had been Jessie; what a\npity it wasn't all true!\"\"And what if I should tell you,\" said their mother, laughing, \"that a\nlittle bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was\nwonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.\"Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!\"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more\nquestions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time\nthey paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg\nher to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about\nit.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at\nlast one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more\nstories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,\nwhich looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; \"Aunt Fanny's\ndaughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!\"and dressing himself in a\ndouble quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,\nforgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of\nlightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;\nshouting, \"Come, get up!here's another Sock story for\nus!\"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's\nstockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to\ntheir places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the\nwrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the\nwhole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored\nmaxim, \"The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;\" George, meanwhile,\nperforming a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his\nfather opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down\nstairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to\nexamine this second instalment of the Sock stories.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.They found it was\nagain a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read\n\"GERMAN SOCKS.\"\"These must be more stories like that\ndear 'Little White Angel.'\"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the\nfirst story, it was found to be called, \"God's Pensioners;\" and\ncommenced, \"It was a cold--\" but stop!This book was to be devoted\nto \"Colonel Freddy;\" but if you will only go to Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.Leavitt's, the\npublishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock\nStories.*       *       *       *       *\n\nTranscriber's Notes:\n\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 41, \"dilemna\" changed to \"dilemma\" (horns of this dilemma)\n\nPage 81, \"arttisically\" changed to \"artistically\" (his fork\nartistically)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.For observe, the smaller and\ninferior subject remains subordinate, however richly finished; but the\nhuman sculpture can only be subordinate by being imperfect.The\nrealisation is, however, in all cases, dangerous except under most\nskilful management, and the abstraction, if true and noble, is almost\nalways more delightful.[70]\n\n[Illustration: Plate VIII.PALAZZO DEI BADOARI PARTECIPAZZI.]X. What, then, is noble abstraction?It is taking first the essential\nelements of the thing to be represented, then the rest in the order of\nimportance (so that wherever we pause we shall always have obtained more\nthan we leave behind), and using any expedient to impress what we want\nupon the mind, without caring about the mere literal accuracy of such\nexpedient.Suppose, for instance, we have to represent a peacock: now a\npeacock has a graceful neck, so has a swan; it has a high crest, so has\na cockatoo; it has a long tail, so has a bird of Paradise.But the whole\nspirit and power of peacock is in those eyes of the tail.It is true,\nthe argus pheasant, and one or two more birds, have something like them,\nbut nothing for a moment comparable to them in brilliancy: express the\ngleaming of the blue eyes through the plumage, and you have nearly all\nyou want of peacock, but without this, nothing; and yet those eyes are\nnot in relief; a rigidly _true_ sculpture of a peacock's form could have\nno eyes,--nothing but feathers.Here, then, enters the stratagem of\nsculpture; you _must_ cut the eyes in relief, somehow or another; see\nhow it is done in the peacock on the opposite page; it is so done by\nnearly all the Byzantine sculptors: this particular peacock is meant to\nbe seen at some distance (how far off I know not, for it is an\ninterpolation in the building where it occurs, of which more hereafter),\nbut at all events at a distance of thirty or forty feet; I have put it\nclose to you that you may see plainly the rude rings and rods which\nstand for the eyes and quills, but at the just distance their effect is\nperfect.And the simplicity of the means here employed may help us, both\nto some clear understanding of the spirit of Ninevite and Egyptian work,\nand to some perception of the kind of enfantillage or archaicism to\nwhich it may be possible, even in days of advanced science, legitimately\nto return.The architect has no right, as we said before, to require of\nus a picture of Titian's in order to complete his design; neither has he\nthe right to calculate on the co-operation of perfect sculptors, in\nsubordinate capacities.Far from this; his business is to dispense with\nsuch aid altogether, and to devise such a system of ornament as shall be\ncapable of execution by uninventive and even unintelligent workmen; for\nsupposing that he required noble sculpture for his ornament, how far\nwould this at once limit the number and the scale of possible buildings?Architecture is the work of nations; but we cannot have nations of great\nsculptors.Every house in every street of every city ought to be good\narchitecture, but we cannot have Flaxman or Thorwaldsen at work upon it:\nnor, even if we chose only to devote ourselves to our public buildings,\ncould the mass and majesty of them be great, if we required all to be\nexecuted by great men; greatness is not to be had in the required\nquantity.Giotto may design a campanile, but he cannot carve it; he can\nonly carve one or two of the bas-reliefs at the base of it.And with\nevery increase of your fastidiousness in the execution of your ornament,\nyou diminish the possible number and grandeur of your buildings.Do not\nthink you can educate your workmen, or that the demand for perfection\nwill increase the supply: educated imbecility and finessed foolishness\nare the worst of all imbecilities and foolishnesses; and there is no\nfree-trade measure, which will ever lower the price of brains,--there is\nno California of common sense.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Exactly in the degree in which you\nrequire your decoration to be wrought by thoughtful men, you diminish\nthe extent and number of architectural works.Your business as an\narchitect, is to calculate only on the co-operation of inferior men, to\nthink for them, and to indicate for them such expressions of your\nthoughts as the weakest capacity can comprehend and the feeblest hand\ncan execute.This is the definition of the purest architectural\nabstractions.They are the deep and laborious thoughts of the greatest\nmen, put into such easy letters that they can be written by the\nsimplest._They are expressions of the mind of manhood by the hands of\nchildhood._\n\nSec.And now suppose one of those old Ninevite or Egyptian builders,\nwith a couple of thousand men--mud-bred, onion-eating creatures--under\nhim, to be set to work, like so many ants, on his temple sculptures.He can put them through a granitic exercise\nof current hand; he can teach them all how to curl hair thoroughly into\ncroche-coeurs, as you teach a bench of school-boys how to shape\npothooks; he can teach them all how to draw long eyes and straight\nnoses, and how to copy accurately certain well-defined lines.Then he\nfits his own great design to their capacities; he takes out of king, or\nlion, or god, as much as was expressible by croche-coeurs and granitic\npothooks; he throws this into noble forms of his own imagining, and\nhaving mapped out their lines so that there can be no possibility of\nerror, sets his two thousand men to work upon them, with a will, and so\nmany onions a day.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.We have, with\nChristianity, recognised the individual value of every soul; and there\nis no intelligence so feeble but that its single ray may in some sort\ncontribute to the general light.This is the glory of Gothic\narchitecture, that every jot and tittle, every point and niche of it,\naffords room, fuel, and focus for individual fire.But you cease to\nacknowledge this, and you refuse to accept the help of the lesser mind,\nif you require the work to be all executed in a great manner.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.Your\nbusiness is to think out all of it nobly, to dictate the expression of\nit as far as your dictation can assist the less elevated intelligence:\nthen to leave this, aided and taught as far as may be, to its own simple\nact and effort; and to rejoice in its simplicity if not in its power,\nand in its vitality if not in its science.We have, then, three orders of ornament, classed according to\nthe degrees of correspondence of the executive and conceptive minds.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.We\nhave the servile ornament, in which the executive is absolutely subjected\nto the inventive,--the ornament of the great Eastern nations, more\nespecially Hamite, and all pre-Christian, yet thoroughly noble in its\nsubmissiveness.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.Then we have the mediaeval system, in which the mind of\nthe inferior workman is recognised, and has full room for action, but is\nguided and ennobled by the ruling mind.This is the truly Christian and\nonly perfect system.Finally, we have ornaments expressing the endeavor\nto equalise the executive and inventive,--endeavor which is Renaissance\nand revolutionary, and destructive of all noble architecture.Thus far, then, of the incompleteness or simplicity of execution\nnecessary in architectural ornament, as referred to the mind.Next we\nhave to consider that which is required when it is referred to the\nsight, and the various modifications of treatment which are rendered\nnecessary by the variation of its distance from the eye.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.I say\nnecessary: not merely expedient or economical.It is foolish to carve\nwhat is to be seen forty feet off with the delicacy which the eye\ndemands within two yards; not merely because such delicacy is lost in\nthe distance, but because it is a great deal worse than lost:--the\ndelicate work has actually worse effect in the distance than rough work.This is a fact well known to painters, and, for the most part,\nacknowledged by the critics of painters, namely, that there is a certain\ndistance for which a picture is painted; and that the finish, which is\ndelightful if that distance be small, is actually injurious if the\ndistance be great: and, moreover, that there is a particular method of\nhandling which none but consummate artists reach, which has its effects\nat the intended distance, and is altogether hieroglyphical and\nunintelligible at any other.This, I say, is acknowledged in painting,\nbut it is not practically acknowledged in architecture; nor until my\nattention was especially directed to it, had I myself any idea of the\ncare with which this great question was studied by the mediaeval\narchitects.On my first careful examination of the capitals of the upper\narcade of the Ducal Palace at Venice, I was induced, by their singular\ninferiority of workmanship, to suppose them posterior to those of the\nlower arcade.It was not till I discovered that some of those which I\nthought the worst above, were the best when seen from below, that I\nobtained the key to this marvellous system of adaptation; a system\nwhich I afterwards found carried out in every building of the great\ntimes which I had opportunity of examining.There are two distinct modes in which this adaptation is\neffected.In the first, the", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.In this method it is not always easy to distinguish\neconomy from skill, or slovenliness from science.But, in the second\nmethod, a different design is adopted, composed of fewer parts and of\nsimpler lines, and this is cut with exquisite precision.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.This is of\ncourse the higher method, and the more satisfactory proof of purpose;\nbut an equal degree of imperfection is found in both kinds when they are\nseen close; in the first, a bald execution of a perfect design; the\nsecond, a baldness of design with perfect execution.And in these very\nimperfections lies the admirableness of the ornament.It may be asked whether, in advocating this adaptation to the\ndistance of the eye, I obey my adopted rule of observance of natural\nlaw.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Are not all natural things, it may be asked, as lovely near as far\naway?Look at the clouds, and watch the delicate sculpture\nof their alabaster sides, and the rounded lustre of their magnificent\nrolling.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.They are meant to be beheld far away; they were shaped for\ntheir place, high above your head; approach them, and they fuse into\nvague mists, or whirl away in fierce fragments of thunderous vapor.Look\nat the crest of the Alp, from the far-away plains over which its light\nis cast, whence human souls have communion with it by their myriads.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.The\nchild looks up to it in the dawn, and the husbandman in the burden and\nheat of the day, and the old man in the going down of the sun, and it is\nto them all as the celestial city on the world's horizon; dyed with the\ndepth of heaven, and clothed with the calm of eternity.There was it\nset, for holy dominion, by Him who marked for the sun his journey, and\nbade the moon know her going down.It was built for its place in the\nfar-off sky; approach it, and as the sound of the voice of man dies away\nabout its foundations, and the tide of human life, shallowed upon the\nvast aerial shore, is at last met by the Eternal \"Here shall thy waves\nbe stayed,\" the glory of its aspect fades into blanched fearfulness; its\npurple walls are rent into grisly rocks, its silver fretwork saddened\ninto wasting snow, the storm-brands of ages are on its breast, the ashes\nof its own ruin lie solemnly on its white raiment.Nor in such instances as these alone, though strangely enough, the\ndiscrepancy between apparent and actual beauty is greater in proportion\nto the unapproachableness of the object, is the law observed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.For every\ndistance from the eye there is a peculiar kind of beauty, or a different\nsystem of lines of form; the sight of that beauty is reserved for that\ndistance, and for that alone.If you approach nearer, that kind of\nbeauty is lost, and another succeeds, to be disorganised and reduced to\nstrange and incomprehensible means and appliances in its turn.If you\ndesire to perceive the great harmonies of the form of a rocky mountain,\nyou must not ascend upon its sides.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.All is there disorder and accident,\nor seems so; sudden starts of its shattered beds hither and thither;\nugly struggles of unexpected strength from under the ground; fallen\nfragments, toppling one over another into more helpless fall.Retire\nfrom it, and, as your eye commands it more and more, as you see the\nruined mountain world with a wider glance, behold!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.dim sympathies begin\nto busy themselves in the disjointed mass; line binds itself into\nstealthy fellowship with line; group by group, the helpless fragments\ngather themselves into ordered companies; new captains of hosts and\nmasses of battalions become visible, one by one, and far away answers of\nfoot to foot, and of bone to bone, until the powerless chaos is seen\nrisen up with girded loins, and not one piece of all the unregarded heap\ncould now be spared from the mystic whole.Now it is indeed true that where nature loses one kind of\nbeauty, as you approach it, she substitutes another; this is worthy of\nher infinite power: and, as we shall see, art can sometimes follow her\neven in doing this; but all I insist upon at present is, that the\nseveral effects of nature are each worked with means referred to a\nparticular distance, and producing their effect at that distance only.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.Take a singular and marked instance: When the sun rises behind a ridge\nof pines, and those pines are seen from a distance of a mile or two,\nagainst his light, the whole form of the tree, trunk, branches, and all,\nbecomes one frostwork of intensely brilliant silver, which is relieved\nagainst the clear sky like a burning fringe, for some distance on either\nside of the sun.[71] Now suppose that a person who had never seen pines\nwere, for the first time in his life, to see them under this strange\naspect, and, reasoning as to the means by which such effect could be\nproduced, laboriously to approach the eastern ridge, how would he be\namazed to find that the fiery spectres had been produced by trees with\nswarthy and grey trunks, and dark green leaves!We, in our simplicity,\nif we had been required to produce such an appearance, should have built\nup trees of chased silver, with trunks of glass, and then been\ngrievously amazed to find that, at two miles off, neither silver nor\nglass were any more visible; but nature knew better, and prepared for\nher fairy work with the strong branches and dark leaves, in her own\nmysterious way.Now this is exactly what you have to do with your good ornament.It may be that it is capable of being approached, as well as likely to\nbe seen far away, and then it ought to have microscopic qualities, as\nthe pine leaves have, which will bear approach.But your calculation of\nits purpose is for a glory to be produced at a given distance; it may be\nhere, or may be there, but it is a _given_ distance; and the excellence\nof the ornament depends upon its fitting that distance, and being seen\nbetter there than anywhere else, and having a particular function and\nform which it can only discharge and assume there.You are never to say\nthat ornament has great merit because \"you cannot see the beauty of it\nhere;\" but, it has great merit because \"you _can_ see its beauty _here\nonly_.\"And to give it this merit is just about as difficult a task as I\ncould well set you.I have above noted the two ways in which it is done:\nthe one, being merely rough cutting, may be passed over; the other,\nwhich is scientific alteration of design, falls, itself, into two great\nbranches, Simplification and Emphasis.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.A word or two is necessary on each of these heads.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.When an ornamental work is intended to be seen near, if its\ncomposition be indeed fine, the subdued and delicate portions of the\ndesign lead to, and unite, the energetic parts, and those energetic\nparts form with the rest a whole, in which their own immediate relations\nto each other are not perceived.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Remove this design to a distance, and\nthe connecting delicacies vanish, the energies alone remain, now either\ndisconnected altogether, or assuming with each other new relations,\nwhich, not having been intended by the designer, will probably be\npainful.There is a like, and a more palpable, effect, in the retirement\nof a band of music in which the instruments are of very unequal powers;\nthe fluting and fifeing expire, the drumming remains, and that in a\npainful arrangement, as demanding something which is unheard.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.In like\nmanner, as the designer at arm's length removes or elevates his work,\nfine gradations, and roundings, and incidents, vanish, and a totally\nunexpected arrangement is established between the remainder of the\nmarkings, certainly confused, and in all probability painful.The art of architectural design is therefore, first, the\npreparation for this beforehand, the rejection of all the delicate\npassages as worse than useless, and the fixing the thought upon the\narrangement of the features which will remain visible far away.Nor does\nthis always imply a diminution of resource; for, while it may be assumed\nas a law that fine modulation of surface in light becomes quickly\ninvisible as the object retires, there are a softness and mystery given\nto the harder markings, which enable them to be safely used as media of\nexpression.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.There is an exquisite example of this use, in the head of\nthe Adam of the Ducal Palace.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.It is only at the height of 17 or 18 feet\nabove the eye; nevertheless, the sculptor felt it was no use to trouble\nhimself about drawing the corners of the mouth, or the lines of the\nlips, delicately, at that distance; his object has been to mark them\nclearly, and to prevent accidental shadows from concealing them, or\naltering their expression.The lips are cut thin and sharp, so that\ntheir line cannot be mistaken, and a good deep drill-hole struck into\nthe angle of the mouth; the eye is anxious and questioning, and one is\nsurprised, from below, to perceive a kind of darkness in the iris of it,\nneither like color, nor like a circular furrow.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.The expedient can only\nbe discovered by ascending to the level of the head; it is one which\nwould have been quite inadmissible except in distant work, six\ndrill-holes cut into the iris, round a central one for the pupil.By just calculation, like this, of the means at our disposal,\nby beautiful arrangement of the prominent features, and by choice of\ndifferent subjects for different places, choosing the broadest forms for\nthe farthest distance, it is possible to give the impression, not only\nof perfection, but of an exquisite delicacy, to the most distant\nornament.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.And this is the true sign of the right having been done, and\nthe utmost possible power attained:--The spectator should be satisfied\nto stay in his place, feeling the decoration, wherever it may be,\nequally rich, full, and lovely: not desiring to climb the steeples in\norder to examine it, but sure that he has it all, where he is.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the office.Perhaps\nthe capitals of the cathedral of Genoa are the best instances of\nabsolute perfection in this kind: seen from below, they appear as rich\nas the frosted silver of the Strada degli Orefici; and the nearer you\napproach them, the less delicate they seem.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.This is, however, not the only mode, though the best, in which\nornament is adapted for distance.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.The other is emphasis,--the unnatural\ninsisting upon explanatory lines, where the subject would otherwise\nbecome unintelligible.It is to be remembered that, by a deep and narrow\nincision, an architect has the power, at least in sunshine, of drawing a\nblack line on stone, just as vigorously as it can be drawn with chalk on\ngrey paper; and that he may thus, wherever and in the degree that he\nchooses, substitute _chalk sketching_ for sculpture.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.They are curiously\nmingled by the Romans.The bas-reliefs of the Arc d'Orange are small,\nand would be confused, though in bold relief, if they depended for\nintelligibility on the relief only; but each figure is outlined by a\nstrong _incision_ at its edge into the background, and all the ornaments\non the armor are simply drawn with incised lines, and not cut out at\nall.A similar use of lines is made by the Gothic nations in all their\nearly sculpture, and with delicious effect.Now, to draw a mere\npattern--as, for instance, the bearings of a shield--with these simple\nincisions, would, I suppose, occupy an able sculptor twenty minutes or\nhalf an hour; and the pattern is then clearly seen, under all\ncircumstances of light and shade; there can be no mistake about it, and\nno missing it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.To carve out the bearings in due and finished relief\nwould occupy a long summer's day, and the results would be feeble and\nindecipherable in the best lights, and in some lights totally and\nhopelessly invisible, ignored, non-existant.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Now the Renaissance\narchitects, and our modern ones, despise the simple expedient of the\nrough Roman or barbarian.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.They care\nonly to speak finely, and be thought great orators, if one could only\nhear them.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.So I leave you to choose between the old men, who took\nminutes to tell things plainly, and the modern men, who take days to\ntell them unintelligibly.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.All expedients of this kind, both of simplification and energy,\nfor the expression of details at a distance where their actual forms\nwould have been invisible, but more especially this linear method, I\nshall call Proutism; for the greatest master of the art in modern times\nhas been Samuel Prout.He actually takes up buildings of the later times\nin which the ornament has been too refined for its place, and\ntranslates it into the energised linear ornament of earlier art: and to\nthis power of taking the life and essence of decoration, and putting it\ninto a perfectly intelligible form, when its own fulness would have been\nconfused, is owing the especial power of his drawings.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Nothing can be\nmore closely analogous than the method with which an old Lombard uses\nhis chisel, and that with which Prout uses the reed-pen; and we shall\nsee presently farther correspondence in their feeling about the\nenrichment of luminous surfaces.Now, all that has been hitherto said refers to ornament whose\ndistance is fixed, or nearly so; as when it is at any considerable\nheight from the ground, supposing the spectator to desire to see it, and\nto get as near it as he can.But the distance of ornament is never fixed\nto the _general_ spectator.The tower of a cathedral is bound to look\nwell, ten miles off, or five miles, or half a mile, or within fifty\nyards.The ornaments of its top have fixed distances, compared with\nthose of its base; but quite unfixed distances in their relation to the\ngreat world: and the ornaments of the base have no fixed distance at\nall.They are bound to look well from the other side of the cathedral\nclose, and to look equally well, or better, as we enter the cathedral\ndoor.XVII., that for\nevery distance from the eye there was a different system of form in all\nnatural objects: this is to be so then in architecture.The lesser\nornament is to be grafted on the greater, and third or fourth orders of\nornaments upon this again, as need may be, until we reach the limits of\npossible sight; each order of ornament being adapted for a different\ndistance: first, for example, the great masses,--the buttresses and\nstories and black windows and broad cornices of the tower, which give it\nmake, and organism, as it rises over the horizon, half a score of miles\naway: then the traceries and shafts and pinnacles, which give it\nrichness as we approach: then the niches and statues and knobs and\nflowers, which we can only see when we stand beneath it.At this third\norder of ornament, we may pause, in the upper portions; but on the\nroofs of the niches, and the robes of the statues, and the rolls of the\nmouldings, comes a fourth order of ornament,", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "All good ornamentation is thus arborescent, as it were,\none class of it branching out of another and sustained by it; and its\nnobility consists in this, that whatever order or class of it we may be\ncontemplating, we shall find it subordinated to a greater, simpler, and\nmore powerful; and if we then contemplate the greater order, we shall\nfind it again subordinated to a greater still; until the greatest can\nonly be quite grasped by retiring to the limits of distance commanding\nit.And if this subordination be not complete, the ornament is bad: if the\nfigurings and chasings and borderings of a dress be not subordinated to\nthe folds of it,--if the folds are not subordinate to the action and\nmass of the figure,--if this action and mass not to the divisions of the\nrecesses and shafts among which it stands,--if these not to the shadows\nof the great arches and buttresses of the whole building, in each case\nthere is error; much more if all be contending with each other and\nstriving for attention at the same time.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.It is nevertheless evident, that, however perfect this\ndistribution, there cannot be orders adapted to _every_ distance of the\nspectator.Between the ranks of ornament there must always be a bold\nseparation; and there must be many intermediate distances, where we are\ntoo far off to see the lesser rank clearly, and yet too near to grasp\nthe next higher rank wholly: and at all these distances the spectator\nwill feel himself ill-placed, and will desire to go nearer or farther\naway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.This must be the case in all noble work, natural or artificial.It\nis exactly the same with respect to Rouen cathedral or the Mont Blanc.We like to see them from the other side of the Seine, or of the lake of\nGeneva; from the Marche aux Fleurs, or the Valley of Chamouni; from the\nparapets of the apse, or the crags of the Montagne de la Cote: but there\nare intermediate distances which dissatisfy us in either case, and from\nwhich one is in haste either to advance or to retire.Directly opposed to this ordered, disciplined, well officered\nand variously ranked ornament, this type of divine, and therefore of all\ngood human government, is the democratic ornament, in which all is\nequally influential, and has equal office and authority; that is to say,\nnone of it any office nor authority, but a life of continual struggle\nfor independence and notoriety, or of gambling for chance regards.The\nEnglish perpendicular work is by far the worst of this kind that I know;\nits main idea, or decimal fraction of an idea, being to cover its walls\nwith dull, successive, eternity of reticulation, to fill with equal\nfoils the equal interstices between the equal bars, and charge the\ninterminable blanks with statues and rosettes, invisible at a distance,\nand uninteresting near.The early Lombardic, Veronese, and Norman work is the exact reverse of\nthis; being divided first into large masses, and these masses covered\nwith minute chasing and surface work, which fill them with interest, and\nyet do not disturb nor divide their greatness.The lights are kept broad\nand bright, and yet are found on near approach to be charged with\nintricate design.This, again, is a part of the great system of\ntreatment which I shall hereafter call \"Proutism;\" much of what is\nthought mannerism and imperfection in Prout's work, being the result of\nhis determined resolution that minor details shall never break up his\nlarge masses of light.Such are the main principles to be observed in the adaptation of\nornament to the sight.We have lastly to inquire by what method, and in\nwhat quantities, the ornament, thus adapted to mental contemplation, and\nprepared for its physical position, may most wisely be arranged.I think\nthe method ought first to be considered, and the quantity last; for the\nadvisable quantity depends upon the method.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.It was said above, that the proper treatment or arrangement of\nornament was that which expressed the laws and ways of Deity.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.Now, the\nsubordination of visible orders to each other, just noted, is one\nexpression of these.But there may also--must also--be a subordination\nand obedience of the parts of each order to some visible law, out of\nitself, but having reference to itself only (not to any upper order):\nsome law which shall not oppress, but guide, limit, and sustain.In the tenth chapter of the second volume of \"Modern Painters,\" the\nreader will find that I traced one part of the beauty of God's creation\nto the expression of a _self_-restrained liberty: that is to say, the\nimage of that perfection of _divine_ action, which, though free to work\nin arbitrary methods, works always in consistent methods, called by us\nLaws.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bedroom.Now, correspondingly, we find that when these natural objects are to\nbecome subjects of the art of man, their perfect treatment is an image\nof the perfection of _human_ action: a voluntary submission to divine\nlaw.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the milk.It was suggested to me but lately by the friend to whose originality of\nthought I have before expressed my obligations, Mr.Newton, that the\nGreek pediment, with its enclosed sculptures, represented to the Greek\nmind the law of Fate, confining human action within limits not to be\noverpassed.I do not believe the Greeks ever distinctly thought of this;\nbut the instinct of all the human race, since the world began, agrees in\nsome expression of such limitation as one of the first necessities of\ngood ornament.[72] And this expression is heightened, rather than\ndiminished, when some portion of the design slightly breaks the law to\nwhich the rest is subjected; it is like expressing the use of miracles\nin the divine government; or, perhaps, in slighter degrees, the relaxing\nof a law, generally imperative, in compliance with some more imperative\nneed--the hungering of David.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.How eagerly this special infringement of a\ngeneral law was sometimes sought by the mediaeval workmen, I shall be\nfrequently able to point out to the reader; but I remember just now a\nmost curious instance, in an archivolt of a house in the Corte del Remer\nclose to the Rialto at Venice.It is composed of a wreath of\nflower-work--a constant Byzantine design--with an animal in each coil;\nthe whole enclosed between two fillets.Each animal, leaping or eating,\nscratching or biting, is kept nevertheless strictly within its coil, and\nbetween the fillets.Not the shake of an ear, not the tip of a tail,\noverpasses this appointed line, through a series of some five-and-twenty\nor thirty animals; until, on a sudden, and by mutual consent, two little\nbeasts (not looking, for the rest, more rampant than the others), one on\neach side, lay their small paws across the enclosing fillet at exactly\nthe same point of its course, and thus break the continuity of its line.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.Two ears of corn, or leaves, do the same thing in the mouldings round\nthe northern door of the Baptistery at Florence.Observe, however, and this is of the utmost possible\nimportance, that the value of this type does not consist in the mere\nshutting of the ornament into a certain space, but in the acknowledgment\n_by_ the ornament of the fitness of the limitation--of its own perfect\nwillingness to submit to it; nay, of a predisposition in itself to fall\ninto the ordained form, without any direct expression of the command to\ndo so; an anticipation of the authority, and an instant and willing\nsubmission to it, in every fibre and spray: not merely _willing_, but\n_happy_ submission, as being pleased rather than vexed to have so\nbeautiful a law suggested to it, and one which to follow is so justly in\naccordance with its own nature.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.You must not cut out a branch of\nhawthorn as it grows, and rule a triangle round it, and suppose that it\nis then submitted to law.It is only put in a cage, and\nwill look as if it must get out, for its life, or wither in the\nconfinement.But the spirit of triangle must be put into the hawthorn.It must suck in isoscelesism with its sap.Thorn and blossom, leaf and\nspray, must grow with an awful sense of triangular necessity upon them,\nfor the guidance of which they are to be thankful, and to grow all the\nstronger and more gloriously.And though there may be a transgression\nhere and there, and an adaptation to some other need, or a reaching\nforth to some other end greater even than the triangle, yet this liberty\nis to be always accepted under a solemn sense of special permission; and\nwhen the full form is reached and the entire submission expressed, and\nevery blossom has a thrilling sense of its responsibility down into its\ntiniest stamen, you may take your terminal line away if you will.The commandment is written on the heart of the\nthing.Then, besides this obedience to external law, there is the\nobedience to internal headship, which constitutes the unity of ornament,\nof which I think enough has been said for my present purpose in the\nchapter on Unity in the second vol.But I hardly\nknow whether to arrange as an expression of a divine law, or a\nrepresentation of a physical fact, the alternation of shade with light\nwhich, in equal succession, forms one of the chief elements of\n_continuous_ ornament, and in some peculiar ones, such as dentils and\nbillet mouldings, is the source of their only charm.The opposition of\ngood and evil, the antagonism of the entire human system (so ably worked\nout by Lord Lindsay), the alternation of labor with rest, the mingling\nof life with death, or the actual physical fact of the division of light\nfrom darkness, and of the falling and rising of night and day, are all\ntypified or represented by these chains of shade and light of which the\neye never wearies, though their true meaning may never occur to the\nthoughts.The next question respecting the arrangement of ornament is\none closely connected also with its quantity.The system of creation is\none in which \"God's creatures leap not, but express a feast, where all the\nguests sit close, and nothing wants.\"It is also a feast, where there is\nnothing redundant.So, then, in distributing our ornament, there must\nnever be any sense of gap or blank, neither any sense of there being a\nsingle member, or fragment of a member, which could be spared.Whatever\nhas nothing to do, whatever could go without being missed, is not\nornament; it is deformity and encumbrance.And, on the\nother hand, care must be taken either to diffuse the ornament which we\npermit, in due relation over the whole building, or so to concentrate\nit, as never to leave a sense of its having got into knots, and curdled\nupon some points, and left the rest of the building whey.It is very\ndifficult to give the rules, or analyse the feelings, which should\ndirect us in this matter: for some shafts may be carved and others left\nunfinished, and that with advantage; some windows may be jewelled like\nAladdin's, and one left plain, and still with advantage; the door or\ndoors, or a single turret, or the whole western facade of a church, or\nthe apse or transept, may be made special subjects of decoration, and\nthe rest left plain, and still sometimes with advantage.But in all such\ncases there is either sign of that feeling which I advocated in the\nFirst Chapter of the \"Seven Lamps,\" the desire of rather doing some\nportion of the building as we would have it, and leaving the rest plain,\nthan doing the whole imperfectly; or else there is choice made of some\nimportant feature, to which, as more honorable than the rest, the\ndecoration is confined.The evil is when, without system, and without\npreference of the nobler members, the ornament alternates between sickly\nluxuriance and sudden blankness.But it was not\ntill 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural\nHistory, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out\nthe peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the\nMuseum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves\nnothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of\nVerreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose\ntail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that\nthe museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an\nordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named\n_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of\nthe family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat\nhas given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common\nArgus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not\nformed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very\nlong feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists\nof twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with\nocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is\nadorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its\nsystem of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its\nbody are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,\nthen, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,\nin the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,\nafter a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name\n_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for\nthat of _Rheinardi_.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which\nbelong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be\nlarger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft\non the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest\n0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.The feathers of this crest are\nbrown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy\nfeathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck\nwith piliform feathers of a ruddy brown.The upper part of the body is\nof a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole\ndotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are\nfound on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become\nelongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite\nregularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail\nand on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous\nblotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface\nof the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,\nare disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.This\nsimilitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the\ndistinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many\nother Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are\nconsiderably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,\nall spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length\nfrom the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of\ninsertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to\na sharp point.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and\nwidth which the bird holds slightly<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.", "question": "Where is the milk?

nevertheless,\nto that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but\ndistinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous\nradiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the\nlarch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow\ncolor before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but\ngenerally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we\nbelieve, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other\ntrees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies\nfortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,\nit is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or\nother unexplored districts, into China and Japan.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Though now a solitary\nrepresentative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the\ncoal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,\nProfessor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty\nspecies and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through\nthe northern hemisphere.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least\ncertain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it\nbe the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and\ndescribed by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as\nto the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.The\nFrenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English\nnurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese\nseeds.The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too\nwell.He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and\nsold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas.Next\nmorning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to\nregain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had\ngiven for all five, but without avail.The plants were conveyed to\nFrance, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree\ngot the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_.This is the story as given by\nLoudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his\nlectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the\nperfidy of Albion is not stated.The tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on\nanother.All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated\nfrom a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured\ngrafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent.Nevertheless, the\nfemale tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is\nquite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only\nmay sometimes bear female flowers only.We have no certain evidence of\nthis in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in\nother dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near\nPhiladelphia, as recently recorded by Mr.Meehan, may possibly be\nattributed to this cause.The tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and\nis about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth\nat 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases.In 1837\na tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height.Loudon\nhimself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female\nbranch was grafted.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.It is to be feared that this specimen has long since\nperished.We have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is\nallied to the larch.It presents another point of resemblance both to\nthe larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and\nmale catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with\nlong extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation\nbetween the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of\ntheir production is not understood, though in all probability a little\nobservation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.The fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,\ngreatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.Whether the albumen contains the peculiar \"corpuscles\" common to Cycads\nand Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2\nto 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the\ncase.The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the\nproof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,\nsuch as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar\nvenation of the Gingkgo.Conifers are in some degree links between\nordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to\nconnect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.In germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within\nthe shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young\nstem bears its leaves in threes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.We have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of\nthis tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest\nconsists.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with\nleaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and\nothers with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOODS OF AMERICA.A collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being\nprepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of\nNatural History.Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in\nCentral Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,\nsome inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn\nlongitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally.These logs represent all\nbut 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and\nnearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value.The 26\nvarieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter\nsets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from\nthe groves of California.S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are\nengaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition.The logs as they\nreach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this\nmethod being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and\ndelicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in\nprocess of transportation from various parts of the country to this\ncity.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect\nspecimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in\nmaking the collection.With the specimens of the trees come to the\nmuseum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the\ntree.These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north\nto Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the\nwest--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a\nrepresentative in this collection of logs.On arrival here the logs are\ngreen, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival\nis to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from\n\"checking,\" as it is technically called, or \"season cracking,\" as the\nunscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during\nthe seasoning process.As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons\nmuch more quickly than does the heart of the wood.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.The prevention of\nthis splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for\nexhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for\nexhibition is gone.A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens\nis now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.Into the base of the log and\nalongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger.As the wood\nseasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many\ninstances doubtless saved valuable specimens.One of the finest in the\ncollection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,\nhas been ruined by the seasoning process.On one side there is a huge\ncrack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as\nthough some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and\nhad made a poor job of it.The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the\npersimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.It also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to\nimpossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic\nof the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.Before the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at\nall obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with\na regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.There is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree\nduring each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly\nmarked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric\ncircles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows\nolder.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the\ncollection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.It is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which\nthis wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the \"Pride of India.\"The heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it\nand the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.On the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an\nabnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is\none and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts\nwho have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded.The diagrams\nreferred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of\nexhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.After a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center\ndown about one-third of its length.A transverse cut is then made and\nthe semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed.When a log is thus treated the inspector can\nsee the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did\nwhen growing in the forest.The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood\nand to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and\ncarefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled\nsections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen.That these may\nbe made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half\nof this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half\nleft in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is\nentirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected\nby Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds\nof trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually\nneglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental\nwood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of\ncomparatively little value.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared\nfor exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a\nspecimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches\nin length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The\nspecimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might\nbe transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of\na box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city\nwithout change.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a\nportion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The\ntrunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of\ntreatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an\nirregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves\nspringing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated\ntrees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,\nand though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang\nout, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was\nsupposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when\nthe workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new\nlife, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the\notherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again\nbefore the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the\nDouglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided\ncuriosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,\ntwo inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to\nthe-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,\nwhich have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes\nin the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest\nspecimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a\nspecies of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable\nelevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the\nconcentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles\nthe black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain\ngrowths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the\nIndians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its\nage to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of\nthe white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The\nnext largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,\nvariously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,\nwhich is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of\nthe redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from\nthe Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet\nin diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.", "question": "Where is the apple?

but the instinct of discipline, joined to their\npersuasion that the authority of their officer, so boldly exerted, must\nbe supported by some forces without the gate, induced them to submit.\"Take away those arms,\" said Lord Evandale to the people of the Castle;\n\"they shall not be restored until these men know better the use for which\nthey are intrusted with them.--And now,\" he continued, addressing the\nmutineers, \"begone!--Make the best use of your time, and of a truce of\nthree hours, which the enemy are contented to allow you.Take the road to\nEdinburgh, and meet me at the House-of-Muir.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.I need not bid you beware of\ncommitting violence by the way; you will not, in your present condition,\nprovoke resentment for your own sakes.Let your punctuality show that you\nmean to atone for this morning's business.\"The disarmed soldiers shrunk in silence from the presence of their\nofficer, and, leaving the Castle, took the road to the place of\nrendezvous, making such haste as was inspired by the fear of meeting with\nsome detached party of the insurgents, whom their present defenceless\ncondition, and their former violence, might inspire with thoughts of\nrevenge.Inglis, whom Evandale destined for punishment, remained in\ncustody.Halliday was praised for his conduct, and assured of succeeding\nto the rank of the culprit.These arrangements being hastily made, Lord\nEvandale accosted the Major, before whose eyes the scene had seemed to\npass like the change of a dream.\"My dear Major, we must give up the place.\"\"I was in hopes you had brought\nreinforcements and supplies.\"\"Not a man--not a pound of meal,\" answered Lord Evandale.\"Yet I am blithe to see you,\" returned the honest Major; \"we were\ninformed yesterday that these psalm-singing rascals had a plot on your\nlife, and I had mustered the scoundrelly dragoons ten minutes ago in\norder to beat up Burley's quarters and get you out of limbo, when the dog\nInglis, instead of obeying me, broke out into open mutiny.--But what is\nto be done now?\"\"I have, myself, no choice,\" said Lord Evandale; \"I am a prisoner,\nreleased on parole, and bound for Edinburgh.You and the ladies must take\nthe same route.I have, by the favour of a friend, a safe conduct and\nhorses for you and your retinue--for God's sake make haste--you cannot\npropose to hold out with seven or eight men, and without provisions--\nEnough has been done for honour, and enough to render the defence of the\nhighest consequence to government.More were needless, as well as\ndesperate.The English troops are arrived at Edinburgh, and will speedily\nmove upon Hamilton.The possession of Tillietudlem by the rebels will be\nbut temporary.\"\"If you think so, my lord,\" said the veteran, with a reluctant sigh,--\"I\nknow you only advise what is honourable--if, then, you really think the\ncase inevitable, I must submit; for the mutiny of these scoundrels would\nrender it impossible to man the walls.--Gudyill, let the women call up\ntheir mistresses, and all be ready to march--But if I could believe that\nmy remaining in these old walls, till I was starved to a mummy, could do\nthe King's cause the least service, old Miles Bellenden would not leave\nthem while there was a spark of life in his body!\"The ladies, already alarmed by the mutiny, now heard the determination of\nthe Major, in which they readily acquiesced, though not without some\ngroans and sighs on the part of Lady Margaret, which referred, as usual,\nto the _dejeune_; of his Most Sacred Majesty in the halls which were now\nto be abandoned to rebels.Hasty preparations were made for evacuating\nthe Castle; and long ere the dawn was distinct enough for discovering\nobjects with precision, the ladies, with Major Bellenden, Harrison,\nGudyill, and the other domestics, were mounted on the led horses, and\nothers which had been provided in the neighbourhood, and proceeded\ntowards the north, still escorted by four of the insurgent horsemen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.The\nrest of the party who had accompanied Lord Evandale from the hamlet, took\npossession of the deserted Castle, carefully forbearing all outrage or\nacts of plunder.And when the sun arose, the scarlet and blue colours of\nthe Scottish Covenant floated from the Keep of Tillietudlem.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.And, to my breast, a bodkin in her hand\n               Were worth a thousand daggers.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.The cavalcade which left the Castle of Tillietudlem, halted for a few\nminutes at the small town of Bothwell, after passing the outposts of the\ninsurgents, to take some slight refreshments which their attendants had\nprovided, and which were really necessary to persons who had suffered\nconsiderably by want of proper nourishment.They then pressed forward\nupon the road towards Edinburgh, amid the lights of dawn which were now\nrising on the horizon.It might have been expected, during the course of\nthe journey, that Lord Evandale would have been frequently by the side of\nMiss Edith Bellenden.Yet, after his first salutations had been\nexchanged, and every precaution solicitously adopted which could serve\nfor her accommodation, he rode in the van of the party with Major\nBellenden, and seemed to abandon the charge of immediate attendance upon\nhis lovely niece to one of the insurgent cavaliers, whose dark military\ncloak, with the large flapped hat and feather, which drooped over his\nface, concealed at once his figure and his features.They rode side by\nside in silence for more than two miles, when the stranger addressed Miss\nBellenden in a tremulous and suppressed voice.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football there.\"Miss Bellenden,\" he said, \"must have friends wherever she is known; even\namong those whose conduct she now disapproves.Is there any thing that\nsuch can do to show their respect for her, and their regret for her\nsufferings?\"\"Let them learn for their own sakes,\" replied Edith, \"to venerate the\nlaws, and to spare innocent blood.Let them return to their allegiance,\nand I can forgive them all that I have suffered, were it ten times more.\"\"You think it impossible, then,\" rejoined the cavalier, \"for any one to\nserve in our ranks, having the weal of his country sincerely at heart,\nand conceiving himself in the discharge of a patriotic duty?\"\"It might be imprudent, while so absolutely in your power,\" replied Miss\nBellenden, \"to answer that question.\"\"Not in the present instance, I plight you the word of a soldier,\"\nreplied the horseman.\"I have been taught candour from my birth,\" said Edith; \"and, if I am to\nspeak at all, I must utter my real sentiments.God only can judge the\nheart--men must estimate intentions by actions.Treason, murder by the\nsword and by gibbet, the oppression of a private family such as ours, who\nwere only in arms for the defence of the established government, and of\nour own property, are actions which must needs sully all that have\naccession to them, by whatever specious terms they may be gilded over.\"\"The guilt of civil war,\" rejoined the horseman--\"the miseries which it\nbrings in its train, lie at the door of those who provoked it by illegal\noppression, rather than of such as are driven to arms in order to assert\ntheir natural rights as freemen.\"\"That is assuming the question,\" replied Edith, \"which ought to be\nproved.Each party contends that they are right in point of principle,\nand therefore the guilt must lie with them who first drew the sword; as,\nin an affray, law holds those to be the criminals who are the first to\nhave recourse to violence.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.said the horseman, \"were our vindication to rest there, how easy\nwould it be to show that we have suffered with a patience which almost\nseemed beyond the power of humanity, ere we were driven by oppression\ninto open resistance!--But I perceive,\" he continued, sighing deeply,\n\"that it is vain to plead before Miss Bellenden a cause which she has\nalready prejudged, perhaps as much from her dislike of the persons as of\nthe principles of those engaged in it.\"\"Pardon me,\" answered Edith; \"I have stated with freedom my opinion\nof the principles of the insurgents; of their persons I know\nnothing--excepting in one solitary instance.\"\"And that instance,\" said the horseman, \"has influenced your opinion of\nthe whole body?\"\"Far from it,\" said Edith; \"he is--at least I once thought him--one in\nwhose scale few were fit to be weighed--he is--or he seemed--one of early\ntalent, high faith, pure morality, and warm affections.Can I approve of\na rebellion which has made such a man, formed to ornament, to enlighten,\nand to defend his country, the companion of gloomy and ignorant fanatics,\nor canting hypocrites,--the leader of brutal clowns,--the brother-in-arms\nto banditti and highway murderers?--Should you meet such an one in your\ncamp, tell him that Edith Bellenden has wept more over his fallen\ncharacter, blighted prospects, and dishonoured name, than over the\ndistresses of her own house,--and that she has better endured that famine\nwhich has wasted her cheek and dimmed her eye, than the pang of heart\nwhich attended the reflection by and through whom these calamities were\ninflicted.\"As she thus spoke, she turned upon her companion a countenance, whose\nfaded cheek attested the reality of her sufferings, even while it glowed\nwith the temporary animation which accompanied her language.The horseman\nwas not insensible to the appeal; he raised his hand to his brow with the\nsudden motion of one who feels a pang shoot along his brain, passed it\nhastily over his face, and then pulled the shadowing hat still deeper on\nhis forehead.The movement, and the feelings which it excited, did not\nescape Edith, nor did she remark them without emotion.\"And yet,\" she said, \"should the person of whom I speak seem to you too\ndeeply affected by the hard opinion of--of--an early friend, say to him,\nthat sincere repentance is next to innocence;--that, though fallen from a\nheight not easily recovered, and", "question": "Where is the football?

\"and I scarce can speak on\nthe subject without presumption.But, since I have gone so far, I will\nfairly add, I would wish to see a peace which should give rest to all\nparties, and secure the subjects from military rapine, which I detest as\nmuch as I do the means now adopted to resist it.\"\"Miss Bellenden,\" answered Henry Morton, raising his face, and speaking\nin his natural tone, \"the person who has lost such a highly-valued place\nin your esteem, has yet too much spirit to plead his cause as a criminal;\nand, conscious that he can no longer claim a friend's interest in your\nbosom, he would be silent under your hard censure, were it not that he\ncan refer to the honoured testimony of Lord Evandale, that his earnest\nwishes and most active exertions are, even now, directed to the\naccomplishment of such a peace as the most loyal cannot censure.\"He bowed with dignity to Miss Bellenden, who, though her language\nintimated that she well knew to whom she had been speaking, probably had\nnot expected that he would justify himself with so much animation.She\nreturned his salute, confused and in silence.Morton then rode forward to\nthe head of the party.exclaimed Major Bellenden, surprised at the sudden\napparition.\"The same,\" answered Morton; \"who is sorry that he labours under the\nharsh construction of Major Bellenden and his family.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.He commits to my\nLord Evandale,\" he continued, turning towards the young nobleman, and\nbowing to him, \"the charge of undeceiving his friends, both regarding the\nparticulars of his conduct and the purity of his motives.Farewell, Major\nBellenden--All happiness attend you and yours--May we meet again in\nhappier and better times!\"\"Believe me,\" said Lord Evandale, \"your confidence, Mr Morton, is not\nmisplaced; I will endeavour to repay the great services I have received\nfrom you by doing my best to place your character on its proper footing\nwith Major Bellenden, and all whose esteem you value.\"\"I expected no less from your generosity, my lord,\" said Morton.He then called his followers, and rode off along the heath in the\ndirection of Hamilton, their feathers waving and their steel caps\nglancing in the beams of the rising sun.Cuddie Headrigg alone remained\nan instant behind his companions to take an affectionate farewell of\nJenny Dennison, who had contrived, during this short morning's ride, to\nre-establish her influence over his susceptible bosom.A straggling tree\nor two obscured, rather than concealed, their _tete-a-tete_, as they\nhalted their horses to bid adieu.\"Fare ye weel, Jenny,\" said Cuddie, with a loud exertion of his lungs,\nintended perhaps to be a sigh, but rather resembling the intonation of a\ngroan,--\"Ye'll think o' puir Cuddie sometimes--an honest lad that lo'es\nye, Jenny; ye'll think o' him now and then?\"\"Whiles--at brose-time,\" answered the malicious damsel, unable either to\nsuppress the repartee, or the arch smile which attended it.[Illustration: Whiles--at Brose-Time--pa098]\n\n\nCuddie took his revenge as rustic lovers are wont, and as Jenny probably\nexpected,--caught his mistress round the neck, kissed her cheeks and lips\nheartily, and then turned his horse and trotted after his master.\"Deil's in the fallow,\" said Jenny, wiping her lips and adjusting her\nhead-dress, \"he has twice the spunk o' Tam Halliday, after a'.--Coming,\nmy leddy, coming--Lord have a care o' us, I trust the auld leddy didna\nsee us!\"\"Jenny,\" said Lady Margaret, as the damsel came up, \"was not that young\nman who commanded the party the same that was captain of the popinjay,\nand who was afterwards prisoner at Tillietudlem on the morning\nClaverhouse came there?\"Jenny, happy that the query had no reference to her own little matters,\nlooked at her young mistress, to discover, if possible, whether it was\nher cue to speak truth or not.Not being able to catch any hint to guide\nher, she followed her instinct as a lady's maid, and lied.\"I dinna believe it was him, my leddy,\" said Jenny, as confidently as if\nshe had been saying her catechism; \"he was a little black man, that.\"\"You must have been blind, Jenny,\" said the Major: \"Henry Morton is tall\nand fair, and that youth is the very man.\"\"I had ither thing ado than be looking at him,\" said Jenny, tossing her\nhead; \"he may be as fair as a farthing candle, for me.\"\"Is it not,\" said Lady Margaret, \"a blessed escape which we have made,\nout of the hands of so desperate and bloodthirsty a fanatic?\"\"You are deceived, madam,\" said Lord Evandale; \"Mr Morton merits such a\ntitle from no one, but least from us.That I am now alive, and that you\nare now on your safe retreat to your friends, instead of being prisoners\nto a real fanatical homicide, is solely and entirely owing to the prompt,\nactive, and energetic humanity of this young gentleman.\"He then went into a particular narrative of the events with which the\nreader is acquainted, dwelling upon the merits of Morton, and expatiating\non the risk at which he had rendered them these important services, as if\nhe had been a brother instead of a rival.\"I were worse than ungrateful,\" he said, \"were I silent on the merits of\nthe man who has twice saved my life.\"\"I would willingly think well of Henry Morton, my lord,\" replied Major\nBellenden; \"and I own he has behaved handsomely to your lordship and to\nus; but I cannot have the same allowances which it pleases your lordship\nto entertain for his present courses.\"\"You are to consider,\" replied Lord Evandale, \"that he has been partly\nforced upon them by necessity; and I must add, that his principles,\nthough differing in some degree from my own, are such as ought to command\nrespect.Claverhouse, whose knowledge of men is not to be disputed, spoke\njustly of him as to his extraordinary qualities, but with prejudice, and\nharshly, concerning his principles and motives.\"\"You have not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities, my\nlord,\" answered Major Bellenden.\"I, who have known him from boyhood,\ncould, before this affair, have said much of his good principles and\ngood-nature; but as to his high talents\"--\n\n\"They were probably hidden, Major,\" replied the generous Lord Evandale,\n\"even from himself, until circumstances called them forth; and, if I have\ndetected them, it was only because our intercourse and conversation\nturned on momentous and important subjects.He is now labouring to bring\nthis rebellion to an end, and the terms he has proposed are so moderate,\nthat they shall not want my hearty recommendation.\"\"And have you hopes,\" said Lady Margaret, \"to accomplish a scheme so\ncomprehensive?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.\"I should have, madam, were every whig as moderate as Morton, and every\nloyalist as disinterested as Major Bellenden.But such is the fanaticism\nand violent irritation of both parties, that I fear nothing will end this\ncivil war save the edge of the sword.\"It may be readily supposed, that Edith listened with the deepest interest\nto this conversation.While she regretted that she had expressed herself\nharshly and hastily to her lover, she felt a conscious and proud\nsatisfaction that his character was, even in the judgment of his\nnoble-minded rival, such as her own affection had once spoke it.\"Civil feuds and domestic prejudices,\" she said, \"may render it necessary\nfor me to tear his remembrance from my heart; but it is not small relief\nto know assuredly, that it is worthy of the place it has so long retained\nthere.\"While Edith was thus retracting her unjust resentment, her lover arrived\nat the camp of the insurgents, near Hamilton, which he found in\nconsiderable confusion.Certain advices had arrived that the royal army,\nhaving been recruited from England by a large detachment of the King's\nGuards, were about to take the field.Fame magnified their numbers and\ntheir high state of equipment and discipline, and spread abroad other\ncircumstances, which dismayed the courage of the insurgents.What favour\nthey might have expected from Monmouth, was likely to be intercepted by\nthe influence of those associated with him in command.His\nlieutenant-general was the celebrated General Thomas Dalzell, who, having\npractised the art of war in the then barbarous country of Russia, was as\nmuch feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human\nsufferings, as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour.This man was second in command to Monmouth, and the horse were commanded\nby Claverhouse, burning with desire to revenge the death of his nephew,\nand his defeat at Drumclog.To these accounts was added the most\nformidable and terrific description of the train of artillery and the\ncavalry force with which the royal army took the field.[Note:  Royal Army at Bothwell Bridge.A Cameronian muse was\n     awakened from slumber on this doleful occasion, and gave the\n     following account of the muster of the royal forces, in poetry\n     nearly as melancholy as the subject:--\n\n                    They marched east through Lithgow-town\n                    For to enlarge their forces;\n                    And sent for all the north-country\n                    To come, both foot and horses.Montrose did come and Athole both,\n                    And with them many more;\n                    And all the Highland Amorites\n                    That had been there before.The Lowdien Mallisha--Lothian Militia they\n                    Came with their coats of blew;\n                    Five hundred men from London came,\n                    Claid in a reddish hue.When they were assembled one and all,\n                    A full brigade were they;\n                    Like to a pack of hellish hounds,\n                    Roreing after their prey.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.When they were all provided well,\n                    In armour and amonition,\n                    Then thither wester did they come,\n                    Most cruel of intention.The royalists celebrated their victory in stanzas of equal merit.Specimens of both may be found in the curious collection of Fugitive\n     Scottish Poetry, principally of the Seventeenth Century, printed for\n     the Messrs Laing, Edinburgh.]Large bodies, composed of the Highland clans, having in language,\nreligion, and manners, no connexion with the insurgents, had been\nsummoned to join the royal army under their various chieftains; and these\nAmorites, or Philistines, as the insurgents termed them, came like eagles\nto the slaughter.In fact, every person who could ride or run at the\nKing's command, was summoned to arms, apparently with the purpose of\nforfeiting and fining such men of property whom their principles might\ndeter from joining the royal standard, though prudence prevented them\nfrom joining that of the insurgent Presbyterians.In short, everyrumour\ntended to increase the apprehension among the insurgents, that the King's\nvengeance had only been delayed in order that it might fall more certain\nand more heavy.Morton endeavoured to fortify the minds of the common people by pointing\nout the probable exaggeration of these reports, and by reminding them of\nthe strength of their own situation, with an unfordable river in front,\nonly passable by a long and narrow bridge.He called to their remembrance\ntheir victory over Claverhouse when their numbers were few, and then much\nworse disciplined and appointed for battle than now; showed them that the\nground on which they lay afforded, by its undulation, and the thickets\nwhich intersected it, considerable protection against artillery, and even\nagainst cavalry, if stoutly defended; and that their safety, in fact,\ndepended on their own spirit and resolution.But while Morton thus endeavoured to keep up the courage of the army at\nlarge, he availed himself of those discouraging rumours to endeavour to\nimpress on the minds of the leaders the necessity of proposing to the\ngovernment moderate terms of accommodation, while they were still\nformidable as commanding an unbroken and numerous army.He pointed out to\nthem, that, in the present humour of their followers, it could hardly be\nexpected that they would engage, with advantage, the well-appointed and\nregular force of the Duke of Monmouth; and that if they chanced, as was\nmost likely, to be defeated and dispersed, the insurrection in which they\nhad engaged, so far from being useful to the country, would be rendered\nthe apology for oppressing it more severely.Pressed by these arguments, and feeling it equally dangerous to remain\ntogether, or to dismiss their forces, most of the leaders readily agreed,\nthat if such terms could be obtained as had been transmitted to the Duke\nof Monmouth by the hands of Lord Evandale, the purpose for which they had\ntaken up arms would be, in a great measure, accomplished.They then\nentered into similar resolutions, and agreed to guarantee the petition\nand remonstrance which had been drawn up by Morton.On the contrary,\nthere were still several leaders, and those men whose influence with the\npeople exceeded that of persons of more apparent consequence, who\nregarded every proposal of treaty which did not proceed on the basis of\nthe Solemn League and Covenant of 1640, as utterly null and void,\nimpious, and unchristian.These men diffused their feelings among the\nmultitude, who had little foresight, and nothing to lose, and persuaded\nmany that the timid counsellors who recommended peace upon terms short of\nthe dethronement of the royal family, and the declared independence of\nthe church with respect to the state, were cowardly labourers, who were\nabout to withdraw their hands from the plough, and despicable trimmers,\nwho sought only a specious pretext for deserting their brethren in arms.These contradictory opinions were fiercely argued in each tent of the\ninsurgent army, or rather in the huts or cabins which served in the place\nof tents.Violence in language often led to open quarrels and blows, and\nthe divisions into which the army of sufferers was rent served as too\nplain a presage of their future fate.The curse of growing factions and divisions\n               Still vex your councils!The prudence of Morton found sufficient occupation in stemming the\nfurious current of these contending parties, when, two days after his\nreturn to Hamilton, he was visited by his friend and colleague, the\nReverend Mr Poundtext, flying, as he presently found, from the face of\nJohn Balfour of Burley, whom he left not a little incensed at the share\nhe had taken in the liberation of Lord Evandale.When the worthy divine\nhad somewhat recruited his spirits, after the hurry and fatigue of his\njourney, he proceeded to give Morton an account of what had passed in the\nvicinity of Tillietudlem after the memorable morning of his departure.The night march of Morton had been accomplished with such dexterity,\nand the men were so faithful to their trust, that Burley received no\nintelligence of what had happened until the morning was far advanced.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.His first enquiry was, whether Macbriar and Kettledrummle had arrived,\nagreeably to the summons which he had dispatched at midnight.Macbriar\nhad come, and Kettledrummle, though a heavy traveller, might, he was\ninformed, be instantly expected.Burley then dispatched a messenger to\nMorton's quarters to summon him to an immediate council.The messenger\nreturned with news that he had left the place.Poundtext was next\nsummoned; but he thinking, as he said himself, that it was ill dealing\nwith fractious folk, had withdrawn to his own quiet manse", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Burley's next\nenquiries were directed after Lord Evandale; and great was his rage when\nhe learned that he had been conveyed away over night by a party of the\nmarksmen of Milnwood, under the immediate command of Henry Morton\nhimself.exclaimed Burley, addressing himself to Macbriar; \"the\nbase, mean-spirited traitor, to curry favour for himself with the\ngovernment, hath set at liberty the prisoner taken by my own right hand,\nthrough means of whom, I have little doubt, the possession of the place\nof strength which hath wrought us such trouble, might now have been in\nour hands!\"said Macbriar, looking up towards the Keep\nof the Castle; \"and are not these the colours of the Covenant that float\nover its walls?\"\"A stratagem--a mere trick,\" said Burley, \"an insult over our\ndisappointment, intended to aggravate and embitter our spirits.\"He was interrupted by the arrival of one of Morton's followers, sent to\nreport to him the evacuation of the place, and its occupation by the\ninsurgent forces.Burley was rather driven to fury than reconciled by the\nnews of this success.\"I have watched,\" he said--\"I have fought--I have plotted--I have striven\nfor the reduction of this place--I have forborne to seek to head\nenterprises of higher command and of higher honour--I have narrowed their\noutgoings, and cut off the springs, and broken the staff of bread within\ntheir walls; and when the men were about to yield themselves to my hand,\nthat their sons might be bondsmen, and their daughters a laughing-stock\nto our whole camp, cometh this youth, without a beard on his chin, and\ntakes it on him to thrust his sickle into the harvest, and to rend the\nprey from the spoiler!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.Surely the labourer is worthy of his hire, and the\ncity, with its captives, should be given to him that wins it?\"\"Nay,\" said Macbriar, who was surprised at the degree of agitation which\nBalfour displayed, \"chafe not thyself because of the ungodly.Heaven will\nuse its own instruments; and who knows but this youth\"--\n\n\"Hush!<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.said Burley; \"do not discredit thine own better judgment.It was thou that first badest me beware of this painted sepulchre--this\nlacquered piece of copper, that passed current with me for gold.It fares\nill, even with the elect, when they neglect the guidance of such pious\npastors as thou.But our carnal affections will mislead us--this\nungrateful boy's father was mine ancient friend.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.They must be as earnest\nin their struggles as thou, Ephraim Macbriar, that would shake themselves\nclear of the clogs and chains of humanity.\"This compliment touched the preacher in the most sensible part; and\nBurley deemed, therefore, he should find little difficulty in moulding\nhis opinions to the support of his own views, more especially as they\nagreed exactly in their high-strained opinions of church government.\"Let us instantly,\" he said, \"go up to the Tower; there is that among the\nrecords in yonder fortress, which, well used as I can use it, shall be\nworth to us a valiant leader and an hundred horsemen.\"\"But will such be the fitting aids of the children of the Covenant?\"\"We have already among us too many who hunger after lands,\nand silver and gold, rather than after the Word; it is not by such that\nour deliverance shall be wrought out.\"\"Thou errest,\" said Burley; \"we must work by means, and these worldly men\nshall be our instruments.At all events, the Moabitish woman shall be\ndespoiled of her inheritance, and neither the malignant Evandale, nor the\nerastian Morton, shall possess yonder castle and lands, though they may\nseek in marriage the daughter thereof.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.So saying, he led the way to Tillietudlem, where he seized upon the plate\nand other valuables for the use of the army, ransacked the charter-room,\nand other receptacles for family papers, and treated with contempt the\nremonstrances of those who reminded him, that the terms granted to the\ngarrison had guaranteed respect to private property.Burley and Macbriar, having established themselves in their new\nacquisition, were joined by Kettledrummle in the course of the day, and\nalso by the Laird of Langcale, whom that active divine had contrived to\nseduce, as Poundtext termed it, from the pure light in which he had been\nbrought up.Thus united, they sent to the said Poundtext an invitation,\nor rather a summons, to attend a council at Tillietudlem.He remembered,\nhowever, that the door had an iron grate, and the Keep a dungeon, and\nresolved not to trust himself with his incensed colleagues.He therefore\nretreated, or rather fled, to Hamilton, with the tidings, that Burley,\nMacbriar, and Kettledrummle, were coming to Hamilton as soon as they\ncould collect a body of Cameronians sufficient to overawe the rest of the\narmy.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.\"And ye see,\" concluded Poundtext, with a deep sigh, \"that they will then\npossess a majority in the council; for Langcale, though he has always\npassed for one of the honest and rational party, cannot be suitably or\npreceesely termed either fish, or flesh, or gude red-herring--whoever has\nthe stronger party has Langcale.\"Thus concluded the heavy narrative of honest Poundtext, who sighed\ndeeply, as he considered the danger in which he was placed betwixt\nunreasonable adversaries amongst themselves and the common enemy from\nwithout.Morton exhorted him to patience, temper, and composure; informed\nhim of the good hope he had of negotiating for peace and indemnity\nthrough means of Lord Evandale, and made out to him a very fair prospect\nthat he should again return to his own parchment-bound Calvin, his\nevening pipe of tobacco, and his noggin of inspiring ale, providing\nalways he would afford his effectual support and concurrence to the\nmeasures which he, Morton, had taken for a general pacification.The author does not, by any means,\n     desire that Poundtext should be regarded as a just representation of\n     the moderate presbyterians, among whom were many ministers whose\n     courage was equal to their good sense and sound views of religion.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.Were he to write the tale anew, he would probably endeavour to give\n     the character a higher turn.It is certain, however, that the\n     Cameronians imputed to their opponents in opinion concerning the\n     Indulgence, or others of their strained and fanatical notions, a\n     disposition not only to seek their own safety, but to enjoy\n     themselves.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.Hamilton speaks of three clergymen of this description\n     as follows:--\n\n     \"They pretended great zeal against the Indulgence; but alas!<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.that\n     was all their practice, otherwise being but very gross, which I\n     shall but hint at in short.When great Cameron and those with him\n     were taking many a cold blast and storm in the fields and among the\n     cot-houses in Scotland, these three had for the most part their\n     residence in Glasgow, where they found good quarter and a full\n     table, which I doubt not but some bestowed upon them from real\n     affection to the Lord's cause; and when these three were together,\n     their greatest work was who should make the finest and sharpest\n     roundel, and breathe the quickest jests upon one another, and to\n     tell what valiant acts they were to do, and who could laugh loudest\n     and most heartily among them; and when at any time they came out to\n     the country, whatever other things they had, they were careful each\n     of them to have a great flask of brandy with them, which was very\n     heavy to some, particularly to Mr Cameron, Mr Cargill, and Henry\n     Hall--I shall name no more.\"--Faithful Contendings, p.Thus backed and comforted, Poundtext resolved magnanimously to await the\ncoming of the Cameronians to the general rendezvous.Your kindness lent to my caresses\n     That beauty you so lightly prize,--\n   The midnight of your sable tresses,\n     The twilight of your shadowed

and beguile\n   By fancies, which I backwards trace\n     To things I loved erstwhile;\n           The weary sweetness of your face,\n           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your

I meet you in my dreams!Second Song\n\n   How much I loved that way you had\n   Of smiling most, when very sad,\n   A smile which carried tender hints\n       Of delicate tints\n       And warbling

a controversy dating back to the \"free theatres\" of\nthe 1890 period in Paris, Berlin and London, the first performances of\nIbsen's \"Ghosts,\" and the early plays of Hauptmann and Strindberg.Then\nthe issues between Realist and Philistine were sharply defined;\nthe very terms were mutually exclusive.To be modern, to be \"free,\"\nwas to be an Ibsenite, an apostle of moral indignation, an author or\nplaygoer burning to lay bare social hypocrisies and shams; not merely\npour \u00e9pater le bourgeois, but in order to assert the Great Truths\nof Actual Life, so recently discovered by the stage.It mattered\nlittle that Ibsenites owed their existence to their misunderstanding\nof Ibsen.He had supplied them with an essential war cry.The old\ndomination of insincere sentiment and false romance in the theatre\nwas indefensible and insupportable.All the enthusiasm of dramatic\nreformers was perforce directed to the advance of the new realistic\nmovement.Hence arose a battle of epithets between the two camps,\nwith \"antiquated,\" \"conventional,\" \"sentimental,\" \"romantic\" on the\none hand, and \"vulgar,\" \"dreary,\" \"indecent,\" \"noisome\" on the other.In Anglo-Saxon countries, naturally enough, the issue was made one of\nmorality rather than artistic method.Ibsen's views on marriage were\nsuspect, and the whole dramatic movement lay in quarantine.Indeed,\nrealism in literature came to be regarded as an unsettling tendency,\nemanating from the Continent, and directed against all British\ninstitutions from property to religion.The division of opinion may\nbe studied in historical documents such as the criticisms of the\nLondon Press on the first English performance of \"Hedda Gabler,\" and\nthe early prefaces of Bernard Shaw; the one side tilting at realism,\nthe other at romance;--both, alas, the most shifty of windmills where\nmorality is concerned.The provocative cry of \"naturalism,\" raised by the newer dramatists and\ntheir supporters, was responsible for half the trouble.A naturalist,\nin good English usage, is taken to be a professor with a butterfly net\nor an inquirer into the lower forms of pond life; and there is a good\ndeal to be said for the analogy as applied to the author of realistic\nliterature.Pins and chloroform may be his implements of tragedy; his\ncoldly scientific method gives point to the comparison.Undoubtedly\nthe \"naturalistic drama\" suggested probable inhumanity and possible\nhorror.In any case it clearly offered no hope of an enjoyable evening,\nand was condemned from the first to be unpopular.So much for the misconception encouraged by a purely journalistic\nphrase.Useless to maintain that the older dramatists, from\nRobertson and Dumas fils to Sardou, held a monopoly of the milk\nof human kindness, while Ibsen, Hauptmann, Tolstoy and Strindberg\nwallowed in mere brutal, original sin.The alleged \"naturalism\" of\nthe latter belied its name.It ranged from revolutionary Utopian", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Indeed,\nthe differences between the old school and the new were as nothing\ncompared with the intellectual gulf between, say, Strindberg and\nTolstoy.Setting out from the common ground of external approximation\nto life, the dramatists of the period soon diverged upon individual\npaths.Hauptmann passed from the vivid and revolutionary \"Weavers\"\nto the mythology of \"Hannele\" and the \"Sunken Bell,\" and the simple\ndomestic drama of \"Fuhrmann Henschel\" and \"Rose Bernd.\"Tolstoy became\na preacher; Strindberg a Swedenborgian mystic.Of the early playwrights\nof the French Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre, Courteline and Ancey, practised the\nCom\u00e9die rosse, or brutal comedy, until Paris, tired of the uncouth\nnovelty, turned to the more amiable and no less natural work of Capus\nand Donnay.Brieux devoted himself to the composition of dramatic\ntracts.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.Bernard Shaw, after protesting that he \"could none other\" than\ndramatize slum landlords and rent collectors in \"Widowers' Houses,\"\nfound readier targets for his wit in bishops, professors of Greek and\nmillionaires.Nature, in fact, proved too strong for naturalism.No\nformula could embrace all the individual playwrights of that stormy\ntime.The most catholic of \"schools\" could not hold them.Formulas, however, die hard; and it is still necessary to free\nHeijermans from the \"naturalistic\" label so conveniently attached in\n1890 to works like Tolstoy's \"Power of Darkness,\" Hauptmann's Vor\nSonnenaufgang and Zola's \"Ther\u00e8se Raquin.\"All that his plays have\nin common with theirs is a faithful observation of life, and more\nparticularly of life among the common people.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Moreover, he belongs\nto a newer generation.He had written several short pieces (notably\nAhasuerus and 'n Jodenstreek?)in 1893 and 1894, but \"The Ghetto\"\n(1899) was his first important play.This three-act tragedy of the\nJewish quarter in a Dutch city has been published in an English\nadaptation which woefully misrepresents the original, and I should\nrather refer readers to a German translation (Berlin, Fleische)\nrevised by Heijermans himself.Like most early work, the play did\nnot satisfy its author, and several versions exist.Rafael, the son of an old Jewish merchant,\nhas an intrigue with the Gentile maidservant, Rose.His father,\nSachel, lives in an atmosphere of mistrust, hard dealing, thievery;\na patriarch with all the immemorial wrongs of the ghetto upon his\nshoulders, and all the racial instinct to preserve property, family\nand religion from contact with \"strange people.\"He is blind, but\nin the night he has heard the lovers' footsteps in the house.Rose\nhas lied to him; Rafael, as usual, is neglecting his business for\nGentile companions.After some bargaining over\nthe dowry, a marriage is arranged for Rafael with the daughter of\nanother merchant.The authority of the Rabbi is called in, but Rafael\nrefuses.He is a freethinker; in the ghetto, but not of it.\"Oh,\nthese little rooms of yours,--these hot, stifling chambers of despair,\nwhere no gust of wind penetrates, where the green of the leaves grows\nyellow, where the breath chokes and the soul withers!No, let me speak,\nRabbi Haeser!Now I am the priest; I, who am no Jew and no Christian,\nwho feel God in the sunlight, in the summer fragrance, in the gleam of\nthe water and the flowers upon my mother's grave... I have pity for\nyou, for your mean existence, for your ghettos and your little false\ngods--for the true God is yet to come, the God of the new community;\nthe commonwealth without gods, without baseness, without slaves!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Sachel is blamed for allowing this open rupture to come about.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.It\nis better to pay the girl off quietly and have done with her,\nargue the other Jews.Every woman has her price--and especially\nevery Gentile woman.A hundred gulden--perhaps two hundred if she\nis obstinate--will settle the matter.The money is offered, but Rose\nis not to be bought.She has promised to go away with Rafael as his\nwife.He has gone out, but he will return for her.The family tell\nher that the money is offered with his consent; that he is tired of\nher and has left home for good.She has learned\nto mistrust the word of the Jews; she will only believe their sacred\noath.At last old Sachel swears by the roll of the commandments that\nhis son will not return.In despair, Rose throws herself into the\ncanal and is drowned.Rafael comes too late to save her.The God of\nthe Jews has taken his revenge.The play is perhaps a little na\u00efve and crudely imagined, but it\nhas all the essential characteristics of Heijermans' later work;\nthe intense humanitarian feeling, the burning rhetoric, the frankly\npartisan denunciation of society.In\ndealing with such a case of bigotry and racial intolerance, it is\nidle for a playwright to hold the scales with abstract justice.At\nmost he can only humanise the tragedy by humanising the villains of\nhis piece, and showing them driven into cruelty by traditional forces\nbeyond their control.That is the part of the \"Ankl\u00e4ger,\" the social\nprophet and Public Prosecutor; and it is the part which Heijermans,\nabove all others, has filled in the newer dramatic movement.In Het Pantser (\"The Coat of Mail\") his subject is the life of a Dutch\ngarrison town.\"The Coat of Mail\" is militarism; the creed of the\ngoverning caste.And the setting is peculiarly apt for the presentation\nof a social issue.In a small country such as Holland military\npatriotism may be strong, but it is tempered by the knowledge that the\ncountry only exists by the tolerance, or the diplomatic agreement, of\nmore powerful neighbours, and that in case of war it could do no more\nthan sacrifice an army to the invader.To the philosophic workman,\nthen, well read in revolutionary literature from Marx to Kropotkin,\nthe standing army presents itself simply as a capitalist tool, a\nbulwark of the employing class against trade unionism.The industrial\nstruggle is uncomplicated by sentimentality.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Patriotic stampedes to the\nconservative side are unknown.Strikes are\nfrequent, and the protection of \"blackleg\" labourers is in the hands\nof the garrison.That is the theme of this \"romantic military play.\"Mari, a second lieutenant, refuses to serve on strike duty.He is a\nweak but sincere idealist; his head full of humanitarian enthusiasm,\nhis rooms stocked with anti-militarist pamphlets.He will leave the\narmy rather than order his men to fire on the factory workers.Around\nhim stand the members of the military caste, linked together by\ntradition and family relationship.His father is a colonel in the same\nregiment; the father of his fianc\u00e9e, Martha, is commanding officer.One\nfriend he has: an army doctor named Berens, who has infected himself\nwith cancer serum in attempting to discover a cure for the disease,\nand passes for a drunkard because he keeps the symptoms in check by\nalcohol.Here a parallel is drawn between military bravery and the\ncivilian courage of the scientist.Mari is put under arrest, but the affair is kept secret in order to\navoid a scandal.He can only be reinstated by full withdrawal and\napology.Martha comes to him and implores him to withdraw.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.He can plead the excitement of the moment\nin excuse, and the matter will be settled honorably.A friendly discussion of the point with his superior\nofficers is interrupted by a volley in the street outside.The troops\nhave fired upon the mob, and the son of the shoemaker over the way\nhas been shot.Mari sends in his papers; but a newspaper has published the facts of\nthe case, and he is met with the disgrace of immediate dismissal from\nthe army.She must marry a soldier; civilian\nlife with a dismissed lieutenant was not in the bond.So Mari suffers\nanother disillusionment, and the end of the play sees him setting\nout from home, while the old shoemaker is left to lament for his son.A warm heart, a weakness for rhetoric,\nand--a study in vacillation.In Ora et Labora Heijermans is less rhetorical; rather, one suspects,\nfor lack of a mouthpiece.His peasants bear their fate, if not in\nsilence, with almost inarticulate resignation.They are too hungry to\nwaste words.Moreover, there is no visible enemy to denounce, no Coat\nof Mail, no racial prejudice, no insatiate capitalism.Winter is the\nvillain of the piece.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.This is indeed naturalism, in the literal sense;\nhumanity devoured by Nature.Everything is frost-bound: the canal,\nthe soil, the very cattle.When the last cow upon the farm dies of disease, its throat\nis cut so that it can be sold to the butcher.All hopes are centred\nin the father of the family, who is to sell the carcase in the town;\nbut he spends the money and returns home drunk.As a last resort,\nhis son Eelke enlists in the army for six years' colonial service,\nleaving Sytske, the girl he was about to marry.His advance pay buys\nfuel and food, but the lovers part with a hopeless quarrel, and the\nold peasants are left wrangling over the money he has brought.Allerzielen (1906) is a later work.A village pastor finds a woman\nin a state of collapse upon his threshold.He takes her in, and she\ngives birth to a child.She is a stranger in the district, Rita by\nname.The child is sent into the village to be nursed, while the\npastor gives up his own room to the mother.She recovers slowly, and\nmeanwhile the peasants set their tongues to work upon the scandal.The\nchild is discovered to be illegitimate.A good village housewife is\nsuckling a bastard.The pastor is housing an outcast, and shows no\nsign of sending her about her business.Dimly and distantly the Bishop is said to be considering\nthe facts.... Amid alarums and excursions the affair pursues its\ncourse.The village passes from astonishment to ribaldry, from ribaldry\nto stone-throwing.The pastor speaks gently of Christian charity and\nsouls to be saved, but fails to appease his parishioners.They are\nhot upon the scent in a heresy-hunt.If they could see within the\nparsonage walls, they would yelp still louder.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.For Rita proves to be\nan unblushing hedonist.No prayers for her, when the birth-pangs are\nonce over; no tears, no repentance.She sings gaily in her room while\nthe pastors argue about duty and morals.She\ninvades the study to enjoy a view of sunlight, clouds and sea.She\nfinds the waves more musical than the wheezing of the church organ.If\nonly the child were with her, her happiness would be complete.But the child is neglected by its foster mother.The pastor is driven from his church by the Bishop, and leaves\nthe broken windows of the parsonage to his successor.Rita and he\nare both homeless now.And then the child's father comes,--another\nhedonist.Its body lies in\nunconsecrated ground, but the vows of love are renewed at the\ngraveside.All roads are\nopen to the spirits of the free.The pastor can only offer a hopeless\n\"Farewell\" as the two set out upon their way.But Rita calls after,\n\"No,--no!It matters nothing that this gospel of Life has often been\npreached.Heijermans has caught the spirit of it as well as the\nletter.His characters say and do nothing particularly original;\nnothing that would even pass for originality by reason of its\nmanner.He works in vivid contrasts, without a shade of paradox.He\nfigures the opposed forces of Reaction and Revolution in religion,\nin statecraft, in economics, in all human relationships, with a\nsimplicity of mind which would draw a smile from the forever up-to-date\n\"intellectual.\"Reaction is a devilish superstition; Revolution\na prophetic angel pointing the way to the promised land.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.The one\nis false, the other true.There is no disputing the point, since\ntruth and falsehood are absolute terms.Perhaps the secret is that\nHeijermans never tires of his own philosophy.He is content to see it\nfirmly planted on the ground; he does not demand that it should walk\nthe tight-rope or turn somersaults as an intellectual exercise.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.He\nhas accepted a view of life which some call materialistic, and others\npositivist, or scientific, or humanitarian; but for him it is simply\nhumane,--founded upon social justice and human need.A philosophy, however, does not make a dramatist.In the plays I\nhave already described Heijermans shows his power of translating\nthe world-struggle of thought into the dramatic clash of will, but\nit is upon \"The Good Hope\" (Op Hoop van Zegen) that his reputation\nchiefly depends.He chooses a great subject; not merely the conflict\nof shipowners and fishermen in the struggle for existence, but the\nsea-faring life and the ocean itself.Truly \"a sea-piece\"; tempestuous,\npowerful.From the opening\nscene, with the old men's tale of sharks, to the night of the storm\nin the third act, when the women and children huddle in Kneirtje's\ncottage for shelter, the story is always the same.It takes a father here, a brother there.It seizes\nGeert and Barend alike; the one going aboard carelessly, the other\nscreaming resistance.Sometimes it plays with its victims on shore,\nmaking no sign, leaving months of hope to end in despair.In a more\nmerciful mood it sends children running through the village to cry\n\"'n Ball op!as an overdue ship is signalled from the\ncoastguard tower.And there an echo of the sea-ballad now and again;\nwhen raps are heard upon the door at the height of the storm, or\na flapping curtain blows out the lamp, or a pallid face is seen at\nthe window....\n\nIn sheer force of theatrical construction \"The Good Hope\" is still\nmore striking.The play is\nfull of natural rather than violent coincidence.Barend has always\nfeared death by drowning, and he makes his first and last voyage in\na leaky trawler.His father sank in a wreck, and it is his mother,\nunable to maintain the household, who persuades him to go.She fears\nthe disgrace of his refusal after the papers are signed, but he is\ndragged aboard by the harbour police.His brother Geert sets out\nproudly enough, singing the Marseillaise and preaching rebellion;\nbut he sinks far away, impotent, unheard, and leaves his sweetheart\nto bear a fatherless child.Old Cobus can only reflect, \"We take\nthe fishes, and God takes us.\"That is perhaps the most dramatic\nthread of all,--the parallel of fate.The struggle for existence on\nland drives men to the fishing-boats and the Dogger Bank.From the\nminnows to leviathan, there is no escape.\"We take the fishes, and\nGod takes us.\"A gale of wind and rain whistles through the play,\nsweeping the decks of life, tossing men out into the unknown.The ship-owner, Bos, is frankly\na villain.He knows \"The Good Hope\" is unseaworthy, but he allows her\nto sail.True, the warning comes from a drunken ship's carpenter,\nbut he understands the risks.The ship is\nwell insured....\n\nIt is implied, then, that shipowners are unscrupulous scoundrels,\nand fishermen their unhappy victims.Here is a bias which makes\nthe actual tragedy no more impressive.Good ships, as well as bad,\nmay perish in a storm.Nature is cruel enough without the help of\nman.The problem of the big fish and the little fish is one of size,\nnot of morality.Even sharks may", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "It can only be said that Heijermans has here chosen the\nright motive for his own particular type of drama.He knows that, humanly speaking, in every conflict\nbetween employers and employed, the men are right and the masters\nwrong.Impossible to redress the balance by individual virtue or\nkindliness.The masters stand for the exploiting system; for capital,\nfor insurance, for power, for law and order and possession.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.Their\nrisks are less and their temptations greater.Even from the standpoint\nof abstract justice, a dishonest employer may fairly be set against\na drunken labourer or a gaol-bird fisherman.The one is no less\nnatural than the other.But Heijermans goes beyond all finicking\nconsiderations of this sort.He seeks to destroy and rebuild, not\nto repair or adjust.He avoids mere naturalism; the \"conscientious\ntranscription of all the visible and repetition of all the audible\"\nis not for him.And here he is undoubtedly justified, not only by\nhis own experience, but by that of other dramatists.There was no\ninspiration in the movement towards mere actuality on the stage.It\nsickened of its own surfeit of \"life.\"Its accumulated squalor became\nintolerable.It was choked by its own irrelevance, circumscribed\nby its own narrowness.For naturalism is like a prison courtyard;\nit offers only two ways of escape.One is the poet's upward flight,\nthe other the revolutionist's battering-ram.Heijermans has chosen\nhis own weapon, and used it well.He has given us \"The Good Hope,\"\nnot as a mere pitiful study in disillusionment, but as a tragic symbol\nof human effort in the conquest of despair.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Kneirtje, a fisherman's widow.Geert   }\n    Barend  }  her sons.Daantje, from the Old Men's Home.Mees, Marietje's betrothed.Truus, a fisherman's wife.The Drama is laid in a North Sea fishing village.Copyright 1912 by The Dramatic Publishing Company.THE GOOD HOPE\n\n                    A Drama of the Sea in Four Acts.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.[Kneirtje's home, a poor living-room.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.At the left, two wall bedsteads\nand a door;

the\nred lanterns at either end of each boat\nshowing as they came.But to-night, infected\nperhaps, by the pride, the evident delight, in\nJane's voice, the old familiar sight held them\nwith the new interest the past months had\nbrought to bear upon so many old, familiar things.\"It is--wonderful,\" Pauline said at last.\"It might be a scene from--fairyland, almost.\"\"Me--I love to see them come stealing long\nlike that through the dark,\" Jane said slowly\nand a little hesitatingly.It was odd to be\ntelling confidences to anyone except Tobias.\"I don't know where they come from, nor\nwhere they're a-going to.Many's the night\nI walk over here just on the chance of seeing\none.Mostly, this time of year, you're pretty\nlikely to catch one.When I was younger, I\nused to sit and fancy myself going aboard on\none of them and setting off for strange parts.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.I wasn't looking to settle down here in Winton\nall my days; but I reckon, maybe, it's just's\nwell--anyhow, when I got the freedom to\ntravel, I'd got out of the notion of it--and\nperhaps, there's no telling, I might have been\nterribly disappointed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.And there ain't any\nhindrance 'gainst my setting off--in my own\nmind--every time I sits here and watches a\ntow go down the lake.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.I've seen a heap of\nbig churches in my travels--it's mostly easier\n'magining about them--churches are pretty\nmuch alike I reckon, though I ain't seen many, I'll admit.\"No one answered for a moment, but Jane,\nused to Tobias for a listener, did not mind.Then in the darkness, Hilary laid a hand\nsoftly over the work-worn ones clasped on\nJane's lap.It was hard to imagine Jane\nyoung and full of youthful fancies and\nlongings; yet years ago there had been a Jane--not\nSextoness Jane then--who had found\nWinton dull and dreary and had longed to get\naway.But for her, there had been no one to\nwave the magic wand, that should transform\nthe little Vermont village into a place filled\nwith new and unexplored charms.Never in\nall Jane's many summers, had she known one\nlike this summer of theirs; and for them--the\nwonder was by no means over--the years\nahead were bright with untold possibilities.Hilary sighed for very happiness, wondering\nif she were the same girl who had rocked\nlistlessly in the hammock that June morning,\nprotesting that she didn't care for \"half-way\" things.\"I'm ever so glad we came, thank you so\nmuch, Jane,\" Pauline said heartily.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.\"I wonder what'll have happened by the\ntime we all see our next tow go down,\" Josie\nsaid, as they started towards home.\"We may see a good many more than one\nbefore the general exodus,\" her brother answered.\"But we won't have time to come watch for\nthem.Oh, Paul, just think, only a little\nwhile now--\"\n\nTom slipped into step with Hilary, a little\nbehind the others.\"I never supposed the old\nsoul had it in her,\" he said, glancing to where\nJane trudged heavily on ahead.\"Still, I\nsuppose she was young--once; though I've never\nthought of her being so before.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.\"I wonder,--maybe,\nshe's been better off, after all, right, here at\nhome.She wouldn't have got to be\nSextoness Jane anywhere else, probably.\"\"Is there a\nhidden meaning--subject to be carefully avoided?\"\"So you and Paul are off on your travels, too?\"\"Yes, though I can hardly believe it yet.\"\"And just as glad to go as any of us.\"\"Oh, but we're coming back--after we've\nbeen taught all manner of necessary things.\"\"Edna'll be the only one of you girls left\nbehind; it's rough on her.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.\"It certainly is; we'll all have to write her\nheaps of letters.\"\"Much time there'll be for letter-writing,\noutside of the home ones,\" Tom said.\"Speaking of time,\" Josie turned towards\nthem, \"we're going to be busier than any bee\never dreamed of being, before or since Dr.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.They certainly were busy days that\nfollowed.So many of the young folks were\ngoing off that fall that a good many of the\nmeetings of \"The S. W. F. Club\" resolved\nthemselves into sewing-bees, for the girl members only.\"If we'd known how jolly they were, we'd\nhave tried them before,\" Bell declared one\nmorning, dropping down on the rug Pauline\nhad spread under the trees at one end of the\nparsonage lawn.Patience, pulling bastings with a business-like\nair, nodded her curly head wisely.\"Miranda says,\nfolks mostly get 'round to enjoying\ntheir blessings 'bout the time they come to lose them.\"\"Has the all-important question been\nsettled yet, Paul?\"Edna asked, looking up from\nher work.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.She might not be going away to\nschool, but even so, that did not debar one\nfrom new fall clothes at home.\"They're coming to Vergennes with me,\"\nBell said.\"Then we can all come home\ntogether Friday nights.\"\"They're coming to Boston with me,\" Josie\ncorrected, \"then we'll be back together for\nThanksgiving.\"Shirley, meekly taking her first sewing\nlessons under Pauline's instructions, and frankly\ndeclaring that she didn't at all like them,\ndropped the hem she was turning.\"They're\ncoming to New York with me; and in the\nbetween-times we'll have such fun that they'll\nnever want to come home.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.\"It looks as though\nHilary and I would have a busy winter\nbetween you all.It is a comfort to know where\nwe are going.\"she warned, when later the\nparty broke up.\"Are we going out in a blaze of glory?\"\"You might tell us where we are going,\nnow, Paul,\" Josie urged.\"You wait until\nFriday, like good little girls.Mind, you all\nbring wraps; it'll be chilly coming home.\"Pauline's turn was to be the final wind-up\nof the club's regular outings.", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "No one outside\nthe home folks, excepting Tom, had been\ntaken into her confidence--it had been\nnecessary to press him into service.And when, on\nFriday afternoon, the young people gathered\nat the parsonage, all but those named were\nstill in the dark.Allen, Harry Oram and Patience\nwere there; the minister and Dr.Brice\nhad promised to join the party later if possible.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.As a rule, the club picnics were cooperative\naffairs; but to-day the members, by special\nrequest, arrived empty-handed.Paul\nShaw, learning that Pauline's turn was yet to\ncome, had insisted on having a share in it.\"I am greatly interested in this club,\" he\nhad explained.\"I like results, and I think,\"\nhe glanced at Hilary's bright happy face,\n\"that the 'S.W. F. Club' has achieved at least\none very good result.\"And on the morning before the eventful\nFriday, a hamper had arrived from New\nYork, the watching of the unpacking of which\nhad again transformed Patience, for the time,\nfrom an interrogation to an exclamation point.\"It's a beautiful hamper,\" she explained to\nTowser.\"It truly is--because father says,\nit's the inner, not the outer, self that makes\nfor real beauty, or ugliness; and it certainly\nwas the inside of that hamper that counted.See here,\nsuppose you follow on kind of quietly\nto-morrow afternoon--don't show up too soon, and\nI guess I can manage it.\"Which piece of advice Towser must have\nunderstood.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.At any rate, he acted upon it to\nthe best of his ability, following the party at a\ndiscreet distance through the garden and down\nthe road towards the lake; and only when the\nhalt at the pier came, did he venture near, the\nmost insinuating of dogs.And so successfully did Patience manage\nit, that when the last boat-load pushed off\nfrom shore, Towser sat erect on the narrow\nbow seat, blandly surveying his fellow\nvoyagers.\"He does so love picnics,\" Patience\nexplained to Mr.Dayre, \"and this is\nthe last particular one for the season.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.I kind\nof thought he'd go along and I slipped in a\nlittle paper of bones.\"\"I wish we\nwere--the water's quiet as a mill-pond this afternoon.\"For the great lake, appreciating perhaps\nthe importance of the occasion, had of its many\nmoods chosen to wear this afternoon its\nsweetest, most beguiling one, and lay, a broad\nstretch of sparkling, rippling water, between\nits curving shores.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.Beyond, the range of mountains rose dark\nand somber against the cloud-flecked sky,\ntheir tops softened by the light haze that told\nof coming autumn.And presently, from boat to boat, went the\ncall, \"We're going to Port Edward!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.\"But that's not _in_ Winton,\" Edna protested.\"Of it, if not in it,\" Jack Ward assured them.\"Do you reckon you can show us anything\nnew about that old fort, Paul Shaw?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.\"Why, I could go all over it\nblindfolded.\"\"Not to show the new--to unfold the old,\"\nPauline told him.\"It is--in substance,\" Pauline looked across\nher shoulder to where Mr.Allen sat,\nimparting information to Harry Oram.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"So that's why you asked the old fellow,\"\nTracy said.They were rounding the slender point on\nwhich the tall, white lighthouse stood, and\nentering the little cove where visitors to the fort\nusually beached their boats.A few rods farther inland, rose the tall,\ngrass-covered, circular embankment,\nsurrounding the crumbling, gray walls, the outer\nshells of the old barracks.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.At the entrance to the enclosure, Tom\nsuddenly stepped ahead, barring the way.\"No\npassing within this fort without the\ncounter-sign,\" he declared.\"'It's a\nhabit to be happy,'\" she suggested, and Tom\ndrew back for her to enter.But one by one,\nhe exacted the password from each.Inside, within the shade of those old, gray\nwalls, a camp-fire had been built and\ncamp-kettle swung, hammocks had been hung under\nthe trees and when cushions were scattered\nhere and there the one-time fort bore anything\nbut a martial air.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.But something of the spirit of the past must\nhave been in the air that afternoon, or perhaps,\nthe spirit of the coming changes; for this\npicnic--though by no means lacking in charm--was\nnot as gay and filled with light-hearted\nchaff as usual.There was more talking in\nquiet groups, or really serious searching for\nsome trace of those long-ago days of storm and stress.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.With the coming of evening, the fire was\nlighted and the cloth laid within range of its\nflickering shadows.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.The night breeze had\nsprung up and from outside the sloping\nembankment they caught the sound of the waves\nbreaking on the beach.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.True to their\npromise, the minister and Dr.Brice appeared at\nthe time appointed and were eagerly welcomed\nby the young people.Supper was a long, delightful affair that\nnight, with much talk of the days when the\nfort had been devoted to far other purposes\nthan the present; and the young people,\nlistening to the tales Mr.Allen told in his quiet yet\nstrangely vivid way, seemed to hear the slow\ncreeping on of the boats outside and to be\nlistening in the pauses of the wind for the\napproach of the enemy.\"I'll take it back, Paul,\" Tracy told her, as\nthey were repacking the baskets.\"Even the\nold fort has developed new interests.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.W. F. Club' will\ncontinue its good work,\" Jack said.Going back, Pauline found herself sitting\nin the stern of one of the boats, beside her\nfather.The club members were singing the\nclub song.But Pauline's thoughts had\nsuddenly gone back to that wet May afternoon.She could see the dreary, rain-swept garden,\nhear the beating of the drops on the\nwindow-panes.How long ago and remote it all\nseemed; how far from the hopeless discontent,\nthe vague longings, the real anxiety of that\ntime, she and Hilary had traveled.\"There's one thing,\"\nshe said, \"we've had one summer that I shall\nalways feel would be worth reliving.And\nwe're going to have more of them.\"Pauline looked about her--the lanterns at\nthe ends of the boats threw dancing lights out\nacross the water, no longer quiet; overhead,\nthe sky was bright with stars.\"Everything\nis so beautiful,\" the girl said slowly.\"One\nseems to feel it more--every day.\"\"'The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the\nLord hath made even both of them,'\" her\nfather quoted gravely.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.\"The\nhearing ear and the seeing eye\"--it was a good\nthought to take with them--out into the new\nlife, among the new scenes.One would need\nthem everywhere--out in the world, as well as\nin Winton.And then, from the boat just\nahead, sounded Patience's clear\ntreble,--\"'There's a Good Time Coming.'\"Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,\nwhich was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with\ncheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and\nthe rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our\nmen, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations\nwith the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that\nthe rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.In fact, many of the rebels\nseemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,\ndissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands\neager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to\neat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with\nColonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender\nhad taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that\neverything had been appropriated before our arrival.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.Wilmer McLean, in\nwhose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at\nManassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.I asked him to write his\nname in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden\nharvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories\nof these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record\nof great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their\nheads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the\ncongratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They\nfelt they had done their duty, and given the \"tottering giant\" a blow that\nlaid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the\nbrown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door\nin this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it\nopened cautiously, and a man's head appeared in it for an instant and\nwas withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber\nstopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the\nstreet.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying\ninside dead, and the streets were still empty.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to\nfrighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of\nmust belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured\nhimself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would\nhave liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in\nadventure, in the wrong.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.So he approached the door silently, and jumped\nand caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of\nthe door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked\ncautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the\nonly noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had\nrested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to\nopen the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it\nheavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down\ndirectly on the other's head and shoulders.He could see the top of the\nman's head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he\nheld a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of\ndifferent sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below\nhad robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for\nhis having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his\ntreasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a\nfight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed\nby the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the\ntwo bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of\nsociety, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top\nof the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him\nand shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his\nmovements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped\nupon the man's head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk\nwith him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but\nbefore the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,\nVan Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his\nhand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly\nto where it lay and picked it up and said, \"Now, if you try to get up\nI'll shoot at you.\"He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous\ninclination to add, \"and I'll probably miss you,\" but subdued it.The\nburglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but\nsat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: \"Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a\ndegree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined.\"Go ahead,\" reiterated the man, doggedly, \"I won't move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening\nin his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down\nand ask the burglar to tell him all about it.\"You haven't got much heart,\" said Van Bibber, finally.\"You're a pretty\npoor sort of a burglar, I should say.\"\"I won't go back--I won't go\nback there alive.I've served my time forever in that hole.If I have to\ngo back again--s'help me if I don't do for a keeper and die for it.But\nI won't serve there no more.\"asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; \"to\nprison?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.cried the man, hoarsely: \"to a grave.Look at my face,\" he said, \"and look at my hair.That ought to tell you\nwhere I've been.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the\nlife out of my legs.I couldn't hurt you if\nI wanted to.I'm a skeleton and a baby, I am.And\nnow you're going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty\nyears, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my\ntime so well and worked so hard.\"Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one\nhand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps\nof the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was\ndriving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver.\"You didn't\nwaste much time,\" he said.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.\"No,\" answered the man, sullenly, \"no, I didn't.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.I knew this place and\nI wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I'd have to\nwait until I earned it, and I couldn't wait.I haven't seen my wife\nfor seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of\nthat--seven years.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.Seven years without\nseeing your wife or your child!And they're straight people, they are,\"\nhe added, hastily.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.\"My wife moved West after I was put away and took\nanother name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join 'em,\nand I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now,\" he\nadded, dropping his face in his hands, \"I've got to go back.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.And I had\nmeant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.An' I don't care whether you believe\nit or not neither,\" he added, fiercely.\"I didn't say whether I believed it or not,\" answered Van Bibber, with\ngrave consideration.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar\nlooked back at him", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Perhaps it was\nbecause of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved\nVan Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly.\"I\nsuppose, though,\" he said, as though speaking to himself, \"that I ought\nto give you up.\"\"I'll never go back alive,\" said the burglar, quietly.\"Well, that's bad, too,\" said Van Bibber.\"Of course I don't know\nwhether you're lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I\nvery much doubt it; but I'll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,\nand I'll see you on the train.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.And you can get off at the next station\nand rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw\nthose bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the\nmilkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your\npockets, and don't try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful\nlook at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he\nwas directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept\njust behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to\nwhat he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,\nbut he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived\nin the West, and who were \"straight.\"asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.\"Helena, Montana,\" answered the man with, for the first time, a look of\nrelief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar.\"I\nsuppose you know,\" he said, \"that you can sell that at a place down town\nfor half the money.\"\"Yes, I know that,\" said the burglar.There was a\nhalf-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the\nrestaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his\neyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave\nhim some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of\nthe station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and\nclerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and\ncrossed over to Delmonico's for his breakfast, and, while the waiter\nlaid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the\npapers.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance\non the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With\ngreater interest he read of the fight between \"Dutchy\" Mack and the\n\"Black Diamond,\" and then he read carefully how \"Abe\" Hubbard, alias\n\"Jimmie the Gent,\" a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had\nbeen traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van\nBibber breathed quickly as he read it.\"The detectives have a clew of\nhis whereabouts,\" the account said; \"if he is still in the city they are\nconfident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who\nhelped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to\nget out West.\"\"They may do that,\" murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim\ncontentment; \"they probably will.\"Then he said to the waiter, \"Oh, I don't know.Some bacon and eggs and\ngreen things and coffee.\"VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN\n\n\nYoung Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer\nabout the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found\nthe city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that\nhas been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the\ncountry.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,\nhe decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where\nsome one had told him you could get particular things particularly well\ncooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about\nthem, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling\nhorse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables\nwere unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in\na French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed\nthe awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late\nbreakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most\nremarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a\nyoung lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young\nman's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth\nmoved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in\na most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed\nFrench hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly\nwell-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be\ndining alone with so young a man.\"It wasn't my fault,\" he heard the youth say earnestly.\"How could I\nknow he would be out of town?<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.Your\ncousin is not the only clergyman in the city.\"\"Of course not,\" said the girl, almost tearfully, \"but they're not my\ncousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much\ndifferent.\"Runaway couple,\" commented Van Bibber.Read about\n'em often; never seen 'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what\nfollowed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,\nand though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they\ndid not heed him nor lower their voices.said the girl, severely but not\nunkindly.\"It doesn't seem to me that you are exactly rising to the\noccasion.\"\"Well, I don't know,\" answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of\ntown now.You go on and eat something, and I'll get a directory and look\nup a lot of clergymen's addresses, and then we can make out a list and\ndrive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his\nvacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at\nfive this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River\nto-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.\"\"They'll never forgive us,\" said the girl.\"Oh, well, that's all right,\" exclaimed the young man, cheerfully.\"Really, you're the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away\nwith.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing\nenough two days ago, and now you don't help me at all.he asked, and then added, \"but please don't say so, even if you are.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.\"No, not sorry, exactly,\" said the girl; \"but, indeed, Ted, it is going\nto make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a\nbest man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish\nregistry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been\nat home to do the marrying.\"The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression\nof his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her\nhandkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he\nturned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van\nBibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston\nfamily named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who\nwas Van Bibber's particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual\nrecognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had\ndashed up the side street and was turning the corner.\"Standish,\" said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, \"pay\nthis chap for these things, will you, and I'll get rid of your brother.\"Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish\ncame up them on a jump.\"Wait a minute; where are you\ngoing?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;\nthen I see you.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had\nseen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and\nthat they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were\nto depart for Chicago.\"The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said\nthey could not have left this place by the time I would reach it,\" said\nthe elder brother, doubtfully.\"That's so,\" said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously.\"I\nbrought 'em here not more'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back\nto the depot.\"Yes, but they have,\" said Van Bibber.\"However, if you get over to\nJersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon\nas they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.\"\"Thank you, old fellow,\" shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the\nmarriage, only too young, you know.\"Don't mention it,\" said Van Bibber, politely.\"Now, then,\" said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple\ntrembling on the terrace, \"I've sent your brother off to Chicago.I\ndo not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a\nhoneymoon.But I'm not used to lying and I'm not very good at it.Now,\nif you will introduce me, I'll see what can be done toward getting you\ntwo babes out of the woods.\"Standish said, \"Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of\nwhom you have heard my brother speak,\" and Miss Cambridge said she\nwas very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying\ncircumstances.\"Now what you two want to do,\" said Van Bibber, addressing them as\nthough they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least\nforty, \"is to give this thing all the publicity you can.\"chorused the two runaways, in violent protest.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,\nwho would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or\na witness, just like any eloping farmer's daughter and lightning-rod\nagent.Why you were not married\nrespectably in church I don't know, and I do not intend to ask, but\na kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor\nscandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names\ninto all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and\nyou will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just\nrely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It's all going to\ncome out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially\ngood.\"Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,\nwhere he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have\nthe church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a\ndistrict-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o'clock.\"And now,\" he soliloquized, \"I must get some names.It doesn't matter\nmuch whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,\nbut they must be names that everybody knows.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.Whoever is in town will be\nlunching at Delmonico's, and the men will be at the clubs.\"So he first\nwent to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found\nMrs.\"Regy\" Van Arnt and Mrs.\"Jack\" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,\nwho had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the\nBoston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to\nsecrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom\neverybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly\ninvited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told\nthem that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then\nhe sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall\nRiver boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs.\"Regy\" Van\nArnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got\ninto another cab and carried off the groom.\"I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now,\" said Van\nBibber, as they drove to the church, \"and this is the first time I ever\nappeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge\nyachting suit.But then,\" he added, contentedly, \"you ought to see the\nother fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.\"\"Regy\" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but\nthe bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her\nprospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of\nthe men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he\nhad ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and\nthe assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men\ninsisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the\nabsence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a\nhandful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at\nthe club--after them as they drove off to the boat.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.\"Now,\" said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, \"I\nwill send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will\nread like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of\nthe season.And yet I can't help thinking--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\"Regy,\" as he paused doubtfully.\"Well, I can't help thinking,\" continued Van Bibber, \"of Standish's\nolder brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the\nshade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows,\" he\nadded, mournfully, \"that when a man is not practised in lying, he should\nleave it

mighty swing,\n      When heaving to the tempest's wing,\n        They hurl'd them on the foe.I heard the lance's shivering crash,\n    As when the whirlwind rends the ash;\n    I heard the

as by the outcry riven,\n    Pour'd down at once the lowering heaven;\n    A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,\n    Her billows rear'd their snowy crest.Well for the swimmer swell'd they high,\n

desperate fight,\n    Bloody with spurring came a knight,\n    Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag,\n    Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple.Clarion

sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN\n\nI don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.STEIN\n\nBut what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of

the door, stepping backward.He\nheaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._\n\nVON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN\n\nThen I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD\n\nYou

are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\n_Again turning to the door._\n\nPlease investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a\ncommotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps\ngrowing, turning at times into a loud roar._\n\nWhat is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in\nexcitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._\n\nOFFICER\n\nI want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD\n\n_Hissing._\n\nYou are insane!I have the honor to report to you that the\nBelgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._\n\nWe must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER\n\nThey are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER\n\nCompose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you\nabout our field

is--\n\n_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._\n\nAbsurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The\nfrightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The\nlights

mad!STEIN\n\nBut that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU\n\nThey may have availed themselves--\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nAren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--\n\n_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to\nretreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\n_Shots._\n\nWho has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\nThis is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called\nsoldiers!BLUMENFELD\n\n_Stepping forward, with dignity._\n\nYour Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is\ngrowing._\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nYour Highness!Your life is in danger--your\nHighness.Only the\nsentinel remains in the position of one petrified._\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nYour Highness!Your life--I am afraid

but the rebel\ninfantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and\ndestruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so\nas soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,\nonly to recoil in confusion and loss.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Confident that this mode of fighting\nwould not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the\noffensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I\nwent to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would\nlet me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He\nexcitedly replied, \"Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything\nyou can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold\nof the pike to-night.\"Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by\nme, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other\nregiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge\ndown a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery\nwas posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright\nlights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot\nswept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The\nline was broken, and the enemy routed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.Custer, with the whole division,\nnow pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither\nprisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and\nartillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and\nheaded for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we\ndiscovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit\nwas checked.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his\nroute to Lynchburg was still open before him;

but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry\ncorps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the\nposition of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who\ngreeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.At several places we had to \"run the gauntlet\" of fire from the enemy's\nguns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest\nof the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy\nto put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at\nlast Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving\nat almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of\na surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste\nfor the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a\nparty of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly\nreplied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a\ncharge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the\ncharge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we\nhalted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we\ncharged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front\nwas a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,\nwith batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have\ncharged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost\ntotal annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that\npreliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon\nall became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward\nbetween the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends\namong the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee\n(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus\nWilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the\nground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I\ncalled to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a\nhostile manner.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General\nLee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General\nBabcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our\nlines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he\ngracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,\nwhich was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with\ncheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and\nthe rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our\nmen, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations\nwith the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that\nthe rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels\nseemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,\ndissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands\neager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to\neat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with\nColonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender\nhad taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that\neverything had been", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Wilmer McLean, in\nwhose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at\nManassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his\nname in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden\nharvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories\nof these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record\nof great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their\nheads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the\ncongratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They\nfelt they had done their duty, and given the \"tottering giant\" a blow that\nlaid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.Thomas had spent the night in throwing up breastworks\non the brow of Snodgrass Hill, as it was anticipated that the Confederates\nwould concentrate their attack upon his position.Hostilities began with a general movement of the Confederate right wing in\nan attempt to flank the Union left.General Bragg had ordered Polk to\nbegin the attack at daybreak, but it was nearly ten o'clock in the morning\nbefore Breckinridge's division, supported by General Cleburne, advanced\nupon Thomas' entrenchments.Fighting desperately, the Confederates did not\nfalter under the heavy fire of the Federals, and it seemed as if the\nlatter must be driven from their position.Rosecrans, in response to\nurgent requests for reenforcements, despatched troops again and again to\nthe aid of Thomas, and the assault was finally repulsed.Cleburne's\ndivision was driven back with heavy loss, and Breckinridge, unable to\nretain any advantage, was forced to defend his right, which was being\nseriously menaced.The battle at this point had been desperately waged,\nboth sides exhibiting marked courage and determination.As on the previous\nday, the Confederates had been the aggressors, but the Federal troops had\nresisted all attempts to invade their breastworks.However, the fortunes of battle were soon to incline to the side of the\nSouthern army.Bragg sent Stewart's division forward, and it pressed\nReynolds' and Brannan's men back to their entrenchments.Rosecrans sent\nWood word to close up on Reynolds.Through some misunderstanding in giving\nor interpreting this order, General Wood withdrew his division from its\nposition on the right of Brannan.By this movement a large opening was\nleft almost in the center of the battle-line.Johnson's, Hindman's, and\nKershaw's divisions rushed into the gap and fell upon the Union right and\ncenter with an impetus that was irresistible.The Confederate general,\nBushrod Johnson, has given us an unforgetable picture of the thrilling\nevent: \"The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns\nsweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields\nflooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery\nand mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our\narmy, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-arms--of whistling balls, and\ngrape-shot, and of bursting shell--made up a battle-scene of unsurpassed\ngrandeur.Here, General Hood gave me the last order I received from him on\nthe field, 'Go ahead and keep ahead of everything.'\"A moment later, and\nHood fell, severely wounded, with a minie ball in his thigh.Wood's right brigade was shattered even before it had cleared the opening.Sheridan's entire division, and part of Davis' and Van Cleve's, were\ndriven from the field.Longstreet now gave a fine exhibition of his\nmilitary genius.The orders of battle were to separate the two wings of\nthe opposing army.But with the right wing of his opponents in hopeless\nruin, he wheeled to the right and compelled the further withdrawal of\nFederal troops in order to escape being surrounded.The brave\nsoldier-poet, William H. Lytle, fell at the head of his brigade as he\nstrove to re-form his line.McCook and Crittenden were unable, in spite of\nseveral gallant efforts, to rally their troops and keep back the onrushing\nheroes of Stone's River and Bull Run.The broken mass fled in confusion\ntoward Chattanooga, carrying with it McCook, Crittenden, and Rosecrans.The latter telegraphed to Washington that his army had been beaten.In\nthis famous charge the Confederates took several thousand prisoners and\nforty pieces of artillery.Flushed with victory, the Confederates now concentrated their attack upon\nThomas, who thus far, on Horseshoe Ridge and its spurs, had repelled all\nattempts to dislodge him.The Confederates, with victory within their\ngrasp, and led by the indomitable Longstreet, swarmed up the <DW72>s in\ngreat numbers, but they were hurled back with fearful slaughter.Thomas\nwas looking anxiously for Sheridan, whom, as he knew, Rosecrans had\nordered with two brigades to his support.But in Longstreet's rout of the\nright wing Sheridan, with the rest, had been carried on toward\nChattanooga, and he found himself completely cut off from Thomas, as the\nConfederates were moving parallel to him.Yet the indomitable Sheridan, in\nspite of his terrible experience of the morning, did not give up the\nattempt.Foiled in his efforts to get through McFarland's Gap, he moved\nquickly on Rossville and came down the Lafayette road toward Thomas' left\nflank.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.Meanwhile, advised by the incessant roar of musketry, General Gordon\nGranger, in command of the reserve corps near Rossville, advanced rapidly\nwith his fresh troops.Acting with promptness and alacrity under orders,\nGranger sent Steedman to Thomas' right.Directly across the line of Thomas' right was a ridge, on which Longstreet\nstationed Hindman with a large command, ready for an attack on Thomas'\nflank--a further and terrible menace to the nearly exhausted general, but\nit was not all.In the ridge was a small gap, and through this Kershaw was\npouring his division, intent on getting to Thomas' rear.Rosecrans thus\ndescribes the help afforded to Thomas: \"Steedman, taking a regimental\ncolor, led the column.Swift was the charge and terrible the conflict, but\nthe enemy was broken.\"The fighting grew fiercer, and at intervals was almost hand to hand.The\ncasualties among the officers, who frequently led their troops in person,\nwere mounting higher and higher as the moments passed.All the afternoon\nthe assaults continued, but the Union forces stood their ground.Ammunition ran dangerously low, but Steedman had brought a small supply,\nand when this was distributed each man had about ten rounds.Finally, as\nthe sun was setting in the west, the Confederate troops advanced in a\nmighty concourse.The combined forces of Kershaw, Law, Preston, and\nHindman once more rushed forward, gained possession of their lost ridge at\nseveral points, but were unable to drive their attack home.In many places\nthe Union lines stood firm and both sides rested in the positions taken.The onslaught on the Federal left of the\nbattlefield was one of the heaviest attacks made on a single point during\nthe war.History records no grander spectacle than Thomas' stand at Chickamauga.He\nwas ever afterwards known as \"The Rock of Chickamauga.\"Under the cover of\ndarkness, Thomas, having received word from Rosecrans to withdraw, retired\nhis army in good order to Rossville, and on the following day rejoined\nRosecrans in Chattanooga.The battle of Chickamauga, considering the\nforces engaged, was one of the most destructive of the Civil War.The\nUnion army lost approximately sixteen thousand men, and while the loss to\nthe Confederate army is not definitely known, it was probably nearly\neighteen thousand.The personal daring and tenacious courage displayed in\nthe ranks of both armies have never been excelled on any battlefield.The\nConfederate generals, Helm, Deshler, and Preston Smith were killed; Adams,\nHood, Brown, Gregg, Clayton, Hindman, and McNair were wounded.The battle is generally considered a Confederate victory,\nand yet, aside from the terrible loss of human life, no distinct advantage\naccrued to either side.The Federal army retained possession of\nChattanooga, but the Confederates had for the time checked the Army of the\nCumberland from a further occupation of Southern soil.It is a singular coincidence that the generals-in-chief of both armies\nexercised but little supervision over the movements of their respective\ntroops.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.The brunt of the battle fell, for the most part, upon the\ncommanders of the wings.To the subordinate generals on each side were\nawarded the highest honors.Longstreet, because of his eventful charge,\nwhich swept the right wing of the Union army from the field, was\nproclaimed the victor of Chickamauga; and to General Thomas, who by his\nfirmness and courage withstood the combined attack of the Confederate\nforces when disaster threatened on every side, is due the brightest\nlaurels from the adherents of the North.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE LEADER AT CHICKAMAUGA\n\nCOLLECTION OF FREDERICK H.

F. Smith, had begun to act on a\nplan which Rosecrans had conceived, and which proved in the end to be a\nbrilliant conception.This was to seize a low range of hills known as\nRaccoon Mountain on the peninsula made by a bend of the river, on its\nsouth side and west of Chattanooga, and establish a wagon road to Kelly's\nFerry, a point farther down the river to which supplies could be brought\nby boat from Bridgeport, and at the same time communication effected with\nHooker.A direct line was not only secured to Bridgeport, but Hooker advanced with\na portion of his troops into Lookout Valley and after a short but decisive\nskirmish drove the Confederates across Lookout Creek, leaving his forces\nin possession of the hills he had gained.The route was now opened between\nBridgeport and Brown's Ferry; abundant supplies were at once available and\nthe Army of the Cumberland relieved of its perilous position.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Unlike the condition which had prevailed at Chickamauga, reenforcements\nfrom all sides were hastening to the aid of Thomas' army; Hooker was\nalready on the ground; Sherman was advancing rapidly from Memphis, and he\narrived in person on November 15th, while Burnside's forces at Knoxville\noffered protection to the left flank of the Federal army.The disposition of the Confederate troops at this time was a formidable\none; the left flank rested on the northern end of Lookout Mountain and the\nline extended a distance of twelve miles across Chattanooga Valley to\nMissionary Ridge.This position was further strengthened by entrenchments\nthroughout the lowlands.Despite the danger which threatened his army from\nthe converging Union forces, General Bragg determined to attack Burnside\nand despatched Longstreet with twenty thousand of his best troops to\nKnoxville.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.His army materially weakened, the Confederate general continued\nto hold the same extended position, although his combined force was\nsmaller than had opposed Rosecrans alone at Chickamauga.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.On the 23d of November, after a long and fatiguing march over roads almost\nimpassable by reason of continuous rains, Sherman crossed the Tennessee by\nthe pontoon bridge at Brown's Ferry, recrossed it above Chattanooga, and\nwas assigned a position to the left of the main army near the mouth of\nChickamauga Creek.Grant had now some eighty thousand men, of whom sixty\nthousand were on the scene of the coming battle, and, though fearful lest\nBurnside should be dislodged from his position at Knoxville, he would not\nbe diverted from his purpose of sweeping the Confederates from the front\nof Chattanooga.It had been Grant's plan to attack on the 24th, but\ninformation reached him that Bragg was preparing a retreat.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.He, therefore,\non the 23d, ordered Thomas to advance upon Bragg's center.Preparations for movement were made in full view of the Confederates; from\nthe appearance of the troops, clad in their best uniforms, the advance\nline of the Southern army was content to watch this display, in the belief\nthat the maneuvering army was parading in review.Suddenly, the peaceful\npageant turned into a furious charge, before which the Confederate\npickets, taken by surprise, retreated from the first line of earthworks,\nand Thomas, with little loss to either side, captured Orchard Knob,\nbetween Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge.From this point, which was\nalmost a mile in advance of the position occupied during the morning,\nGrant directed the movements of his army on the following day.The Federal position was of less extent than that occupied by the\nConfederates.Sherman was in command of the left wing, while Thomas held\nthe center, and \"Fighting Joe\" Hooker, with the Union right in Lookout\nValley, threatened Lookout Mountain.The plan of battle was for Sherman to\nengage the Confederate right and sever communications between Bragg and\nLongstreet; Hooker was to carry out an assault on the Southern left flank,\nand at the same time maintain connection with Bridgeport.With both wings\nassailed by a superior force, it was believed that Bragg must reenforce\nthese positions and permit Thomas, with overwhelming numbers, to\nconcentrate upon the center.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.On the 24th, two distinct movements were in progress.Sherman met with but\nlittle opposition in his initial attack upon the Confederate right and\npromptly seized and occupied the north end of Missionary Ridge.The\nConfederates, late in the afternoon, fought desperately to regain the hill\nbut were finally repulsed, and Sherman fortified the position he had\ngained.In the mean time, Hooker, early in the day, had begun his\noperations against Lookout Mountain.Standing like a lone sentinel above\nthe surrounding valleys, its steep, rocky, and deeply furrowed <DW72>s,\nrising into a high, palisaded crest, frowned defiance upon the advancing\ntroops, while a well-constructed line of defenses completed the imposing\nbarrier.Hooker had in addition to his own troops a division of Sherman's army\n(Osterhaus') which, owing to damage to the pontoon bridge at Brown's\nFerry, had been prevented from joining its own leader.As ordered by\nHooker, General Geary took his division up the valley to Wauhatchie,\ncrossed the creek and marched down the east bank, sweeping the\nConfederate outposts before him.The remainder of the command got across\nby bridges lower down.Gaining the <DW72>s of the mountain the Federal\ntroops rushed on in their advance.From the high palisaded summit,\ninvisible in the low-hanging clouds, the guns of General Stevenson's\nbrigades poured an iron deluge upon them.But on they went, climbing over\nledges and boulders, up hill and down, while the soldiers of the South\nwith musket and cannon tried in vain to check them.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.Position after\nposition was abandoned to the onrushing Federals, and by noon Geary's\nadvanced troops had rounded the north <DW72> of the mountain and passed\nfrom the sight of General Hooker, who was watching the contest from a\nvantage point to the west.Grant and Thomas from the headquarters on\nOrchard Knob were likewise eager witnesses of the struggle, although the\nhaze was so dense that they caught a glimpse only now and then as the\nclouds would rise.Reenforcements came to the Confederates and they availed nothing.Geary's\ntroops had been ordered to halt when they reached the foot of the\npalisades, but fired by success they pressed impetuously forward.From its\nhigher position at the base of the cliff Cobham's brigade showered volley\nafter volley upon the Confederate main line of defense, while that of\nIreland gradually rolled up the flank.The Federal batteries on Moccasin\nPoint across the river were doing what they could to clear the mountain.The Southerners made a last stand in their walls and pits around the\nCraven house, but were finally driven in force over rocks and precipices\ninto Chattanooga Valley.Such was the \"battle in the clouds,\" a wonderful spectacle denied the\nremainder of Hooker's troops holding Lookout Valley.That general says,\n\"From the moment we had rounded the peak of the mountain it was only from\nthe roar of battle and the occasional glimpses our comrades in the valley\ncould catch of our lines and standards that they knew of the strife or\nits progress, and when from these evidences our true condition was\nrevealed to them their painful anxiety yielded to transports of joy which\nonly soldiers can feel in the earliest moments of dawning victory.\"By two in the afternoon the clouds had settled completely into the valley\nand the ensuing darkness put an end to further operations.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Hooker\nestablished and strengthened a new position and waited for reenforcements,\nwhich General Carlin brought from Chattanooga at five o'clock.Until after\nmidnight an irregular fire was kept up, but the Confederates could not\nbreak the new line.Before dawn General Stevenson abandoned the summit,\nleaving behind twenty thousand rations and the camp equipage of his three\nbrigades.Hooker, anticipating this move, sent several detachments to\nscale the palisades.A party of six men from the Eighth Kentucky regiment,\nby means of ladders, was the first to reach the summit, and the waving\nStars and Stripes greeted the rising sun of November 25th on Lookout\nMountain, amid the wild and prolonged cheers of \"Fighting Joe's\" valiant\ntroops.The fighting of Sherman and Hooker on the 24th secured to Grant's army a\ndistinct advantage in position.From the north end of Lookout Mountain\nacross Chattanooga Valley to the north end of Missionary Ridge the Union\nforces maintained an unbroken front.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.The morning of the 25th dawned cold, and an impenetrable mist which lay\ndeep in the valleys was soon driven away.From Orchard Knob, a point\nalmost in the center of the united Federal host, General Grant watched the\npreparations for the battle.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.At sunrise, Sherman's command was in motion.In his front, an open space intervened between his position and a ridge\nheld by the Confederates, while just beyond rose a much higher hill.Toward the first ridge the attacking column, under General Corse, advanced\nrapidly and in full view of the foe.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.For a time it seemed as if the\nConfederates must recede before the terrific onslaught, but the advance\nwas abruptly checked after a very close and stubborn struggle, when\nwithin a short distance of the entrenchment.Unmindful of the numbers which opposed him, General Hardee not only\nsucceeded in repulsing the attack, but, assuming the offensive, drove back\nthe forces under General John E. Smith, who had sought to turn his left,\nand captured several hundred prisoners.The Federals, quickly re-forming\ntheir lines, renewed the assault and for several hours the fighting was\ndesperate on both sides.A general advance of the Northern forces had been\nwithheld, awaiting the arrival of Hooker who, under orders from Grant, was\nsweeping down Chickamauga Valley, and was to operate against the\nConfederate left and rear, in the expectation that Bragg would further\nweaken his line by massing at those points.But Hooker's army had been\ndelayed several hours by repairs to the bridge crossing Chattanooga Creek.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Although Sherman had failed in his attempt to turn the Confederate right\nhe had forced Bragg to draw heavily upon his center for reenforcements.Grant, satisfied that Hooker was not far off, ordered the signal--six guns\nfired in rapid succession from the battery on Orchard Knob--for a general\nadvance of Thomas' army upon the Confederate center.It was now three o'clock in the afternoon.The four division commanders of\nthe Army of the Cumberland, Sheridan, Wood, Baird, and Johnson, gave the\nword to advance.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.Between Orchard Knob and the base of Missionary Ridge, a\nmile away, is a broad valley covered for the most part with heavy timber.This had to be crossed before the entrenchments at the foot of the hill\ncould be assaulted.Scarcely were the Cumberland<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.", "question": "Where is the milk?

only a\nsmall portion of it got away.On the Confederate right Hardee held his own against Sherman, but with the\nleft and center routed and in rapid flight Bragg realized the day was\nlost.He could do nothing but cover Breckinridge's retreat as best he\nmight and order Hardee to retire across Chickamauga Creek.Bragg's army had been wholly\ndefeated, and, after being pursued for some days, it found a resting place\nat Dalton among the mountains of Georgia.The Federal victory was the\nresult of a campaign carefully planned by Generals Halleck and Grant and\nably carried out by the efforts of the subordinate generals.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.The losses in killed and wounded sustained by Grant were over fifty-eight\nhundred and those of Bragg about sixty-six hundred, four thousand being\nprisoners.But the advantage of the great position had been forever\nwrested from the Southern army.[Illustration: THE BESIEGED\n\nCOPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.At this point, where Citico Creek joins the Tennessee, the left of the\nEleventh Corps of the Army of the Cumberland rested on the river bank, the\nlimit of the Federal line of defense, east of Chattanooga.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.Here, on high\nground overlooking the stream, was posted Battery McAloon to keep the\nConfederates back from the river, so that timber and firewood could be\nrafted down to the besieged army.In the chill of autumn, with scanty\nrations, the soldiers had a hard time keeping warm, as all fuel within the\nlines had been consumed.The Army of the Cumberland was almost conquered\nby hardship.Grant feared that the soldiers \"could not be got out of their\ntrenches to assume the offensive.\"But it was these very men who achieved\nthe most signal victory in the battle of Chattanooga.[Illustration: OPENING \"THE CRACKER LINE\"\n\nCOPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]_Chattanooga_ was the first steamboat built by the Federals\non the upper Tennessee River.Had the gunboats on the Ohio been able to\ncome up the Tennessee River nearly three hundred miles, to the assistance\nof Rosecrans, Bragg could never have bottled him up in Chattanooga.But\nbetween Florence and Decatur, Alabama, Muscle Shoals lay in the stream,\nmaking the river impassable.For a time\nhe repeated these words, sullenly and doggedly, in the manner of one\nreciting a task, or a liar who endeavours by reiteration to obtain\na credit for his words which he is internally sensible they do not\ndeserve.But when he lifted up his eyes, and beheld in the distance the\nblack outline of a gallows, at least forty feet high, with its ladder\nand its fatal cord, rising against the horizon, he became suddenly\nsilent, and the friar could observe that he trembled very much.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.\"Be comforted, my son,\" said the good priest, \"you have confessed\nthe truth, and received absolution.Your penitence will be accepted\naccording to your sincerity; and though you have been a man of bloody\nhands and cruel heart, yet, by the church's prayers, you shall be in due\ntime assoilzied from the penal fires of purgatory.\"These assurances were calculated rather to augment than to diminish\nthe terrors of the culprit, who was agitated by doubts whether the\nmode suggested for his preservation from death would to a certainty be\neffectual, and some suspicion whether there was really any purpose of\nemploying them in his favour, for he knew his master well enough to be\naware of the indifference with which he would sacrifice one who might on\nsome future occasion be a dangerous evidence against him.His doom, however, was sealed, and there was no escaping from it.They\nslowly approached the fatal tree, which was erected on a bank by the\nriver's side, about half a mile from the walls of the city--a site\nchosen that the body of the wretch, which was to remain food for the\ncarrion crows, might be seen from a distance in every direction.Here the priest delivered Bonthron to the executioner, by whom he was\nassisted up the ladder, and to all appearance despatched according to\nthe usual forms of the law.He seemed to struggle for life for a\nminute, but soon after hung still and inanimate.The executioner, after\nremaining upon duty for more than half an hour, as if to permit the\nlast spark of life to be extinguished, announced to the admirers of such\nspectacles that the irons for the permanent suspension of the carcass\nnot having been got ready, the concluding ceremony of disembowelling the\ndead body and attaching it finally to the gibbet would be deferred till\nthe next morning at sunrise.Notwithstanding the early hour which he had named, Master Smotherwell\nhad a reasonable attendance of rabble at the place of execution, to\nsee the final proceedings of justice with its victim.But great was the\nastonishment and resentment of these amateurs to find that the dead body\nhad been removed from the gibbet.They were not, however, long at a loss\nto guess the cause of its disappearance.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Bonthron had been the follower\nof a baron whose estates lay in Fife, and was himself a native of that\nprovince.What was more natural than that some of the Fife men, whose\nboats were frequently plying on the river, should have clandestinely\nremoved the body of their countryman from the place of public shame?The\ncrowd vented their rage against Smotherwell for not completing his\njob on the preceding evening; and had not he and his assistant betaken\nthemselves to a boat, and escaped across the Tay, they would have run\nsome risk of being pelted to death.The event, however, was too much in\nthe spirit of the times to be much wondered at.Its real cause we shall\nexplain in the following chapter.Let gallows gape for dogs, let men go free.Henry V.\n\n\nThe incidents of a narrative of this kind must be adapted to each other,\nas the wards of a key must tally accurately with those of the lock to\nwhich it belongs.The reader, however gentle, will not hold himself\nobliged to rest satisfied with the mere fact that such and such\noccurrences took place, which is, generally speaking, all that in\nordinary life he can know of what is passing around him; but he is\ndesirous, while reading for amusement, of knowing the interior movements\noccasioning the course of events.This is a legitimate and reasonable\ncuriosity; for every man hath a right to open and examine the mechanism\nof his own watch, put together for his proper use, although he is not\npermitted to pry into the interior of the timepiece which, for general\ninformation, is displayed on the town steeple.It would be, therefore, uncourteous to leave my readers under any doubt\nconcerning the agency which removed the assassin Bonthron from the\ngallows--an event which some of the Perth citizens ascribed to the foul\nfiend himself, while others were content to lay it upon the natural\ndislike of Bonthron's countrymen of Fife to see him hanging on the river\nside, as a spectacle dishonourable to their province.About midnight succeeding the day when the execution had taken place,\nand while the inhabitants of Perth were deeply buried in slumber, three\nmen muffled in their cloaks, and bearing a dark lantern, descended the\nalleys of a garden which led from the house occupied by Sir John Ramorny\nto the banks of the Tay, where a small boat lay moored to a landing\nplace, or little projecting pier.The wind howled in a low and\nmelancholy manner through the leafless shrubs and bushes; and a pale\nmoon \"waded,\" as it is termed in Scotland, amongst drifting clouds,\nwhich seemed to threaten rain.The three individuals entered the boat\nwith great precaution to escape observation.One of them was a tall,\npowerful man; another short and bent downwards; the third middle sized,\nand apparently younger than his companions, well made, and active.They seated themselves in the\nboat and unmoored it from the pier.\"We must let her drift with the current till we pass the bridge, where\nthe burghers still keep guard; and you know the proverb, 'A Perth\narrow hath a perfect flight,'\" said the most youthful of the party, who\nassumed the office of helmsman, and pushed the boat off from the pier;\nwhilst the others took the oars, which were muffled, and rowed with all\nprecaution till they attained the middle of the river; they then ceased\ntheir efforts, lay upon their oars, and trusted to the steersman for\nkeeping her in mid channel.In this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded beneath the stately\nGothic arches of the old bridge, erected by the magnificent patronage\nof Robert Bruce in 1329, and carried away by an inundation in 1621.Although they heard the voices of a civic watch, which, since these\ndisturbances commenced, had been nightly maintained in that important\npass, no challenge was given; and when they were so far down the stream\nas to be out of hearing of these guardians of the night, they began to\nrow, but still with precaution, and to converse, though in a low tone.\"You have found a new trade, comrade, since I left you,\" said one of the\nrowers to the other.\"I left you engaged in tending a sick knight, and I\nfind you employed in purloining a dead body from the gallows.\"\"A living body, so please your squirehood, Master Buncle, or else my\ncraft hath failed of its purpose.\"\"So I am told, Master Pottercarrier; but, saving your clerkship, unless\nyou tell me your trick, I will take leave to doubt of its success.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.\"A simple toy, Master Buncle, not likely to please a genius so acute as\nthat of your valiancie.This suspension of the human\nbody, which the vulgar call hanging, operates death by apoplexia--that\nis, the blood being unable to return to the heart by the compression\nof the veins, it rushes to the brain, and the man dies.Also, and as an\nadditional cause of dissolution, the lungs no longer receive the needful\nsupply of the vital air, owing to the ligature of the cord around the\nthorax; and hence the patient perishes.\"But how is such a revulsion of blood to\nthe brain to be prevented, sir mediciner?\"said the third person, who\nwas no other than Ramorny's page, Eviot.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.\"Marry, then,\" replied Dwining, \"hang me the patient up in such fashion\nthat the carotid arteries shall not be compressed, and the blood will\nnot determine to the brain, and apoplexia will not take place; and\nagain, if there be no ligature around the thorax, the lungs will be\nsupplied with air, whether the man be hanging in the middle heaven or\nstanding on the firm earth.\"\"All this I conceive,\" said Eviot; \"but how these precautions can be\nreconciled with the execution of the sentence of hanging is what my dull\nbrain cannot comprehend.\"good youth, thy valiancie hath spoiled a fair wit.Hadst thou\nstudied with me, thou shouldst have learned things more difficult than\nthis.I get me certain bandages, made of the same\nsubstance with your young valiancie's horse girths, having especial care\nthat they are of a kind which will not shrink on being strained, since\nthat would spoil my experiment.One loop of this substance is drawn\nunder each foot, and returns up either side of the leg to a cincture,\nwith which it is united; these cinctures are connected by divers straps\ndown the breast and back, in order to divide the weight.And there are\nsundry other conveniences for easing the patient, but the chief is this:\nthe straps, or ligatures, are attached to a broad steel collar, curving\noutwards, and having a hook or two, for the better security of the\nhalter, which the friendly executioner passes around that part of the\nmachine, instead of applying it to the bare throat of the patient.Thus, when thrown off from the ladder, the sufferer will find himself\nsuspended, not by his neck, if it please you, but by the steel circle,\nwhich supports the loops in which his feet are placed, and on which his\nweight really rests, diminished a little by similar supports under each\narm.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.Thus, neither vein nor windpipe being compressed, the man will\nbreathe as free, and his blood, saving from fright and novelty of\nsituation, will flow as temperately as your valiancie's when you stand\nup in your stirrups to view a field of battle.\"\"By my faith, a quaint and rare device!\"pursued the leech, \"and well worth being known to such\nmounting spirits as your valiancies, since there is no knowing to what\nheight Sir John Ramorny's pupils may arrive;

\"for his descent\nfrom the gibbet will but encourage him to new murders.He knows but two\nelements--drunkenness and bloodshed.\"\"Perhaps Sir John Ramorny might have been of your opinion,\" said\nDwining; \"but it would first have been necessary to cut out the rogue's\ntongue, lest he had told strange tales from his airy height.And there\nare other reasons that it concerns not your valiancies to know.In\ntruth, I myself have been generous in serving him, for the fellow is\nbuilt as strong as Edinburgh Castle, and his anatomy would have matched\nany that is in the chirurgical hall of Padua.But tell me, Master\nBuncle, what news bring you from the doughty Douglas?\"\"They may tell that know,\" said Buncle.\"I am the dull ass that bears\nthe message, and kens nought of its purport.I carried letters from the Duke of Albany and from Sir John\nRamorny to the Douglas, and he looked black as a northern tempest when\nhe opened them.I brought them answers from the Earl, at which they\nsmiled like the sun when the harvest storm is closing over him.Go to\nyour ephemerides, leech, and conjure the meaning out of that.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.\"Methinks I can do so without much cost of wit,\" said the chirurgeon;\n\"but yonder I see in the pale moonlight our dead alive.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the football there.Should he have\nscreamed out to any chance passenger, it were a curious interruption\nto a night journey to be hailed from the top of such a gallows as that.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.Hark, methinks I do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and\nthe creaking of the chains.So--fair and softly; make fast the boat\nwith the grappling, and get out the casket with my matters, we would be\nbetter for a little fire, but the light might bring observation on\nus.Come on, my men of valour, march warily, for we are bound for the\ngallows foot.Follow with the lantern; I trust the ladder has been left.\"Sing, three merry men, and three merry men,\n     And three merry men are we,\n     Thou on the land, and I on the sand,\n     And Jack on the gallows tree.\"As they advanced to the gibbet, they could plainly hear groans, though\nuttered in a low tone.Dwining ventured to give a low cough once or\ntwice, by way of signal; but receiving no answer, \"We had best make\nhaste,\" said he to his companions, \"for our friend must be in extremis,\nas he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help.I will go up the ladder first and cut the\nrope.Do you two follow, one after another, and take fast hold of the\nbody, so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed.Keep sure gripe,\nfor which the bandages will afford you convenience.Bethink you that,\nthough he plays an owl's part tonight, he hath no wings, and to fall out\nof a halter may be as dangerous as to fall into one.\"While he spoke thus with sneer and gibe, he ascended the ladder, and\nhaving ascertained that the men at arms who followed him had the body in\ntheir hold, he cut the rope, and then gave his aid to support the almost\nlifeless form of the criminal.By a skilful exertion of strength and address, the body of Bonthron was\nplaced safely on the ground; and the faint yet certain existence of life\nhaving been ascertained, it was thence transported to the river side,\nwhere, shrouded by the bank, the party might be best concealed from\nobservation, while the leech employed himself in the necessary means of\nrecalling animation, with which he had taken care to provide himself.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.For this purpose he first freed the recovered person from his shackles,\nwhich the executioner had left unlocked on purpose, and at the same time\ndisengaged the complicated envelopes and bandages by which he had been\nsuspended.It was some time ere Dwining's efforts succeeded; for, in\ndespite of the skill with which his machine had been constructed, the\nstraps designed to support the body had stretched so considerably as to\noccasion the sense of suffocation becoming extremely overpowering.But\nthe address of the surgeon triumphed over all obstacles; and, after\nsneezing and stretching himself, with one or two brief convulsions,\nBonthron gave decided proofs of reanimation, by arresting the hand\nof the operator as it was in the act of dropping strong waters on his\nbreast and throat, and, directing the bottle which contained them to his\nlips, he took, almost perforce, a considerable gulp of the contents.\"It is spiritual essence double distilled,\" said the astonished\noperator, \"and would blister the throat and burn the stomach of any\nother man.But this extraordinary beast is so unlike all other human\ncreatures, that I should not wonder if it brought him to the complete\npossession of his faculties.\"Bonthron seemed to confirm this: he started with a strong convulsion,\nsat up, stared around, and indicated some consciousness of existence.\"Wine--wine,\" were the first words which he articulated.The leech gave him a draught of medicated wine, mixed with water.He\nrejected it, under the dishonourable epithet of \"kennel washings,\" and\nagain uttered the words, \"Wine--wine.\"\"Nay, take it to thee, i' the devil's name,\" said the leech, \"since none\nbut he can judge of thy constitution.\"A draught, long and deep enough to have discomposed the intellects of\nany other person, was found effectual in recalling those of Bonthron to\na more perfect state; though he betrayed no recollection of where he was\nor what had befallen him, and in his brief and sullen manner asked why\nhe was brought to the river side at this time of night.\"Another frolic of the wild Prince, for drenching me as he did before.Nails and blood, but I would--\"\n\n\"Hold thy peace,\" interrupted Eviot, \"and be thankful, I pray you, if\nyou have any thankfulness in you, that thy body is not crow's meat and\nthy soul in a place where water is too scarce to duck thee.\"\"I begin to bethink me,\" said the ruffian; and raising the flask to his\nmouth, which he saluted with a long and hearty kiss, he set the empty\nbottle on the earth, dropped his head on his bosom, and seemed to muse\nfor the purpose of arranging his confused recollections.\"We can abide the issue of his meditations no longer,\" said Dwining; \"he\nwill be better after he has slept.you have been riding the air\nthese some hours; try if the water be not an easier mode of conveyance.I can no more lift this mass than I\ncould raise in my arms a slaughtered bull.\"\"Stand upright on thine own feet, Bonthron, now we have placed thee upon\nthem,\" said Eviot.\"Every drop of blood tingles in my\nveins as if it had pinpoints, and my knees refuse to bear their burden.This is some practice of thine,\nthou dog leech!\"\"Ay--ay, so it is, honest Bonthron,\" said Dwining--\"a practice thou\nshalt thank me for when thou comest to learn it.In the mean while,\nstretch down in the stern of that boat, and let me wrap this cloak about\nthee.\"Assisted into the boat accordingly, Bonthron was deposited there as\nconveniently as things admitted of.He answered their attentions with\none or two snorts resembling the grunt of a boar who has got some food\nparticularly agreeable to him.\"And now, Buncle,\" said the chirurgeon, \"your valiant squireship\nknows your charge.You are to carry this lively cargo by the river to\nNewburgh, where you are to dispose of him as you wot of; meantime,\nhere are his shackles and bandages, the marks of his confinement and\nliberation.Bind them up together, and fling them into the deepest pool\nyou pass over; for, found in your possession, they might tell tales\nagainst us all.This low, light breath of wind from the west will permit\nyou to use a sail as soon as the light comes in and you are tired of\nrowing.Your other valiancie, Master Page Eviot, must be content to\nreturn to Perth with me afoot, for here severs our fair company.Take\nwith thee the lantern, Buncle, for thou wilt require it more than we,\nand see thou send me back my flasket.\"As the pedestrians returned to Perth, Eviot expressed his belief that\nBonthron's understanding would never recover the shock which terror had\ninflicted upon it, and which appeared to him to have disturbed all the\nfaculties of his mind, and in particular his memory.\"It is not so, an it please your pagehood,\" said the leech.\"Bonthron's\nintellect, such as it is, hath a solid character: it Will but vacillate\nto and fro like a pendulum which hath been put in motion, and then will\nrest in its proper point of gravity.Our memory is, of all our powers of\nmind, that which is peculiarly liable to be suspended.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.Deep intoxication\nor sound sleep alike destroy it, and yet it returns when the drunkard\nbecomes sober or the sleeper is awakened.I knew at Paris a criminal condemned to die by the halter,\nwho suffered the sentence accordingly, showing no particular degree of\ntimidity upon the scaffold, and behaving and expressing himself as men\nin the same condition are wont to do.Accident did for him what a little\ningenious practice hath done for our amiable friend from whom we but\nnow parted.He was cut down and given to his friends before life was\nextinct, and I had the good fortune to restore him.But, though he\nrecovered in other particulars, he remembered but little of his trial\nand sentence.Of his confession on the morning of his execution--he!(in his usual chuckling manner)--he remembered him not a word.Neither of leaving the prison, nor of his passage to the Greve, where\nhe suffered, nor of the devout speeches with which he--he!he!--so many good Christians, nor of ascending the\nfatal tree, nor of taking the fatal leap, had my revenant the slightest\nrecollection.'But here we reach the point where we must separate;\nfor it were unfit, should we meet any of the watch, that we be found\ntogether, and it were also prudent that we enter the city by different\ngates.My profession forms an excuse for my going and coming at all\ntimes.Your valiant pagehood will make such explanation as may seem\nsufficing.\"\"I shall make my will a sufficient excuse if I am interrogated,\" said\nthe haughty young man.\"Yet I will avoid interruption, if possible.The\nmoon is quite obscured, and the road as black as a wolf's mouth.\"\"Tut,\" said the physicianer, \"let not your valour care for that: we\nshall tread darker paths ere it be long.\"Without inquiring into the meaning of these evil boding sentences, and\nindeed hardly listening to them in the pride and recklessness of his\nnature, the page of Ramorny parted from his ingenious and dangerous\ncompanion, and each took his own way.The course of true love never did run smooth.The ominous anxiety of our armourer had not played him false.When the\ngood glover parted with his intended son in law, after the judicial\ncombat had been decided, he found what he indeed had expected, that his\nfair daughter was in no favourable disposition towards her lover.But\nalthough he perceived that Catharine was cold, restrained, collected,\nhad cast away the appearance of mortal passion, and listened with a\nreserve, implying contempt, to the most splendid description he could\ngive her of the combat in the Skinners' Yards, he was determined not\nto take the least notice of her altered manner, but to speak of her\nmarriage with his son Henry as a thing which must of course take place.At length, when she began, as on a former occasion, to intimate that her\nattachment to the armourer did not exceed the bounds of friendship, that\nshe was resolved never to marry, that the pretended judicial combat\nwas a mockery of the divine will, and of human laws, the glover not\nunnaturally grew angry.\"I cannot read thy thoughts, wench; nor can I pretend to guess under\nwhat wicked delusion it is that you kiss a declared lover, suffer him\nto kiss you, run to his house when a report is spread of his death, and\nfling yourself into his arms when you find him alone [alive].All\nthis shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her parents in a match\nsanctioned by her father; but such tokens of intimacy, bestowed on one\nwhom a young woman cannot esteem, and is determined not to marry, are\nuncomely and unmaidenly.You have already been more bounteous of your\nfavours to Henry Smith than your mother, whom God assoilzie, ever was to\nme before I married her.I tell thee, Catharine, this trifling with the\nlove of an honest man is what I neither can, will, nor ought to endure.I have given my consent to the match, and I insist it shall take place\nwithout delay, and that you receive Henry Wynd tomorrow, as a man whose\nbride you are to be with all despatch.\"\"A power more potent than yours, father, will say no,\" replied\nCatharine.\"I will risk it; my power is a lawful one, that of a father over a\nchild, and an erring child,\" answered her father.\"God and man allow of\nmy influence.\"\"Then, may Heaven help us,\" said Catharine; \"for, if you are obstinate\nin your purpose, we are all lost.\"\"We can expect no help from Heaven,\" said the glover, \"when we act\nwith indiscretion.I am clerk enough myself to know that; and that your\ncauseless resistance to my will is sinful, every priest will inform\nyou.Ay, and more than that, you have spoken degradingly of the blessed\nappeal to God in the combat of ordeal.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the football.for the Holy Church\nis awakened to watch her sheepfold, and to extirpate heresy by fire and\nsteel;

but early on the next\nmorning, just at sun rising, Catharine knelt before the bed in which her\nparent still slumbered.Her heart sobbed as if it would burst, and her\ntears fell thick upon her father's face.The good old man awoke, looked\nup, crossed", "question": "Where is the football?

need not ask, my father, if you remember the Carthusian monk,\nClement, and his preachings and lessons; at which indeed you assisted so\noften, that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts,\nand with greater justice termed me so likewise?\"\"I am aware of both,\" said the old man, raising himself on his elbow;\n\"but I defy foul fame to show that I ever owned him in any heretical\nproposition, though I loved to hear him talk of the corruptions of the\nchurch, the misgovernment of the nobles, and the wild ignorance of\nthe poor, proving, as it seemed to me, that the sole virtue of our\ncommonweal, its strength and its estimation, lay among the burgher\ncraft of the better class, which I received as comfortable doctrine, and\ncreditable to the town.And if he preached other than right doctrine,\nwherefore did his superiors in the Carthusian convent permit it?If the\nshepherds turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the flock, they should\nnot blame the sheep for being worried.\"\"They endured his preaching, nay, they encouraged it,\" said Catharine,\n\"while the vices of the laity, the contentions of the nobles, and\nthe oppression of the poor were the subject of his censure, and they\nrejoiced in the crowds who, attracted to the Carthusian church,\nforsook those of the other convents.But the hypocrites--for such they\nare--joined with the other fraternities in accusing their preacher\nClement, when, passing from censuring the crimes of the state, he\nbegan to display the pride, ignorance, and luxury of the churchmen\nthemselves--their thirst of power, their usurpation over men's\nconsciences, and their desire to augment their worldly wealth.\"\"For God's sake, Catharine,\" said her father, \"speak within doors: your\nvoice rises in tone and your speech in bitterness, your eyes sparkle.It is owing to this zeal in what concerns you no more than others\nthat malicious persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous name of a\nheretic.\"\"You know I speak no more than what is truth,\" said Catharine, \"and\nwhich you yourself have avouched often.\"\"Wouldst\nthou have me avouch what might cost me life and limb, land and goods?For a full commission hath been granted for taking and trying heretics,\nupon whom is laid the cause of all late tumults and miscarriages;\nwherefore, few words are best,

spoken irreverent discourses of the doctrines of Holy Church.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.\"As I live by knife and needle,\" interrupted Simon, \"it is a lie!I\nnever was so silly as to speak of what I understood not.\"\"And hath slandered the anointed of the church, both regular and\nsecular,\" continued Catharine.\"Nay, I will never deny the truth,\" said the glover: \"an idle word I may\nhave spoken at the ale bench, or over a pottle pot of wine, or in right\nsure company; but else, my tongue is not one to run my head into peril.\"\"So you think, my dearest father; but your slightest language has been\nespied, your best meaning phrases have been perverted, and you are in\ndittay as a gross railer against church and churchmen, and for holding\ndiscourse against them with loose and profligate persons, such as the\ndeceased Oliver Proudfute, the smith Henry of the Wynd, and others, set\nforth as commending the doctrines of Father Clement, whom they charge\nwith seven rank heresies, and seek for with staff and spear, to try him\nto the death.But that,\" said Catharine, kneeling, and looking upwards\nwith the aspect of one of those beauteous saints whom the Catholics have\ngiven to the fine arts--\"that they shall never do.He hath escaped from\nthe net of the fowler; and, I thank Heaven, it was by my means.\"\"Thy means, girl--art thou mad?\"\"I will not deny what I glory in,\" answered Catharine: \"it was by my\nmeans that Conachar was led to come hither with a party of men and carry\noff the old man, who is now far beyond the Highland line.\"\"Thou my rash--my unlucky child!\"said the glover, \"hast dared to aid\nthe escape of one accused of heresy, and to invite Highlanders in arms\nto interfere with the administration of justice within burgh?thou hast offended both against the laws of the church and those of the\nrealm.What--what would become of us, were this known?\"\"It is known, my dear father,\" said the maiden, firmly--\"known even to\nthose who will be the most willing avengers of the deed.\"\"This must be some idle notion, Catharine, or some trick of those\ncogging priests and nuns; it accords not with thy late cheerful\nwillingness to wed Henry Smith.\"dearest father, remember the dismal surprise occasioned by his\nreported death, and the joyful amazement at finding him alive; and deem\nit not wonder if I permitted myself, under your protection, to say more\nthan my reflection justified.But then I knew not the worst, and thought\nthe danger exaggerated.Alas I was yesterday fearfully undeceived, when\nthe abbess herself came hither, and with her the Dominican.They showed\nme the commission, under the broad seal of Scotland, for inquiring into\nand punishing heresy; they showed me your name and my own in a list of\nsuspected persons; and it was with tears--real tears, that the abbess\nconjured me to avert a dreadful fate by a speedy retreat into the\ncloister, and that the monk pledged his word that you should not be\nmolested if I complied.\"\"The foul fiend take them both for weeping crocodiles!\"replied Catharine, \"complaint or anger will little help us; but\nyou see I have had real cause for this present alarm.\"my reckless child, where was your\nprudence when you ran headlong into such a snare?\"\"Hear me, father,\" said Catharine; \"there is still one mode of safety\nheld out: it is one which I have often proposed, and for which I have in\nvain supplicated your permission.\"\"I understand you--the convent,\" said her father.\"But, Catharine, what\nabbess or prioress would dare--\"\n\n\"That I will explain to you, father, and it will also show the\ncircumstances which have made me seem unsteady of resolution to a\ndegree which has brought censure upon me from yourself and others.Our\nconfessor, old Father Francis, whom I chose from the Dominican convent\nat your command--\"\n\n\"Ay, truly,\" interrupted the glover; \"and I so counselled and commanded\nthee, in order to take off the report that thy conscience was altogether\nunder the direction of Father Clement.\"\"Well, this Father Francis has at different times urged and provoked me\nto converse on such matters as he judged I was likely to learn something\nof from the Carthusian preacher.I fell\ninto the snare, spoke freely, and, as he argued gently, as one who would\nfain be convinced, I even spoke warmly in defence of what I believed\ndevoutly.The confessor assumed not his real aspect and betrayed not his\nsecret purpose until he had learned all that I had to tell him.It was\nthen that he threatened me with temporal punishment and with eternal\ncondemnation.Had his threats reached me alone, I could have stood firm;\nfor their cruelty on earth I could have endured, and their power beyond\nthis life I have no belief in.\"said the glover, who was well nigh beside himself\nat perceiving at every new word the increasing extremity of his\ndaughter's danger, \"beware of blaspheming the Holy Church, whose arms\nare as prompt to strike as her ears are sharp to hear.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.\"To me,\" said the Maid of Perth, again looking up, \"the terrors of the\nthreatened denunciations would have been of little avail; but when they\nspoke of involving thee, my father, in the charge against me, I own\nI trembled, and desired to compromise.The Abbess Martha, of Elcho\nnunnery, being my mother's kinswoman, I told her my distresses, and\nobtained her promise that she would receive me, if, renouncing worldly\nlove and thoughts of wedlock, I would take the veil in her sisterhood.She had conversation on the topic, I doubt not, with the Dominican\nFrancis, and both joined in singing the same song.\"'Remain in the world,' said they, 'and thy father and thou shall be\nbrought to trial as heretics; assume the veil, and the errors of both\nshall be forgiven and cancelled.'They spoke not even of recantation\nof errors of doctrine: all should be peace if I would but enter the\nconvent.\"\"I doubt not--I doubt not,\" said Simon: \"the old glover is thought rich,\nand his wealth would follow his daughter to the convent of Elcho, unless\nwhat the Dominicans might claim as their own share.So this was thy call\nto the veil, these thy objections to Henry Wynd?\"\"Indeed, father, the course was urged on all hands, nor did my own\nmind recoil from it.Sir John Ramorny threatened me with the powerful\nvengeance of the young Prince, if I continued to repel his wicked suit;\nand as for poor Henry, it is but of late that I have discovered, to\nmy own surprise--that--that I love his virtues more than I dislike his\nfaults.the discovery has only been made to render my quitting the\nworld more difficult than when I thought I had thee only to regret.\"She rested her head on her hand and wept bitterly.\"All this is folly,\" said the glover.\"Never was there an extremity so\npinching, but what a wise man might find counsel if he was

the other a lyre, which he plays with a plectrum.All the men\nhave beards, contrary to the custom of the Egyptians, but very general\nin the East at that period, and noticed as a peculiarity of foreign\nuncivilized nations throughout their sculptures.The men have sandals,\nthe women a sort of boot reaching to the ankle--both which were worn by\nmany Asiatic people.The lyre is rude, and

of Hebrew instruments which usually accompany historical\ntreatises on music and commentaries on the Bible, it ought to be borne\nin mind that most of them are merely the offspring of conjectures\nfounded on some obscure hints in the Bible, or vague accounts by the\nRabbins.THE SYRINX OR PANDEAN PIPE.Probably the _ugab_, which in the English\nauthorized version of the Bible is rendered \u201corgan.\u201d\n\nTHE BAGPIPE.The word _sumphonia_, which occurs in the book of\nDaniel, is, by Forkel and others, supposed to denote a bagpipe.It\nis remarkable that at the present day the bagpipe is called by the\nItalian peasantry Zampogna.Another Hebrew instrument, the _magrepha_,\ngenerally described as an organ, was more likely only a kind of\nbagpipe.The _magrepha_ is not mentioned in the Bible but is described\nin the Talmud.In tract Erachin it is recorded to have been a powerful\norgan which stood in the temple at Jerusalem, and consisted of a case\nor wind-chest, with ten holes, containing ten pipes.Each pipe was\ncapable of emitting ten different sounds, by means of finger-holes or\nsome similar contrivance: thus one hundred different sounds could be\nproduced on this instrument.Further, the _magrepha_ is said to have\nbeen provided with two pairs of bellows and with ten keys, by means of\nwhich it was played with the fingers.Its tone was, according to the\nRabbinic accounts, so loud that it could be heard at an incredibly long\ndistance from the temple.Authorities so widely differ that we must\nleave it uncertain whether the much-lauded _magrepha_ was a bagpipe,\nan organ, or a kettle-drum.Of the real nature of the Hebrew bagpipe\nperhaps some idea may be formed from a syrinx with bellows, which has\nbeen found represented on one of the ancient terra-cottas excavated in\nTarsus, Asia-minor, some years since, and here engraved.These remains\nare believed to be about 2000 years old, judging from the figures upon\nthem, and from some coins struck about 200 years B.C.We have therefore before us, probably, the oldest\nrepresentation of a bagpipe hitherto discovered.[Illustration]\n\nTHE TRUMPET.Three kinds are mentioned in the Bible, viz.the _keren_,\nthe _shophar_, and the _chatzozerah_.The first two were more or less\ncurved and might properly be considered as horns.Most commentators are\nof opinion that the _keren_--made of ram\u2019s horn--was almost identical\nwith the _shophar_, the only difference being that the latter was more\ncurved than the former.The _shophar_ is especially remarkable as being\nthe only Hebrew musical instrument which has been preserved to the\npresent day in the religious services of the Jews.It is still blown in\nthe synagogue, as in time of old, at the Jewish new-year\u2019s festival,\naccording to the command of Moses (Numb.The _chatzozerah_\nwas a straight trumpet, about two feet in length, and was sometimes\nmade of silver.Two of these straight trumpets are shown in the famous\ntriumphal procession after the fall of Jerusalem on the arch of Titus,\nengraved on the next page.There can be no doubt that the Hebrews had several kinds of\ndrums.We know, however, only of the _toph_, which appears to have\nbeen a tambourine or a small hand-drum like the Egyptian darabouka.In the English version of the Bible the word is rendered _timbrel_\nor _tabret_.This instrument was especially used in processions on\noccasions of rejoicing, and also frequently by females.We find it\nin the hands of Miriam, when she was celebrating with", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "There exists at the present day in the East a small hand-drum called\n_doff_, _diff_, or _adufe_--a name which appears to be synonymous with\nthe Hebrew _toph_.[Illustration]\n\nTHE SISTRUM.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.Winer, Saalfch\u00fctz, and several other commentators are of\nopinion that the _menaaneim_, mentioned in 2 Sam.In the English Bible the original is translated _cymbals_.The _tzeltzclim_, _metzilloth_, and _metzilthaim_, appear\nto have been cymbals or similar metallic instruments of percussion,\ndiffering in shape and sound.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.The little bells on the vestments of the high-priest were called\n_phaamon_.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Small golden bells were attached to the lower part of the\nrobes of the high-priest in his sacred ministrations.The Jews have, at\nthe present day, in their synagogues small bells fastened to the rolls\nof the Law containing the Pentateuch: a kind of ornamentation which is\nsupposed to have been in use from time immemorial.Besides the names of Hebrew instruments already given there occur\nseveral others in the Old Testament, upon the real meaning of which\nmuch diversity of opinion prevails._Jobel_ is by some commentators\nclassed with the trumpets, but it is by others believed to designate a\nloud and cheerful blast of the trumpet, used on particular occasions.If _Jobel_ (from which _jubilare_ is supposed to be derived) is\nidentical with the name _Jubal_, the inventor of musical instruments,\nit would appear that the Hebrews appreciated pre-eminently the\nexhilarating power of music._Shalisbim_ is supposed to denote a\ntriangle._Nechiloth_, _gittith_, and _machalath_, which occur in\nthe headings of some psalms, are also by commentators supposed to\nbe musical instruments._Nechiloth_ is said to have been a flute,\nand _gittith_ and _machalath_ to have been stringed instruments, and\n_machol_ a kind of flute.Again, others maintain that the words denote\npeculiar modes of performance or certain favourite melodies to which\nthe psalms were directed to be sung, or chanted.According to the\nrecords of the Rabbins, the Hebrews in the time of David and Solomon\npossessed thirty-six different musical instruments.In the Bible only\nabout half that number are mentioned.Most nations of antiquity ascribed the invention of their musical\ninstruments to their gods, or to certain superhuman beings.The Hebrews\nattributed it to man; Jubal is mentioned in Genesis as \u201cthe father of\nall such as handle the harp and organ\u201d (_i.e._, performers on stringed\ninstruments and wind instruments).<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.As instruments of percussion are\nalmost invariably in use long before people are led to construct\nstringed and wind instruments it might perhaps be surmised that Jubal\nwas not regarded as the inventor of all the Hebrew instruments, but\nrather as the first professional cultivator of instrumental music.Many musical instruments of the ancient Greeks are known to us by name;\nbut respecting their exact construction and capabilities there still\nprevails almost as much diversity of opinion as is the case with those\nof the Hebrews.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.It is generally believed that the Greeks derived their musical system\nfrom the Egyptians.Pythagoras and other philosophers are said to have\nstudied music in Egypt.It would, however, appear that the Egyptian\ninfluence upon Greece, as far as regards this art, has been overrated.Not only have the more perfect Egyptian instruments--such as the\nlarger harps, the tamboura--never been much in favour with the Greeks,\nbut almost all the stringed instruments which the Greeks possessed\nare stated to have been originally derived from Asia.Strabo says:\n\u201cThose who regard the whole of Asia, as far as India, as consecrated\nto Bacchus, point to that country as the origin of a great portion of\nthe present music.One author speaks of \u2018striking forcibly the Asiatic\nkithara,\u2019 another calls the pipes Berecynthian and Phrygian.Some of\nthe instruments also have foreign names, as Nabla, Sambuka, Barbiton,\nMagadis, and many others.\u201d\n\nWe know at present little more of these instruments than that they\nwere in use in Greece.Of the Magadis it is even not satisfactorily\nascertained whether it was a stringed or a wind instrument.The other\nthree are known to have been stringed instruments.But they cannot have\nbeen anything like such universal favourites as the lyre, because this\ninstrument and perhaps the _trigonon_ are almost the only stringed\ninstruments represented in the Greek paintings on pottery and other\nmonumental records.If, as might perhaps be suggested, their taste for\nbeauty of form induced the Greeks to represent the elegant lyre in\npreference to other stringed instruments, we might at least expect to\nmeet with the harp; an instrument which equals if it does not surpass\nthe lyre in elegance of form.[Illustration]\n\nThe representation of Polyhymnia with a harp, depicted on a splendid\nGreek vase now in the Munich museum, may be noted as an exceptional\ninstance.This valuable relic dates from the time of Alexander the\ngreat.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.The instrument resembles in construction as well as in shape\nthe Assyrian harp, and has thirteen strings.Polyhymnia is touching\nthem with both hands, using the right hand for the treble and the left\nfor the bass.She is seated, holding the instrument in her lap.Even\nthe little tuning-pegs, which in number are not in accordance with\nthe strings, are placed on the sound-board at the upper part of the\nframe, exactly as on the Assyrian harp.If then we have here the Greek\nharp, it was more likely an importation from Asia than from Egypt.In\nshort, as far as can be ascertained, the most complete of the Greek\ninstruments appear to be of Asiatic origin.Especially from the nations\nwho inhabited Asia-minor the Greeks are stated to have adopted several\nof the most popular.Thus we may read of the short and shrill-sounding\npipes of the Carians; of the Phrygian pastoral flute, consisting of\nseveral tubes united; of the three-stringed _kithara_ of the Lydians;\nand so on.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.The Greeks called the harp _kinyra_, and this may be the reason why in\nthe English translation of the Bible the _kinnor_ of the Hebrews, the\nfavourite instrument of king David, is rendered _harp_.[Illustration]\n\nThe Greeks had lyres of various kinds, shown in the accompanying\nwoodcuts, more or less differing in construction, form, and size, and\ndistinguished by different names; such as _lyra, ithara_, _chelys_,\n_phorminx_, etc._Lyra_ appears to have implied instruments of this\nclass in general, and also the lyre with a body oval at the base and\nheld upon the lap or in the arms of the performer; while the _kithara_\nhad a square base and was held against the breast.These distinctions\nhave, however, not been satisfactorily ascertained.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.The _chelys_ was a\nsmall lyre with the body made of the shell of a tortoise, or of wood in\nimitation of the tortoise.The _phorminx_ was a large lyre; and, like\nthe _kithara_, was used at an early period singly, for accompanying\nrecitations.It is recorded that the _kithara_ was employed for solo\nperformances as early as B.C.The design on the Grecian vase at Munich (already alluded to)\nrepresents the nine muses, of whom three are given in the engraving,\nviz., Polyhymnia with the harp, and Kalliope and Erato with lyres.It\nwill be observed that some of the lyres engraved in the woodcuts on\npage 29 are provided with a bridge, while others are without it.The\nlargest were held probably on or between the knees, or were attached\nto the left arm by means of a band, to enable the performer to use his\nhands without impediment.The strings, made of catgut or sinew, were\nmore usually twanged with a _plektron_ than merely with the fingers.The _plektron_ was a short stem of ivory or metal pointed at both ends.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.A fragment of a Greek lyre which was found in a tomb near Athens is\ndeposited in the British museum.The two pieces constituting its frame\nare of wood.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.Their length is about eighteen inches, and the length\nof the cross-bar at the top is about nine inches.The instrument is\nunhappily in a condition too dilapidated and imperfect to be of any\nessential use to the musical inquirer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.The _trigonon_ consisted originally of an angular frame, to which the\nstrings were affixed.In the course of time a third bar was added to\nresist the tension of the strings, and its triangular frame resembled\nin shape the Greek delta.Subsequently it was still further improved,\nthe upper bar of the frame being made slightly curved, whereby the\ninstrument obtained greater strength and more elegance of form.The _magadis_, also called _pektis_, had twenty strings which were\ntuned in octaves, and therefore produced only ten tones.It appears\nto have been some sort of dulcimer, but information respecting its\nconstruction is still wanting.There appears to have been also a\nkind of bagpipe in use called _magadis_, of which nothing certain is\nknown.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the apple.Possibly, the same name may have been applied to two different\ninstruments.[Illustration]\n\nThe _barbiton_ was likewise a stringed instrument of this kind.The\n_sambyke_ is traditionally said to have been invented by Ibykos, B.C.The _simmikon_ had thirty-five strings, and derived its name from\nits inventor, Simos, who lived about B.C.It was perhaps a kind of\ndulcimer.The _nabla_ had only two strings, and probably resembled the\n_nebel_ of the Hebrews, of which but little is known with certainty.The _pandoura_ is supposed to have been a kind of lute with three\nstrings.Several of the instruments just noticed were used in Greece,\nchiefly by musicians who had immigrated from Asia; they can therefore\nhardly be considered as national musical instruments of the Greeks.The\n_monochord_ had (as its name implies) only a single string, and was\nused in teaching singing and the laws of acoustics.[Illustration]\n\nThe flute, _aulos_, of which there were many varieties, as shown in\nthe woodcut p.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.31, was a highly popular instrument, and differed in\nconstruction from the flutes and pipes of the ancient Egyptians.Instead of being blown through a hole at the side near the top it was\nheld like a flageolet, and a vibrating reed was inserted into the\nmouth-piece, so that it might be more properly described as a kind\nof oboe or clarionet.The Greeks were accustomed to designate by the\nname of _aulos_ all wind instruments of the flute and oboe kind, some\nof which were constructed like the flageolet or like our antiquated\n_fl\u00fbte \u00e0 bec_.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.The single flute was called _monaulos_, and the double\none _diaulos_.A _diaulos_, which was found in a tomb at Athens, is in\nthe British museum.The wood of which it is made seems to be cedar,\nand the tubes are fifteen inches in length.Each tube has a separate\nmouth-piece and six finger-holes, five of which are at the upper side\nand one is underneath.The _syrinx_, or Pandean pipe, had from three to nine tubes, but seven\nwas the usual number.The straight trumpet, _salpinx_, and the curved\nhorn, _keras_, made of brass, were used exclusively in war.The small\nhand-drum, called _tympanon_, resembled in shape our tambourine, but\nwas covered with parchment at the back as well as at the front.The\n_kymbala_ were made of metal, and resembled our small cymbals.The\n_krotala_ were almost identical with our castanets, and were made of\nwood or metal.THE ETRUSCANS AND ROMANS.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.The Romans are recorded to have derived some of their most popular\ninstruments originally from the Etruscans; a people which at an early\nperiod excelled all other Italian nations in the cultivation of the\narts as well as in social refinement, and which possessed musical\ninstruments similar to those of the Greeks.It must, however, be\nremembered that many of the vases and other specimens of art which\nhave been found in Etruscan tombs, and on which delineations of lyres\nand other instruments occur, are supposed to be productions of Greek\nartists whose works were obtained from Greece by the Etruscans, or who\nwere induced to settle in Etruria.The flutes of the Etruscans were not unfrequently made of ivory;\nthose used in religious sacrifices were of box-wood, of a species of\nthe lotus, of ass\u2019 bone, bronze and silver.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.A bronze flute, somewhat\nresembling our flageolet, has been found in a tomb; likewise a huge\ntrumpet of bronze.An Etruscan _cornu_ (engraved) is deposited in the\nBritish museum, and measures about four feet in length.[Illustration]\n\nTo the Etruscans is also attributed by some the invention of the\nhydraulic organ.The Greeks possessed a somewhat similar contrivance\nwhich they called _hydraulos_, _i.e._ water-flute, and which probably\nwas identical with the _organum hydraulicum_ of the Romans.The\ninstrument ought more properly to be regarded as a pneumatic organ,\nfor the sound was produced by the current of air through the pipes;\nthe water applied serving merely to give the necessary pressure to the\nbellows and to regulate their action.The pipes were probably caused\nto sound by means of stops, perhaps resembling those on our organ,\nwhich were drawn out or pushed in.The construction was evidently but\na primitive contrivance, contained in a case which could be carried by\none or two persons and which was placed on a table.The highest degree\nof perfection which the hydraulic organ obtained with the ancients is\nperhaps shown in a representation on a coin of the emperor Nero, in\nthe British museum.Only ten pipes are given to it and there is no\nindication of any key board, which would probably have been shown had\nit existed.The man standing at the side and holding a laurel leaf in\nhis hand is surmised to represent a victor in the exhibitions of the\ncircus or the amphitheatre.The hydraulic organ probably was played on\nsuch occasions; and the medal containing an impression of it may have\nbeen bestowed upon the victor.[Illustration]\n\nDuring the time of the republic, and especially subsequently under\nthe reign of the emperors, the Romans adopted many new instruments\nfrom Greece, Egypt, and even from western Asia; without essentially\nimproving any of their importations.Their most favourite stringed instrument was the lyre, of which they\nhad various kinds, called, according to their form and arrangement\nof strings, _lyra_, _cithara_, _chelys_, _testudo_, _fidis_ (or\n_fides_), and _cornu_.The name _cornu_ was given to the lyre when the\nsides of the frame terminated at the top in the shape of two horns.The _barbitos_ was a kind of lyre with a large body, which gave the\ninstrument somewhat the shape of the Welsh _crwth_.The _psalterium_\nwas a kind of lyre of an oblong square shape.Like most of the Roman\nlyres, it was played with a rather large plectrum.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple.The _trigonum_ was\nthe same as the Greek _trigonon_, and was probably originally derived\nfrom", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "It is recorded that a certain musician of the name of\nAlexander Alexandrinus was so admirable a performer upon it that when\nexhibiting his skill in Rome he created the greatest _furore_.Less\ncommon, and derived from Asia, were the _sambuca_ and _nablia_, the\nexact construction of which is unknown.The flute, _tibia_, was originally made of the shin bone, and had a\nmouth-hole and four finger-holes.Its shape was retained even when,\nat a later period, it was constructed of other substances than bone.The _tibia gingrina_ consisted of a long and thin tube of reed with\na mouth-hole at the side of one end.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.The _tibia obliqua_ and _tibia\nvasca_ were provided with mouth-pieces affixed at a right angle to the\ntube; a contrivance somewhat similar to that on our bassoon.The _tibia\nlonga_ was especially used in religious worship.The _tibia curva_\nwas curved at its broadest end.The _tibia ligula_ appears to have\nresembled our flageolet.The _calamus_ was nothing more than a simple\npipe cut off the kind of reed which the ancients used as a pen for\nwriting.The Romans had double flutes as well as single flutes.The double flute\nconsisted of two tubes united, either so as to have a mouth-piece\nin common or to have each a separate mouth-piece.If the tubes were\nexactly alike the double flute was called _Tibi\u00e6 pares_; if they were\ndifferent from each other, _Tibi\u00e6 impares_.Little plugs, or stoppers,\nwere inserted into the finger-holes to regulate the order of intervals.The _tibia_ was made in various shapes.The _tibia dextra_ was usually\nconstructed of the upper and thinner part of a reed; and the _tibia\nsinistra_, of the lower and broader part.The performers used also the\n_capistrum_,--a bandage round the cheeks identical with the _phorbeia_\nof the Greeks.The British museum contains a mosaic figure of a Roman girl playing\nthe _tibia_, which is stated to have been disinterred in the year 1823\non the Via Appia.Here the _holmos_ or mouth-piece, somewhat resembling\nthe reed of our oboe, is distinctly shown.The finger-holes, probably\nfour, are not indicated, although they undoubtedly existed on the\ninstrument.[Illustration]\n\nFurthermore, the Romans had two kinds of Pandean pipes, viz.the\n_syrinx_ and the _fistula_.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.The bagpipe, _tibia utricularis_, is said\nto have been a favourite instrument of the emperor Nero.[Illustration]\n\nThe _cornu_ was a large horn of bronze, curved.The performer held\nit under his arm with the broad end upwards over his shoulder.It is\nrepresented in the engraving, with the _tuba_ and the _lituus_.The _tuba_ was a straight trumpet.Both the _cornu_ and the _tuba_\nwere employed in war to convey signals.The same was the case with the\n_buccina_,--originally perhaps a conch shell, and afterwards a simple\nhorn of an animal,--and the _lituus_, which was bent at the broad end\nbut otherwise straight.The _tympanum_ resembled the tambourine and was\nbeaten like the latter with the hands.Among the Roman instruments\nof percussion the _scabillum_, which consisted of two plates combined\nby means of a sort of hinge, deserves to be noticed; it was fastened\nunder the foot and trodden in time, to produce certain rhythmical\neffects in musical performances.The _cymbalum_ consisted of two metal\nplates similar to our cymbals.The _crotala_ and the _crusmata_ were\nkinds of castanets, the former being oblong and of a larger size than\nthe latter.The Romans had also a _triangulum_, which resembled the\ntriangle occasionally used in our orchestra.The _sistrum_ they derived\nfrom Egypt with the introduction of the worship of Isis.Metal bells,\narranged according to a regular order of intervals and placed in a\nframe, were called _tintinnabula_.The _crepitaculum_ appears to have\nbeen a somewhat similar contrivance on a hoop with a handle.Through the Greeks and Romans we have the first well-authenticated\nproof of musical instruments having been introduced into Europe from\nAsia.The Romans in their conquests undoubtedly made their musical\ninstruments known, to some extent, also in western Europe.But the\nGreeks and Romans are not the only nations which introduced eastern\ninstruments into Europe.The Ph\u0153nicians at an early period colonized\nSardinia, and traces of them are still to be found on that island.Among these is a peculiarly constructed double-pipe, called _lionedda_\nor _launedda_.Again, at a much later period the Arabs introduced\nseveral of their instruments into Spain, from which country they became\nknown in France, Germany, and England.Also the crusaders, during the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, may have helped to familiarize the\nwestern European nations with instruments of the east.Allowing for any exaggeration as to chronology, natural to the lively\nimagination of Asiatics, there is no reason to doubt that the Chinese\npossessed long before our Christian era musical instruments to which\nthey attribute a fabulously high antiquity.There is an ancient\ntradition, according to which they obtained their musical scale from\na miraculous bird, called foung-hoang, which appears to have been a\nsort of ph\u0153nix.When Confucius, who lived about B.C.500, happened to\nhear on a certain occasion some Chinese music, he became so greatly\nenraptured that he could not take any food for three months afterwards.The sounds which produced this effect were those of Kouei, the Orpheus\nof the Chinese, whose performance on the _king_--a kind of harmonicon\nconstructed of slabs of sonorous stone--would draw wild animals around\nhim and make them subservient to his will.As regards the invention of\nmusical instruments the Chinese have other traditions.In one of these\nwe are told that the origin of some of their most popular instruments\ndates from the period when China was under the dominion of heavenly\nspirits, called Ki.Another assigns the invention of several stringed\ninstruments to the great Fohi who was the founder of the empire and\nwho lived about B.C.3000, which was long after the dominion of the\nKi, or spirits.Again, another tradition holds that the most important\ninstruments and systematic arrangements of sounds are an invention of\nNiuva, a supernatural female, who lived at the time of Fohi.[Illustration]\n\nAccording to their records, the Chinese possessed their much-esteemed\n_king_ 2200 years before our Christian era, and employed it for\naccompanying songs of praise.During religious observances at the solemn moment when the _king_ was\nsounded sticks of incense were burnt.It was likewise played before\nthe emperor early in the morning when he awoke.The Chinese have long\nsince constructed various kinds of the _king_, one of which is here\nengraved, by using different species of stones.Their most famous stone\nselected for this purpose is called _yu_.It is not only very sonorous\nbut also beautiful in appearance.The _yu_ is found in mountain streams\nand crevices of rocks.The largest specimens found measure from two to\nthree feet in diameter, but of this size examples rarely occur.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.The\n_yu_ is very hard and heavy.Some European mineralogists, to whom the\nmissionaries transmitted specimens for examination, pronounce it to be\na species of agate.It is found of different colours, and the Chinese\nappear to have preferred in different centuries particular colours for\nthe _king_.The Chinese consider the _yu_ especially valuable for musical purposes,\nbecause it always retains exactly the same pitch.All other musical\ninstruments, they say, are in this respect doubtful; but the tone of\nthe _yu_ is neither influenced by cold nor heat, nor by humidity, nor\ndryness.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.The stones used for the _king_ have been cut from time to time in\nvarious grotesque shapes.Some represent animals: as, for instance, a\nbat with outstretched wings; or two fishes placed side by side: others\nare in the shape of an ancient Chinese bell.The angular shape shown\nin the engraving appears to be the oldest and is still retained in the\nornamented stones of the _pien-king_, which is a more modern instrument\nthan the _king_.The tones of the _pien-king_ are attuned according\nto the Chinese intervals called _lu_, of which there are twelve in\nthe compass of an octave.The same is the case with the other Chinese\ninstruments of this class.The pitch of\nthe _soung-king_, for instance, is four intervals lower than that of\nthe _pien-king_.Sonorous stones have always been used by the Chinese also singly, as\nrhythmical instruments.Such a single stone is called _tse-king_.Probably certain curious relics belonging to a temple in Peking,\nerected for the worship of Confucius, serve a similar purpose.In one\nof the outbuildings or the temple are ten sonorous stones, shaped like\ndrums, which are asserted to have been cut about three thousand years\nago.The primitive Chinese characters engraven upon them are nearly\nobliterated.The ancient Chinese had several kinds of bells, frequently arranged in\nsets so as to constitute a musical scale.The Chinese name for the bell\nis _tchung_.At an early period they had a somewhat square-shaped bell\ncalled _t\u00e9-tchung_.Like other ancient Chinese bells it was made of\ncopper alloyed with tin, the proportion being one pound of tin to six\nof copper.The _t\u00e9-tchung_, which is also known by the name of _piao_,\nwas principally used to indicate the time and divisions in musical\nperformances.It had a fixed pitch of sound, and several of these bells\nattuned to a certain order of intervals were not unfrequently ranged\nin a regular succession, thus forming a musical instrument which was\ncalled _pien-tchung_.The musical scale of the sixteen bells which\nthe _pien-tchung_ contained was the same as that of the _king_ before\nmentioned.[Illustration]\n\nThe _hiuen-tchung_ was, according to popular tradition, included with\nthe antique instruments at the time of Confucius, and came into popular\nuse during the Han dynasty (from B.C.It was of\na peculiar oval shape and had nearly the same quaint ornamentation\nas the _t\u00e9-tchung_; this consisted of symbolical figures, in four\ndivisions, each containing nine mammals.Every figure had a deep meaning referring to the seasons and to the\nmysteries of the Buddhist religion.The largest _hiuen-tchung_ was\nabout twenty inches in length; and, like the _t\u00e9-tchung_, was sounded\nby means of a small wooden mallet with an oval knob.None of the bells\nof this description had a clapper.It would, however, appear that the\nChinese had at an early period some kind of bell provided with a wooden\ntongue: this was used for military purposes as well as for calling the\npeople together when an imperial messenger promulgated his sovereign\u2019s\ncommands.An expression of Confucius is recorded to the effect that\nhe wished to be \u201cA wooden-tongued bell of Heaven,\u201d _i.e._ a herald of\nheaven to proclaim the divine purposes to the multitude.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.[Illustration]\n\nThe _fang-hiang_ was a kind of wood-harmonicon.It contained sixteen\nwooden slabs of an oblong square shape, suspended in a wooden frame\nelegantly decorated.The slabs were arranged in two tiers, one above\nthe other, and were all of equal length and breadth but differed in\nthickness.The _tchoung-tou_ consisted of twelve slips of bamboo, and\nwas used for beating time and for rhythmical purposes.The slips being\nbanded together at one end could be expanded somewhat like a fan.The\nChinese state that they used the _tchoung-tou_ for writing upon before\nthey invented paper.The _ou_, of which we give a woodcut, likewise an ancient Chinese\ninstrument of percussion and still in use, is made of wood in the shape\nof a crouching tiger.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.It is hollow, and along its back are about twenty\nsmall pieces of metal, pointed, and in appearance not unlike the teeth\nof a saw.The performer strikes them with a sort of plectrum resembling\na brush, or with a small stick called _tchen_.Occasionally the _ou_ is\nmade with pieces of metal shaped like reeds.[Illustration]\n\nThe ancient _ou_ was constructed with only six tones which were\nattuned thus--_f_, _g_, _a_, _c_, _d_, _f_.The instrument appears\nto have become deteriorated in the course of time; for, although\nit has gradually acquired as many as twenty-seven pieces of metal,\nit evidently serves at the present day more for the production of\nrhythmical noise than for the execution of any melody.The modern _ou_\nis made of a species of wood called _kieou_ or _tsieou_: and the tiger\nrests generally on a hollow wooden pedestal about three feet six inches\nlong, which serves as a sound-board.[Illustration]\n\nThe _tchou_, likewise an instrument of percussion, was made of the\nwood of a tree called _kieou-mou_, the stem of which resembles that of\nthe pine and whose foliage is much like that of the cypress.It was\nconstructed of boards about three-quarters of an inch in thickness.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.In\nthe middle of one of the sides was an aperture into which the hand was\npassed for the purpose of holding the handle of a wooden hammer, the\nend of which entered into a hole situated in the bottom of the _tchou_.The handle was kept in its place by means of a wooden pin, on which it\nmoved right and left when the instrument was struck with a hammer.The\nChinese ascribe to the _tchou_ a very high antiquity, as they almost\ninvariably do with any of their inventions when the date of its origin\nis unknown to them.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.The _po-fou_ was a drum, about one foot four inches in length, and\nseven inches in diameter.It had a parchment at each end, which was\nprepared in a peculiar way by being boiled in water.The _po-fou_ used\nto be partly filled with a preparation made from the husk of rice, in\norder to mellow the sound.The Chinese name for the drum is _kou_.[Illustration]\n\nThe _kin-kou_ (engraved), a large drum fixed on a pedestal which raises\nit above six feet from the ground, is embellished with symbolical\ndesigns.A similar drum on which natural phenomena are depicted is\ncalled _lei-kou_; and another of the kind, with figures of certain\nbirds and beasts which are regarded as symbols of long life, is called\n_ling-kou_, and also _lou-kou_.The flutes, _ty_, _yo_, and _tch\u00e9_ were generally made of bamboo.The\n_koan-tsee_ was a Pandean pipe containing twelve tubes of bamboo.The _siao_, likewise a Pandean pipe, contained sixteen tubes.The\n_pai-siao_ differed from the _siao_ inasmuch as the tubes were inserted\ninto an oddly-shaped case highly ornamented with grotesque designs and\nsilken appendages.[Illustration]\n\nThe Chinese are known to have constructed at an early period a curious\nwind-instrument, called _hiuen_.It was made of baked clay and had five\nfinger-holes, three of which were placed on one side and two on the\nopposite side, as in the cut.Its tones were in conformity with the\npentatonic scale.The reader unacquainted with the pentatonic scale may\nascertain its character by playing on the pianoforte the scale of C\nmajor with the omission of _f_ and _b_ (the _fourth_ and _seventh_); or\nby striking the black keys in regular succession from _f_-sharp to the\nnext _f_-sharp above or below.Another curious wind", "question": "Where is the apple?

could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord\nHinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in\ntheir way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's\nbedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of\nthe L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will\nnot do it to my Lord's

Let us look before us and not behind.\"The immediate object of General Pope was to make the capital secure, to\nmake advances toward Richmond, and, if possible, to draw a portion of\nLee's army away from McClellan.From\nthis town, not far from the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, there was a\nrailroad connecting it with Richmond--a convenient means of furnishing men\nand supplies to the Confederate army.Pope decided to occupy the town and\ndestroy the railroad.To this end he ordered Banks to Culpeper and thence\nto send all his cavalry to Gordonsville, capture the town and tear up ten\nor fifteen miles of the railroad in the direction of Richmond.But, as if\na prelude to the series of defeats which General Pope was to suffer in the\nnext six weeks, he failed in this initial movement.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.The sagacious Lee had\ndivined his intention and had sent General \"Stonewall\" Jackson with his\nand General Ewell's divisions on July 13th, to occupy Gordonsville.Ewell\narrived in advance of Jackson and held the town for the Confederates.In the campaign we are describing Jackson was the most active and\nconspicuous figure on the Confederate side.He rested at Gordonsville for\ntwo weeks, recuperating his health and that of the army, which had been\nmuch impaired in the malarial district of the Peninsula.The fresh\nmountain air blowing down from the Blue Ridge soon brought back their\nwonted vigor.On July 27th A. P. Hill was ordered to join him, and the\nConfederate leader now had about twenty-five thousand men.The movement on Gordonsville was exactly in accordance with Jackson's own\nideas which he had urged upon Lee.Although believing McClellan to be in\nan impregnable position on the Peninsula, it was not less evident to him\nthat the Union general would be unable to move further until his army had\nbeen reorganized and reenforced.This was the moment, he argued, to strike\nin another direction and carry the conflict into the Federal territory.An\narmy of at least sixty thousand should march into Maryland and appear\nbefore the National Capital.President Davis could not be won over to the\nplan while McClellan was still in a position to be reenforced by sea, but\nLee, seeing that McClellan remained inactive, had determined, by sending\nJackson westward, to repeat the successful tactics of the previous spring\nin the Shenandoah valley.Such a move might result in the recall of\nMcClellan.No sooner had Halleck assumed command of all the\nNorthern armies than the matter of McClellan's withdrawal was agitated and\non August 3d the head of the Army of the Potomac, to his bitter\ndisappointment, was ordered to join Pope on the Rappahannock.Halleck was\nmuch concerned as to how Lee would act during the Federal evacuation of\nthe Peninsula, uncertain whether the Confederates would attempt to crush\nPope before McClellan could reenforce him, or whether McClellan would be\nattacked as soon as he was out of his strong entrenchments at Harrison's\nLanding.The latter of the two possibilities seemed the more probable, and Pope was\ntherefore ordered to push his whole army toward Gordonsville, in the hope\nthat Lee, compelled to strengthen Jackson, would be too weak to fall upon\nthe retiring Army of the Potomac.The Union army now occupied the great triangle formed roughly by the\nRappahannock and the Rapidan rivers and the range of the Blue Ridge\nMountains, with Culpeper Court House as the rallying point.Pope soon\nfound that the capturing of New Madrid and Island No.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.10 was easy in\ncomparison with measuring swords with the Confederate generals in the\nEast.On August 6th Pope began his general advance upon Gordonsville.Banks\nalready had a brigade at Culpeper Court House, and this was nearest to\nJackson.The small settlement was the meeting place of four roads by means\nof which Pope's army of forty-seven thousand men would be united.Jackson,\ninformed of the advance, immediately set his three divisions in motion for\nCulpeper, hoping to crush Banks, hold the town, and prevent the uniting of\nthe Army of Virginia.The remainder of Banks's\ncorps reached Culpeper on the 8th.On the morning of the 9th Jackson\nfinally got his troops over the Rapidan and the Robertson rivers.Two\nmiles beyond the latter stream there rose from the plain the <DW72> of\nSlaughter Mountain, whose ominous name is more often changed into Cedar.This \"mountain\" is an isolated foothill of the Blue Ridge, some twenty\nmiles from the parent range, and a little north of the Rapidan.From its\nsummit could be seen vast stretches of quiet farmlands which had borne\ntheir annual harvests since the days of the Cavaliers.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.Its gentle <DW72>s\nwere covered with forests, which merged at length into waving grain fields\nand pasture lands, dotted here and there with rural homes.It was here on\nthe <DW72> of Cedar Mountain that one of the most severe little battles of\nthe war took place.On the banks of Cedar Run, seven miles south of Culpeper and but one or\ntwo north of the mountain, Banks's cavalry were waiting to oppose\nJackson's advance.Learning of this the latter halted and waited for an\nattack.He placed Ewell's batteries on the <DW72> about two hundred feet\nabove the valley and sent General Winder to take a strong position on the\nleft.So admirably was Jackson's army stationed that it would have\nrequired a much larger force, approaching it from the plains, to dislodge\nit.And yet, General Banks made an attempt with an army scarcely one-third\nas large as that of Jackson.General Pope had made glowing promises of certain success and he well knew\nthat the whole North was eagerly watching and waiting for him to fulfil\nthem.He must strike somewhere and do it soon--and here was his chance at\nCedar Mountain.He sent Banks with nearly eight thousand men against this\nbrilliant Southern commander with an army three times as large, holding a\nstrong position on a mountain side.Banks with his infantry left Culpeper Court House on the morning of August\n9th and reached the Confederate stronghold in the afternoon.He approached\nthe mountain through open fields in full range of the Confederate cannon,\nwhich presently opened with the roar of thunder.All heedless of danger\nthe brave men ran up the <DW72> as if to take the foe by storm, when\nsuddenly they met a brigade of Ewell's division face to face and a brief,\ndeadly encounter took place.In a few minutes the Confederate right flank\nbegan to waver and would no doubt have been routed but for the timely aid\nof another brigade and still another that rushed down the hill and opened\nfire on the Federal lines which extended along the eastern bank of Cedar\nRun.Meanwhile the Union batteries had been wheeled into position and their\ndeep roar answered that of the foe on the hill.For two or three hours the\nbattle continued with the utmost fury.The ground was strewn with dead and\ndying and human blood was poured out like water.But the odds were too\ngreat and at length, as the shades of evening were settling over the gory\nfield, Banks began to withdraw the remnant of his troops.But he left two\nthousand of his brave lads--one fourth of his whole army--dead or dying\nalong the hillside, while the Confederate losses were in excess of\nthirteen hundred.The dead and wounded of both armies lay mingled in masses over the whole\nbattle-field.While the fighting continued, neither side could send aid or\nrelief to the maimed soldiers, who suffered terribly from thirst and lack\nof attention as the sultry day gave place to a close, oppressive night.General Pope had remained at Culpeper, but, hearing the continuous\ncannonading and knowing that a sharp engagement was going on, hastened to\nthe battle-field in the afternoon with a fresh body of troops under\nGeneral Ricketts, arriving just before dark.He instantly ordered Banks to\nwithdraw his right wing so as to make room for Ricketts; but the\nConfederates, victorious as they had been, refused to continue the contest\nagainst the reenforcements and withdrew to the woods up the mountain side.Heavy shelling was kept up by the hard-worked artillerymen of both armies\nuntil nearly midnight, while the Federal troops rested on their arms in\nline of battle.For two days the armies faced each other across the\nvalley.Pope's first battle as leader of an\nEastern army had resulted in neither victory nor defeat.[Illustration: A

E. B. Stuart, the daring Southern cavalry leader, and \"Stonewall\"\nJackson.Before relating these\nincidents, however, we must take a general view of the field.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.General\nPope's headquarters at this moment were at Culpeper, with a large part of\nhis army, but he had left much of his personal baggage and many of his\nprivate papers at Catlett's, a station on the Orange and Alexandria\nRailroad between Culpeper and Manassas Junction, while his vast store of\narmy supplies was at the latter place.Pope's great source of uncertainty lay in the fact that he did not know\nwhether Lee would move against him or would follow McClellan in the\nlatter's retreat from the Peninsula; nor did he know when the\nreenforcements promised from McClellan's army would reach him.Meanwhile\nLee had decided to let McClellan depart in peace and to advance against\nPope, with the whole Confederate army.To this end Longstreet was ordered\nto the scene and with his corps he reached Gordonsville on August 13th.A few days later the two Confederate generals, Lee and Longstreet,\nascended to the top of Clark's Mountain, from which, through powerful\nfield-glasses, they obtained a good view of Culpeper, about twelve miles\naway.They saw that Pope's position was weak and determined to attack him\nwithout delay.Lee ordered his army to cross the Rapidan.He also sent a\ncourier to gallop across the country with an important dispatch to General\nStuart, disclosing his plans.It was now that General Pope met fortune; he\ncaptured the courier and learned of Lee's plans.Pope knew that he was not\nin position to meet Lee's army at Culpeper, and he withdrew from that\nplace and took up a strong position behind the Rappahannock.Lee had\nstrained every nerve to get at his antagonist before the latter left\nCulpeper and before he could be reenforced by McClellan's army.But sudden\nrains changed the Rappahannock from a placid stream into a rushing\ntorrent.The Confederates were delayed and meantime the reenforcements\nfrom the Peninsula began to reach Pope's army.General Reno with a part of\nBurnside's corps was on the ground by August 14th.One week later came\nGenerals Kearny and Reynolds--both splendid leaders, both destined to give\ntheir lives for their country within a year--to join the Army of Virginia\nwith some thousands of additional fighters from the Army of the Potomac.Lee was completely thwarted in his purpose of attacking Pope before his\nreenforcements arrived.He sent the dauntless cavalry\nleader, J. E. B. Stuart, to make a raid around the Union army.Stuart did\nthis effectively, and this was the first of the two notable events of\nthese weeks of sparring.Crossing the Rappahannock at Waterloo Bridge with\nfifteen hundred mounted men as bold and dauntless as himself, Stuart\ndashed up the country, riding all day and all night.After the coming of\nnight on the evening of the 22d, in the midst of a torrential rainstorm,\nwhile the darkness was so intense that every man was guided by the tread\nof his brother horsemen, Stuart pounced upon the Federals near Catlett's\nStation, overpowered the astonished guard, captured nearly two hundred\nprisoners, scattering the remainder of the troops stationed there far and\nwide in the darkness, and seized Pope's despatch-book with his plans and\nprivate papers.Stuart took also several hundred fine horses and burned a\nlarge number of wagons laden with supplies.Among his trophies was a fine\nuniform cloak and hat which were the personal

had\nreached their ears from the valley of the Rapidan.Now here was a real\narmy at their very doors.Nor was it a hostile army, for their sympathies\nwere Southern.With baskets and armfuls of bread and pies and cakes they\ncheered as best they could the tattered and hungry men on the march.General Lee in the meantime had kept Longstreet in front of Pope's army on\nthe Rappahannock to make daily demonstrations and feints and thus to\ndivert Pope's attention from Jackson's movements and lead him to believe\nthat he was to be attacked in front.\"Stonewall\" Jackson suddenly, on August 26th,

great, including three hundred prisoners, one\nhundred and seventy-five horses, ten locomotives, seven long trains of\nprovisions, and vast stores and munitions of war.Next morning the weary and

the Confederate force by more than seven\nhundred.Kernstown was a Union victory; yet never in history did victory\nbring such ultimate disaster upon the victors.At Washington the alarm was intense over Jackson's audacious attack.Williams' division of Banks' troops was halted on its way to Manassas and\nsent back to Winchester.Lincoln transferred Blenker's division, nine\nthousand strong, to Fremont.These things were done at once, but they were\nby no means the most momentous consequence of Kernstown.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.The President\nbegan to fear that Jackson's goal was Washington.After consulting six of\nhis generals he became convinced that McClellan had not arranged proper\nprotection for the city.Therefore, McDowell and his corps of thirty-seven\nthousand men were ordered to remain at Manassas.The Valley grew to\ngreater importance in the Federal eyes.Banks was made entirely\nindependent of McClellan and the defense of this region became his sole\ntask.McClellan, to his great chagrin, saw his force depleted by forty-six\nthousand men.There were now four Union generals in the East operating\nindependently one of the other.General Ewell with eight thousand troops on the upper Rappahannock and\nGeneral Johnson with two brigades were now ordered to cooperate with\nJackson.Schenck and Milroy, of\nFremont's corps, began to threaten Johnson.Banks, with twenty thousand,\nwas near Harrisonburg.The Confederate leader left General Ewell to watch Banks while he made a\ndash for Milroy and Schenck.He fought them at McDowell on May 8th and\nthey fled precipitately to rejoin Fremont.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.The swift-acting Jackson now\ndarted at Banks, who had fortified himself at Strasburg.Jackson stopped\nlong enough to be joined by Ewell.He did not attack Strasburg, but stole\nacross the Massanutten Mountain unknown to Banks, and made for Front\nRoyal, where a strong Union detachment was stationed under Colonel Kenly.Early on the afternoon of May 23d, Ewell rushed from the forest.Kenly and\nhis men fled before them toward Winchester.A large number were captured\nby the cavalry before they had gotten more than four miles away.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football.Banks at Strasburg realized that Jackson was approaching from the rear,\nthe thing he had least expected and had made no provision for.There was nothing to be done but\nretreat to Winchester.Even that was prevented by the remarkable speed of\nJackson's men, who could march as much as thirty-five miles a day.On May\n24th, the Confederates overtook and struck the receding Union flank near\nNewtown, inflicting heavy loss and taking many prisoners.Altogether,\nthree thousand of Banks' men fell into Jackson's hands.This exploit was most opportune for the Southern arms.It caused the final\nruin of McClellan's hopes.Banks received one more attack from Ewell's\ndivision the next day as he passed through Winchester on his way to the\nshelter of the Potomac.He crossed at Williamsport late the same evening\nand wrote the President that his losses, though serious enough, might have\nbeen far worse \"considering the very great disparity of forces engaged,\nand the long-matured plans of the enemy, which aimed at nothing less than\nentire capture of our force.\"Lincoln now rescinded his resolution to\nsend McDowell to McClellan.Instead, he transferred twenty thousand of the\nformer's men to Fremont and informed McClellan that he was not, after all,\nto have the aid of McDowell's forty thousand men.Fremont was coming from the west; Shields lay in the other direction, but\nJackson was not the man to be trapped.He managed to hold Fremont while he\nmarched his main force quickly up the Valley.At Port Republic he drove\nCarroll's brigade of Shields' division away and took possession of a\nbridge which Colonel Carroll had neglected to burn.Fremont in pursuit was\ndefeated by Ewell at Cross Keys.Jackson immediately put his force of\ntwelve thousand over the Shenandoah at Port Republic and burned the\nbridge.Safe from the immediate attack by Fremont, he fell upon Tyler and\nCarroll, who had not more than three thousand men between them.The\nFederals made a brave stand, but after many hours' fighting were compelled\nto retreat.Jackson emerged through Swift Run Gap on the 17th of June, to", "question": "Where is the football?

approaching the station.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.The engineer, taking in the\nsituation at a glance, put on a full head of steam and made a rush for the\nobstruction, which was easily brushed aside.As the train went through a\ncut the Confederates fired upon it, wounding and killing some of the\nFederal soldiers in the cars.Riding all through a moonlit night, the raiders reached Sycamore Ford of\nthe Chickahominy at break of day.As usual this erratic stream was\noverflowing its banks.They started to ford it, but finding that it would\nbe a long and wearisome task, a bridge was hastily improvised at another\nplace where the passage was made with more celerity.Now, on the south\nbank of the river, haste was made for the confines of Richmond, where, at\ndawn of the following day, the troopers dropped from their saddles, a\nweary but happy body of cavalry.Lee thus obtained exact and detailed information of the position of\nMcClellan's army, and he laid out his campaign accordingly.Meanwhile his\nown forces in and about Richmond were steadily increasing.He was planning\nfor an army of nearly one hundred thousand and he now demonstrated his\nability as a strategist.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.Word had been despatched to Jackson in the\nShenandoah to bring his troops to fall upon the right wing of McClellan's\narmy.At the same time Lee sent General Whiting north to make a feint of\njoining Jackson and moving upon Washington.The authorities at Washington were frightened, and McClellan\nreceived no more reenforcements.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.Jackson now began a hide-and-seek game\namong the mountains, and managed to have rumors spread of his army being\nin several places at the same time, while skilfully veiling his actual\nmovements.It was not until the 25th of June that McClellan had definite knowledge of\nJackson's whereabouts.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football there.He was then located at Ashland, north of the\nChickahominy, within striking distance of the Army of the Potomac.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.McClellan was surprised but he was not unprepared.Seven days before he\nhad arranged for a new base of supplies on the James, which would now\nprove useful if he were driven south of the Chickahominy.On the very day he heard of Jackson's arrival at Ashland, McClellan was\npushing his men forward to begin his siege of Richmond--that variety of\nwarfare which his engineering soul loved so well.His advance guard was\nwithin four miles of the Confederate capital.His strong fortifications\nwere bristling upon every vantage point, and his fond hope was that within\na few days, at most, his efficient artillery, for which the Army of the\nPotomac was famous, would be belching forth its sheets of fire and lead\ninto the beleagured city.In front of the Union encampment, near Fair\nOaks, was a thick entanglement of scrubby pines, vines, and ragged bushes,\nfull of ponds and marshes.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.This strip of woodland was less than five\nhundred yards wide.Beyond it was an open field half a mile in width.The\nUnion soldiers pressed through the thicket to see what was on the other\nside and met the Confederate pickets among the trees.Upon emerging into the open, the Federal troops found it\nfilled with rifle-pits, earthworks, and redoubts.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the football.At once they were met\nwith a steady and incessant fire, which continued from eight in the\nmorning until five in the afternoon.At times the contest almost reached\nthe magnitude of a battle, and in the end the Union forces occupied the\nformer position of their antagonists.This passage of arms, sometimes\ncalled the affair of Oak Grove or the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, was the\nprelude to the Seven Days' Battles.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the football there.The following day, June 26th, had been set by General \"Stonewall\" Jackson\nas the date on which he would join Lee, and together they would fall upon\nthe right wing of the Army of the Potomac.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.The Federals north of the\nChickahominy were under the direct command of General Fitz John Porter.Defensive preparations had been made on an extensive scale.Field works,\nheavily armed with artillery, and rifle-pits, well manned, covered the\nroads and open fields and were often concealed by timber from the eye of\nthe opposing army.The extreme right of the Union line lay near\nMechanicsville on the upper Chickahominy.A tributary of this stream from\nthe north was Beaver Dam Creek, upon whose left bank was a steep bluff,\ncommanding the valley to the west.This naturally strong position, now\nwell defended, was almost impregnable to an attack from the front.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.Before sunrise of the appointed day the Confederate forces were at the\nChickahominy bridges, awaiting the arrival of Jackson.To reach these some\nof the regiments had marched the greater part of the night.Noon passed and\nJackson had not arrived.At three o'clock, General A. P. Hill, growing\nimpatient, decided to put his troops in motion.Crossing at Meadow Bridge,\nhe marched his men along the north side of the Chickahominy, and at\nMechanicsville was joined by the commands of Longstreet and D. H. Hill.Driving the Union outposts to cover, the Confederates swept across the low\napproach to Beaver Dam Creek.A murderous fire from the batteries on the\ncliff poured into their ranks.Gallantly the attacking columns withstood\nthe deluge of leaden hail and drew near the creek.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.A few of the more\naggressive reached the opposite bank but their repulse was severe.Later in the afternoon relief was sent to Hill, who again attempted to\nforce the Union position at Ellerson's Mill, where the <DW72> of the west\nbank came close to the borders of the little stream.From across the open\nfields, in full view of the defenders of the cliff, the Confederates moved\ndown the <DW72>.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.They were in range of the Federal batteries, but the fire\nwas reserved.Every artilleryman was at his post ready to fire at the\nword; the soldiers were in the rifle-pits sighting along the glittering\nbarrels of their muskets with fingers on the triggers.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.As the approaching\ncolumns reached the stream they turned with the road that ran parallel to\nthe bank.From every waiting field-piece the shells came screaming through the air.Volley after volley of musketry was poured into the flanks of the marching\nSoutherners.The hillside was soon covered with the victims of the", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "Twilight fell upon the warring troops and there were no signs of a\ncessation of the unequal combat.Night fell, and still from the heights\nthe lurid flames burst in a display of glorious pyrotechnics.It was nine\no'clock when Hill finally drew back his shattered regiments, to await the\ncoming of the morning.The Forty-fourth Georgia regiment suffered most in\nthe fight; three hundred and thirty-five being the dreadful toll, in dead\nand wounded, paid for its efforts to break down the Union position.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.Dropping back to the rear this ill-fated regiment attempted to re-form its\nbroken ranks, but its officers were all among those who had fallen.Both\narmies now prepared for another day and a renewal of the conflict.Her face was strange to me,\" he solemnly proceeded, \"but I can give you\neach and every detail of it, as, bending above me, she stared into my\neyes with a growing terror that seemed to implore help, though her lips\nwere quiet, and only the memory of that cry echoed in my ears.\"\"It was a round, fair, lady's face.Very lovely in contour, but devoid\nof coloring; not beautiful, but winning from its childlike look of\ntrust.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.The hair, banded upon the low, broad forehead, was brown; the\neyes, which were very far apart, gray; the mouth, which was its most\ncharming feature, delicate of make and very expressive.There was\na dimple in the chin, but none in the cheeks.It was a face to be\nremembered.\"\"Meeting the gaze of those imploring eyes, I started up.Instantly the\nface and all vanished, and I became conscious, as we sometimes do in\ndreams, of a certain movement in the hall below, and the next instant\nthe gliding figure of a man of imposing size entered the library.I remember experiencing a certain thrill at this, half terror, half\ncuriosity, though I seemed to know, as if by intuition, what he was\ngoing to do.Strange to say, I now seemed to change my personality,\nand to be no longer a third party watching these proceedings, but Mr.Leavenworth himself, sitting at his library table and feeling his doom\ncrawling upon him without capacity for speech or power of movement to\navert it.Though my back was towards the man, I could feel his stealthy\nform traverse the passage, enter the room beyond, pass to that stand\nwhere the pistol was, try the drawer, find it locked, turn the key,\nprocure the pistol, weigh it in an accustomed hand, and advance again.I could feel each footstep he took as though his feet were in truth upon\nmy heart, and I remember staring at the table before me as if I expected\nevery moment to see it run with my own blood.I can see now how the\nletters I had been writing danced upon the paper before me, appearing\nto my eyes to take the phantom shapes of persons and things long ago\nforgotten; crowding my last moments with regrets and dead shames, wild\nlongings, and unspeakable agonies, through all of which that face, the\nface of my former dream, mingled, pale, sweet, and searching, while\ncloser and closer behind me crept that noiseless foot till I could\nfeel the glaring of the assassin's eyes across the narrow threshold\nseparating me from death and hear the click of his teeth as he set his\nlips for the final act.and the secretary's livid face showed the\ntouch of awful horror, \"what words can describe such an experience as\nthat?In one moment, all the agonies of hell in the heart and brain,\nthe next a blank through which I seemed to see afar, and as if suddenly\nremoved from all this, a crouching figure looking at its work with\nstarting eyes and pallid back-drawn lips; and seeing, recognize no face\nthat I had ever known, but one so handsome, so remarkable, so unique in\nits formation and character, that it would be as easy for me to mistake\nthe countenance of my father as the look and figure of the man revealed\nto me in my dream.\"said I, in a voice I failed to recognize as my own.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.\"Was that of him whom we saw leave Mary Leavenworth's presence last\nnight and go down the hall to the front door.\"A PREJUDICE\n\n\n    \"True, I talk of dreams,\n     Which are the children of an idle brain\n     Begot of nothing but vain phantasy.\"FOR one moment I sat a prey to superstitious horror; then, my natural\nincredulity asserting itself, I looked up and remarked:\n\n\"You say that all this took place the night previous to the actual\noccurrence?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.\"But you did not seem to take it as such?\"I thought but little of it in a\nsuperstitious way till I looked next day upon Mr.\"I do not wonder you behaved strangely at the inquest.\"\"Ah, sir,\" he returned, with a slow, sad smile; \"no one knows what\nI suffered in my endeavors not to tell more than I actually knew,\nirrespective of my dream, of this murder and the manner of its\naccomplishment.\"\"You believe, then, that your dream foreshadowed the manner of the\nmurder as well as the fact?\"\"It is a pity it did not go a little further, then, and tell us how\nthe assassin escaped from, if not how he entered, a house so securely\nfastened.\"\"Also, if I had been informed where Hannah was, and why a stranger and a\ngentleman should have stooped to the committal of such a crime.\"Seeing that he was nettled, I dropped my bantering vein.I asked; \"are you so well acquainted with all who visit\nthat house as to be able to say who are and who are not strangers to the\nfamily?\"I am well acquainted with the faces of their friends, and Henry\nClavering is not amongst the number; but----\"\n\n\"Were you ever with Mr.Leavenworth,\" I interrupted, \"when he has been\naway from home; in the country, for instance, or upon his travels?\"\"Yet I suppose he was in the habit of absenting himself from home?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.\"Can you tell me where he was last July, he and the ladies?\"\"Yes, sir; they went to R----.Ah,\"\nhe cried, seeing a change in my face, \"do you think he could have met\nthem there?\"I looked at him for a moment, then, rising in my turn, stood level with\nhim, and exclaimed:\n\n\"You are keeping something back, Mr.Harwell; you have more knowledge of\nthis man than you have hitherto given me to understand.He seemed astonished at my penetration, but replied: \"I know no more\nof the man than I have already informed you; but\"--and a burning flush\ncrossed his face, \"if you are determined to pursue this matter--\" and he\npaused, with an inquiring look.\"I am resolved to find out all I can about Henry Clavering,\" was my\ndecided answer.\"Then,\" said he, \"I can tell you this much.Henry Clavering wrote a\nletter to Mr.Leavenworth a few days before the murder, which I have\nsome reason to believe produced a marked effect upon the household.\"And, folding his arms, the secretary stood quietly awaiting my next\nquestion.Leavenworth's\nbusiness letters, and this, being from one unaccustomed to write to him,\nlacked the mark which usually distinguished those of a private nature.\"\"And you saw the name of Clavering?\"\"I did; Henry Ritchie Clavering.\"Harwell,\" I reiterated, \"this is no time for false delicacy.\"I did; but hastily, and with an agitated conscience.\"\"You can, however, recall its general drift?\"\"It was some complaint in regard to the treatment received by him at the\nhand of one of Mr.\"But you inferred----\"\n\n\"No, sir; that is just what I did not do.I forced myself to forget the\nwhole thing.\"\"And yet you say it produced an effect upon the family?\"None of them have ever appeared quite the\nsame as before.\"Harwell,\" I gravely continued; \"when you were questioned as to the\nreceipt of any letter by Mr.Leavenworth, which might seem in any manner\nto be connected with this tragedy, you denied having seen any such; how\nwas that?\"Raymond, you are a gentleman; have a chivalrous regard for the\nladies; do you think you could have brought yourself (even if in your\nsecret heart you considered some such result possible, which I am not\nready to say I did) to mention, at such a time as that, the receipt of\na letter complaining of the treatment received from one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, as a suspicious circumstance worthy to be taken\ninto account by a coroner's jury?\"\"What reason had I for thinking that letter was one of importance?I\nknew of no Henry Ritchie Clavering.\"I remember you hesitated before\nreplying.\"\"It is true; but not as I should hesitate now, if the question were put\nto me again.\"Silence followed these words, during which I took two or three turns up\nand down the room.\"This is all very fanciful,\" I remarked, laughing in the vain endeavor\nto throw off the superstitious horror his words had awakened.\"I am practical myself\nin broad daylight, and recognize the flimsiness of an accusation based\nupon a poor, hardworking secretary's dream, as plainly as you do.This\nis the reason I desired to keep from speaking at all; but, Mr.Raymond,\"\nand his long, thin hand fell upon my arm with a nervous intensity which\ngave me almost the sensation of an electrical shock, \"if the murderer of\nMr.Leavenworth is ever brought to confess his deed, mark my words, he\nwill prove to be the man of my dream.\"For a moment his belief was mine; and a mingled\nsensation of relief and exquisite pain swept over me as I thought of the\npossibility of Eleanore being exonerated from crime only to be plunged\ninto fresh humiliation and deeper abysses of suffering.\"He stalks the streets in freedom now,\" the secretary went on, as if to\nhimself; \"even dares to enter the house he has so wofully desecrated;\nbut justice is justice and, sooner or later, something will transpire\nwhich will prove to you that a premonition so wonderful as that\nI received had its significance; that the voice calling 'Trueman,\nTrueman,' was something more than the empty utterances of an excited\nbrain; that it was Justice itself, calling attention to the guilty.\"Did he know that the officers of justice were\nalready upon the track of this same Clavering?I judged not from his\nlook, but felt an inclination to make an effort and see.\"You speak with strange conviction,\" I said; \"but in all probability\nyou are doomed to be disappointed.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.Clavering is a\nrespectable man.\"\"I do not propose to denounce him;\nI do not even propose to speak his name again.I have spoken thus plainly to you only in explanation of last\nnight's most unfortunate betrayal; and while I trust you will regard\nwhat I have told you as confidential, I also hope you will give me\ncredit for behaving, on the whole, as well as could be expected under\nthe circumstances.\"\"Certainly,\" I replied as I took it.Then, with a sudden impulse to\ntest the accuracy of this story of his, inquired if he had any means of\nverifying his statement of having had this dream at the time spoken of:\nthat is, before the murder and not afterwards.\"No, sir; I know myself that I had it the night previous to that of Mr.Leavenworth's death; but I cannot prove the fact.\"\"Did not speak of it next morning to any one?\"\"O no, sir; I was scarcely in a position to do so.\"\"Yet it must have had a great effect upon you, unfitting you for\nwork----\"\n\n\"Nothing unfits me for work,\" was his bitter reply.\"I believe you,\" I returned, remembering his diligence for the last few\ndays.\"But you must at least have shown some traces of having passed an\nuncomfortable night.Have you no recollection of any one speaking to you\nin regard to your appearance the next morning?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.Leavenworth may have done so; no one else would be likely to\nnotice.\"There was sadness in the tone, and my own voice softened as I\nsaid:\n\n\"I shall not be at the house to-night, Mr.Harwell; nor do I know when\nI shall return there.Personal considerations keep me from Miss\nLeavenworth's presence for a time, and I look to you to carry on the\nwork we have undertaken without my assistance, unless you can bring it\nhere----\"\n\n\"I can do that.\"\"I shall expect you, then, to-morrow evening.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.\"Very well, sir\"; and he was going, when a sudden thought seemed to\nstrike him.\"Sir,\" he said, \"as we do not wish to return to this subject\nagain, and as I have a natural curiosity in regard to this man, would\nyou object to telling me what you know of him?You believe him to be a\nrespectable man; are you acquainted with him, Mr.\"I know his name, and where he resides.\"he murmured, with a strange intonation.He bit his lip, looked down, then up, finally fixed his eyes on mine,\nand returned, with marked emphasis: \"I used an exclamation, sir, because\nI was startled.\"\"Yes; you say he is an Englishman.Leavenworth had the most bitter\nantagonism to the English.He\nwould never be introduced to one if he could help it.\"\"You know,\" continued the secretary, \"that Mr.Leavenworth was a man who\ncarried his prejudices to the extreme.He had a hatred for the English\nrace amounting to mania.If he had known the letter I have mentioned was\nfrom an Englishman, I doubt if he would have read it.He used to say he\nwould sooner see a daughter of his dead before him than married to an\nEnglishman.\"I turned hastily aside to hide the effect which this announcement made\nupon me.\"You think I am exaggerating,\" he said.\"He had doubtless some cause for hating the English with which we are\nunacquainted,\" pursued the secretary.\"He spent some time in Liverpool\nwhen young, and had, of course, many opportunities for studying their\nmanners and character.\"And the secretary made another movement, as if\nto leave.But it was my turn to detain him now.Do you\nthink that, in the case of one of his nieces, say, desiring to marry a\ngentleman of that nationality, his prejudice was sufficient to cause him\nto absolutely forbid the match?\"I had learned what I wished, and saw no further reason for\nprolonging the interview.PATCH-WORK\n\n\n    \"Come, give us a taste of your quality.\"Clavering in his conversation of\nthe morning had been giving me, with more or less accuracy, a\ndetailed account of his own experience and position regarding Eleanore\nLeavenworth, I asked myself what particular facts it would be necessary\nfor me to establish in order to prove the truth of this assumption, and\nfound them to be:\n\nI. That Mr.Clavering had not only been in this country at the time\ndesignated, but that he had been located for some little time at a\nwatering-place in New York State.That this watering-place should correspond to the one in which Miss\nEleanore Leavenworth was staying at the same time.That they had been seen while there to hold more or less\ncommunication.That they had both been absent from town, at Lorne one time, long\nenough to have gone through the ceremony of marriage at a point twenty\nmiles or so away.V. That a Methodist clergyman, who has since died, lived at that time\nwithin a radius of twenty miles of said watering-place.I next asked myself how I was to establish these acts.Clavering's\nlife was as yet too little known to me to offer me any assistance; so,\nleaving it for the present, I took up the thread of Eleanore's history,\nand found that at the time given me she had been in R----, a fashionable\nwatering-place in this State.Now, if his was true, and my theory\ncorrect, he must have been there also.To prove this fact, became,\nconsequently, my first business.I resolved to go to R---- on the\nmorrow.But before proceeding in an undertaking of such importance, I considered\nit expedient to make such inquiries and", "question": "Where is the milk?

and\nthen, without further preliminaries, rushed into the subject which was\nuppermost in both our minds by inquiring, in a slightly sarcastic way,\nif I was very much surprised to find my bird flown when I returned to\nthe Hoffman House that afternoon.\"I was astonished to find you allowed him to fly at this time,\"\nI replied.\"From the manner in which you requested me to make his\nacquaintance, I supposed you considered him an important character in\nthe tragedy which has just been enacted.\"Oh, the fact that I let him go off\nso easily?I never fiddle with the brakes till the\ncar starts down-hill.But let that pass for the present; Mr.Clavering,\nthen, did not explain himself before going?\"\"That is a question which I find it exceedingly difficult to answer.Hampered by circumstances, I cannot at present speak with the directness\nwhich is your due, but what I can say, I will.Know, then, that in my\nopinion Mr.Clavering did explain himself in an interview with me this\nmorning.But it was done in so blind a way, it will be necessary for me\nto make a few investigations before I shall feel sufficiently sure of\nmy ground to take you into my confidence.He has given me a possible\nclue----\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Mr.Gryce; \"does he know this?Was it done intentionally\nand with sinister motive, or unconsciously and in plain good faith?\"\"It is very unfortunate you\ncannot explain yourself a little more definitely,\" he said at last.\"I\nam almost afraid to trust you to make investigations, as you call them,\non your own hook.You are not used to the business, and will lose time,\nto say nothing of running upon false scents, and using up your strength\non unprofitable details.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.\"You should have thought of that when you admitted me into partnership.\"\"And you absolutely insist upon working this mine alone?\"Gryce, the matter stands just here.Clavering, for all I know,\nis a gentleman of untarnished reputation.I am not even aware for what\npurpose you set me upon his trail.I only know that in thus following\nit I have come upon certain facts that seem worthy of further\ninvestigation.\"\"I know it, and for that reason I have come to you for such assistance\nas you can give me at this stage of the proceedings.You are in\npossession of certain facts relating to this man which it concerns me\nto know, or your conduct in reference to him has been purposeless.Now,\nfrankly, will you make me master of those facts: in short, tell me all\nyou know of Mr.Clavering, without requiring an immediate return of\nconfidence on my part?\"\"That is asking a great deal of a professional detective.\"\"I know it, and under other circumstances I should hesitate long before\npreferring such a request; but as things are, I don't see how I am to\nproceed in the matter without some such concession on your part.At all\nevents----\"\n\n\"Wait a moment!Clavering the lover of one of the young\nladies?\"Anxious as I was to preserve the secret of my interest in that\ngentleman, I could not prevent the blush from rising to my face at the\nsuddenness of this question.\"Being neither a relative nor\nacknowledged friend, I took it for granted he must occupy some such\nposition as that in the family.\"\"I do not see why you should draw such an inference,\" said I, anxious\nto determine how much he knew about him.Clavering is a stranger in\ntown; has not even been in this country long; has indeed had no time to\nestablish himself upon any such footing as you suggest.\"He was\nhere a year ago to my certain knowledge.\"Can it be possible I am groping blindly\nabout for facts which are already in your possession?I pray you listen\nto my entreaties, Mr.Gryce, and acquaint me at once with what I want to\nknow.If I succeed, the glory shall be yours; it I fail, the shame of the\ndefeat shall be mine.\"\"My reward will be to free an innocent woman from the imputation of\ncrime which hangs over her.\"His voice and appearance changed;\nfor a moment he looked quite confidential.\"Well, well,\" said he; \"and\nwhat is it you want to know?\"\"I should first like to know how your suspicions came to light on him\nat all.What reason had you for thinking a gentleman of his bearing and\nposition was in any way connected with this affair?\"\"That is a question you ought not to be obliged to put,\" he returned.\"Simply because the opportunity of answering it was in your hands before\never it came into mine.\"\"Don't you remember the letter mailed in your presence by Miss Mary\nLeavenworth during your drive from her home to that of her friend in\nThirty-seventh Street?\"\"Certainly, but----\"\n\n\"You never thought to look at its superscription before it was dropped\ninto the box.\"\"I had neither opportunity nor right to do so.\"\"And you never regarded the affair as worth your attention?\"\"However I may have regarded it, I did not see how I could prevent Miss\nLeavenworth from dropping a letter into a box if she chose to do so.\"\"That is because you are a _gentleman._ Well, it has its disadvantages,\"\nhe muttered broodingly.\"But you,\" said I; \"how came you to know anything about this letter?Ah, I see,\" remembering that the carriage in which we were riding at the\ntime had been procured for us by him.\"The man on the box was in your\npay, and informed, as you call it.\"Gryce winked at his muffled toes mysteriously.\"That is not the\npoint,\" he said.\"Enough that I heard that a letter, which might\nreasonably prove to be of some interest to me, had been dropped at such\nan hour into the box on the corner of a certain street.That, coinciding\nin the opinion of my informant, I telegraphed to the station connected\nwith that box to take note of the address of a suspicious-looking letter\nabout to pass through their hands on the way to the General Post Office,\nand following up the telegram in person, found that a curious epistle\naddressed in lead pencil and sealed with a stamp, had just arrived, the\naddress of which I was allowed to see----\"\n\n\"And which was?\"\"Henry R. Clavering, Hoffman House, New York.\"\"And so that is how your attention first came to\nbe directed to this man?\"\"Why, next I followed up the clue by going to the Hoffman House and\ninstituting inquiries.Clavering was a regular guest\nof the hotel.That he had come there, direct from the Liverpool\nsteamer, about three months since, and, registering his name as Henry\nR. Clavering, Esq., London, had engaged a first-class room which he had\nkept ever since.That, although nothing definite was known concerning\nhim, he had been seen with various highly respectable people, both of\nhis own nation and ours, by all of whom he was treated with respect.And\nlastly, that while not liberal, he had given many evidences of being a\nman of means.So much done, I entered the office, and waited for him to\ncome in, in the hope of having an opportunity to observe his manner when\nthe clerk handed him that strange-looking letter from Mary Leavenworth.\"\"No; an awkward gawk of a fellow stepped between us just at the critical\nmoment, and shut off my view.But I heard enough that evening from the\nclerk and servants, of the agitation he had shown on receiving it, to\nconvince me I was upon a trail worth following.I accordingly put on\nmy men, and for two days Mr.Clavering was subjected to the most\nrigid watch a man ever walked under.But nothing was gained by it; his\ninterest in the murder, if interest at all, was a secret one; and though\nhe walked the streets, studied the papers, and haunted the vicinity\nof the house in Fifth Avenue, he not only refrained from actually\napproaching it, but made no attempt to communicate with any of the\nfamily.Meanwhile, you crossed my path, and with your determination\nincited me to renewed effort.Clavering's bearing,\nand the gossip I had by this time gathered in regard to him, that no one\nshort of a gentleman and a friend could succeed in getting at the clue\nof his connection with this family, I handed him over to you, and----\"\n\n\"Found me rather an unmanageable colleague.\"Gryce smiled very much as if a sour plum had been put in his mouth,\nbut made no reply; and a momentary pause ensued.\"Did you think to inquire,\" I asked at last, \"if any one knew where Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the apple there.Clavering had spent the evening of the murder?\"It was agreed he went out during the\nevening; also that he was in his bed in the morning when the servant\ncame in to make his fire; but further than this no one seemed posted.\"\"So that, in fact, you gleaned nothing that would in any way connect\nthis man with the murder except his marked and agitated interest in it,\nand the fact that a niece of the murdered man had written a letter to\nhim?\"\"Another question; did you hear in what manner and at what time he\nprocured a newspaper that evening?\"\"No; I only learned that he was observed, by more than one, to hasten\nout of the dining-room with the _Post_ in his hand, and go immediately\nto his room without touching his dinner.\"Clavering had had a guilty knowledge of the crime, he would\neither have ordered dinner before opening the paper, or, having ordered\nit, he would have eaten it.\"\"Then you do not believe, from what you have learned, that Mr.Gryce shifted uneasily, glanced at the papers protruding from my\ncoat pocket and exclaimed: \"I am ready to be convinced by you that he\nis.\"That sentence recalled me to the business in hand.Without appearing to\nnotice his look, I recurred to my questions.Clavering was in this city last summer?Did you learn that, too, at the Hoffman House?\"\"No; I ascertained that in quite another way.In short, I have had a\ncommunication from London in regard to the matter.\"Yes; I've a friend there in my own line of business, who sometimes\nassists me with a bit of information, when requested.\"You have not had time to write to London, and receive an\nanswer since the murder.\"It is enough for me to telegraph him the\nname of a person, for him to understand that I want to know everything\nhe can gather in a reasonable length of time about that person.\"\"It is not there,\" he said; \"if you will be kind enough to feel in my\nbreast pocket you will find a letter----\"\n\nIt was in my hand before he finished his sentence.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.\"Excuse my\neagerness,\" I said.\"This kind of business is new to me, you know.\"He smiled indulgently at a very old and faded picture hanging on the\nwall before him.\"Eagerness is not a fault; only the betrayal of it.Let us hear what my friend Brown has to\ntell us of Mr.Henry Ritchie Clavering, of Portland Place, London.\"I took the paper to the light and read as follows:\n\n\n    \"Henry Ritchie Clavering, Gentleman, aged 43.Born in\n\n    ----, Hertfordshire, England.Clavering, for\n    short time in the army.Mother was Helen Ritchie, of Dumfriesshire,\n    Scotland; she is still living.Home with H.

for I have studied his chirography\ntoo much lately not to know it at a glance; but it may be--Hold!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.I\nsuddenly exclaimed, \"have you any mucilage handy?I think, if I could\npaste these strips down upon a piece of paper, so that they would\nremain flat, I should be able to tell you what I think of them much more\neasily.\"\"There is mucilage on the desk,\" signified Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.Procuring it, I proceeded to consult the scraps once more for evidence\nto guide me in their arrangement.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.These were more marked than I\nexpected; the longer and best preserved strip, with its \"Mr.Hor\" at\nthe top, showing itself at first blush to be the left-hand margin of\nthe letter, while the machine-cut edge of the next in length presented\ntokens fully as conclusive of its being the right-hand margin of the\nsame.Selecting these, then, I pasted them down on a piece of paper at\njust the distance they would occupy if the sheet from which they were\ntorn was of the ordinary commercial note size.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.Immediately it became\napparent: first, that it would take two other strips of the same width\nto fill up the space left between them; and secondly, that the writing\ndid not terminate at the foot of the sheet, but was carried on to\nanother page.Taking up the third strip, I looked at its edge; it was machine-cut\nat the top, and showed by the arrangement of its words that it was\nthe margin strip of a second leaf.Pasting that down by itself, I\nscrutinized the fourth, and finding it also machine-cut at the top but\nnot on the side, endeavored to fit it to the piece already pasted down,\nbut the words would not match.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple.Moving it along to the position it\nwould hold if it were the third strip, I fastened it down; the whole\npresenting, when completed, the appearance seen on the opposite page.Then, as I held it up\nbefore his eyes: \"But don't show it to me.Study it yourself, and tell\nme what you think of it.\"\"Well,\" said I, \"this much is certain: that it is a letter directed to\nMr.Leavenworth from some House, and dated--let's see; that is an _h,_\nisn't it?\"And I pointed to the one letter just discernible on the line\nunder the word House.\"I should think so; but don't ask me.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.\"It must be an _h._ The year is 1875, and this is not the termination\nof either January or February.Dated, then, March 1st, 1876, and\nsigned----\"\n\nMr.Gryce rolled his eyes in anticipatory ecstasy towards the ceiling.To this work the inquirer may turn, if he\nis anxious to see whether Scott's colouring is correct.The true blue of\nthe Covenant is not dulled in the \"Biographia Presbyteriana.\"With all these materials at his command, Scott was able almost to dwell\nin the age of the Covenant hence the extraordinary life and brilliance of\nthis, his first essay in fiction dealing with a remote time and obsolete\nmanners.His opening, though it may seem long and uninviting to modern\nreaders, is interesting for the sympathetic sketch of the gentle\nconsumptive dominie.If there was any class of men whom Sir Walter could\nnot away with, it was the race of schoolmasters, \"black cattle\" whom he\nneither trusted nor respected.But he could make or invent exceptions, as\nin the uncomplaining and kindly usher of the verbose Cleishbotham.Once\nlaunched in his legend, with the shooting of the Popinjay, he never\nfalters.The gallant, dauntless, overbearing Bothwell, the dour Burley,\nthe handful of Preachers, representing every current of opinion in the\nCovenant, the awful figure of Habakkuk Mucklewrath, the charm of goodness\nin Bessie McLure, are all immortal, deathless as Shakspeare's men and\nwomen.Indeed here, even more than elsewhere, we admire the life which\nScott breathes into his minor characters, Halliday and Inglis, the\ntroopers, the child who leads Morton to Burley's retreat in the cave,\nthat auld Laird Nippy, old Milnwood (a real \"Laird Nippy\" was a neighbour\nof Scott's at Ashiestiel), Ailie Wilson, the kind, crabbed old\nhousekeeper, generous in great things, though habitually niggardly in\nthings small.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Most of these are persons whom we might still meet in\nScotland, as we might meet Cuddie Headrigg--the shrewd, the blithe, the\nfaithful and humorous Cuddie.As to Miss Jenny Dennison, we can hardly\nforgive Scott for making that gayest of soubrettes hard and selfish in\nmarried life.He is too severe on the harmless and even beneficent race\nof coquettes, who brighten life so much, who so rapidly \"draw up with the\nnew pleugh lad,\" and who do so very little harm when all is said.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Jenny\nplays the part of a leal and brave lass in the siege of Tillietudlem,\nhunger and terror do not subdue her spirit; she is true, in spite of many\ntemptations, to her Cuddie, and we decline to believe that she was untrue\nto his master and friend.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Ikuse, no doubt, is a caricature, though Wodrow\nmakes us acquainted with at least one Mause, Jean Biggart, who \"all the\nwinter over was exceedingly straitened in wrestling and prayer as to the\nParliament, and said that still that place was brought before her, Our\nhedges are broken down!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.McCrie\nmust have laughed out loud, like Lady Louisa Stuart, when Mause exclaims:\n\"Neither will I peace for the bidding of no earthly potsherd, though it\nbe painted as red as a brick from the tower o' Babel, and ca' itsel' a\ncorporal.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.Manse, as we have said, is not more comic than heroic, a\nmother in that Sparta of the Covenant.The figure of Morton, as usual, is\nnot very attractive.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.In his review, Scott explains the weakness of his\nheroes as usually strangers in the land (Waverley, Lovel, Mannering,\nOsbaldistone), who need to have everything explained to them, and who are\nless required to move than to be the pivots of the general movement.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.But\nMorton is no stranger in the land.His political position in the juste\nmilieu is unexciting.A schoolboy wrote to Scott at this time, \"Oh, Sir\nWalter, how could you take the lady from the gallant Cavalier, and give\nher to the crop-eared Covenanter?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the kitchen.Probably Scott sympathised with his\nyoung critic, who longed \"to be a feudal chief, and to see his retainers\nhappy around him.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.But Edith Bellenden loved Morton, with that love\nwhich, as she said, and thought, \"disturbs the repose of the dead.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.McCrie might have disapproved of so fortunate\nan arrangement.The heroine herself does not live in the memory like Di\nVernon; she does not even live like Jenny Dennison.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.We remember Corporal\nRaddlebanes better, the stoutest fighting man of Major Bellenden's\nacquaintance; and the lady of Tillietudlem has admirers more numerous and\nmore constant.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.The lovers of the tale chiefly engage our interest by the\nrare constancy of their affections.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.The most disputed character is, of course, that of Claverhouse.There is\nno doubt that, if Claverhouse had been a man of the ordinary mould, he\nwould never have reckoned so many enthusiastic friends in future ages.But Beauty, which makes Helen immortal, had put its seal on Bonny Dundee.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.With that face \"which limners might have loved to paint, and ladies to\nlook upon,\" he still conquers hearts from his dark corner above the\nprivate staircase in Sir Walter's deserted study.He was brave, he was\nloyal when all the world forsook his master; in that reckless age of\nrevelry he looks on with the austere and noble contempt which he wears in\nHell among the tippling shades of Cavaliers.He died in the arms of\nvictory, but he lives among\n\n                         The chiefs of ancient names\n     Who swore to fight and die beneath the banner of King James,\n     And he fell in Killiecrankie Pass, the glory of the Grahames.Sentiment in romance, not in history, may be excused for pardoning the\nrest.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.Critics of the time, as Lady Louisa Stuart reminds Sir Walter, did not\nbelieve the book was his, because it lacked his \"tedious descriptions.\"The descriptions, as of the waterfall where Burley had his den, are\nindeed far from \"tedious.\"There is a tendency in Scott to exalt into\nmountains \"his own grey hills,\" the _bosses verdatres_ as Prosper Merimee\ncalled them, of the Border.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.But the horrors of such linns as that down\nwhich Hab Dab and Davie Dinn \"dang the deil\" are not exaggerated.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.\"Old Mortality\" was the last novel written by Scott before the malady\nwhich tormented his stoicism in 1817-1820.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.Every reader has his own\nfavourite, but few will place this glorious tale lower than second in the\nlist of his incomparable romances.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.INTRODUCTION TO THE TALES OF MY LANDLORD.As I may, without vanity, presume that the name and official description\nprefixed to this Proem will secure it, from the sedate and reflecting\npart of mankind, to whom only I would be understood to address myself,\nsuch attention as is due to the sedulous instructor of youth, and the\ncareful performer of my Sabbath duties, I will forbear to hold up a\ncandle to the daylight, or to point out to the judicious those\nrecommendations of my labours which they must necessarily anticipate from\nthe perusal of the title-page.Nevertheless, I am not unaware, that, as\nEnvy always dogs Merit at the heels, there may be those who will whisper,\nthat albeit my learning and good principles cannot (lauded be the\nheavens) be denied by any one, yet that my situation at Gandercleugh hath\nbeen more favourable to my acquisitions in learning than to the\nenlargement of my views of the ways and works of the present generation.To the which objection, if, peradventure, any such shall be started, my\nanswer shall be threefold:\n\nFirst, Gandercleugh is, as it were, the central part--the navel (_si fas\nsit dicere_) of this our native realm of Scotland; so that men, from\nevery corner thereof, when travelling on their concernments of business,\neither towards our metropolis of law, by which I mean Edinburgh, or\ntowards our metropolis and mart of gain, whereby I insinuate Glasgow, are\nfrequently led to make Gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of rest\nfor the night.And it must be acknowledged by the most sceptical, that I,\nwho have sat in the leathern armchair, on the left-hand side of the fire,\nin the common room of the Wallace Inn, winter and summer, for every\nevening in my life, during forty years bypast, (the Christian Sabbaths\nonly excepted,) must have seen more of the manners and customs of various\ntribes and people, than if I had sought them out by my own painful travel\nand bodily labour.Even so doth the tollman at the well-frequented\nturnpike on the Wellbrae-head, sitting at his ease in his own dwelling,\ngather more receipt of custom, than if, moving forth upon the road, he\nwere to require a contribution from each person whom he chanced to meet\nin his journey, when, according to the vulgar adage, he might possibly be\ngreeted with more kicks than halfpence.But, secondly, supposing it again urged, that Ithacus, the most wise of\nthe Greeks, acquired his renown, as the Roman poet hath assured us, by\nvisiting states and men, I reply to the Zoilus who shall adhere to this\nobjection,  that, _de facto_, I have seen states and men also; for I have\nvisited the famous cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the former twice, and\nthe latter three times, in the course of my earthly pilgrimage.And,\nmoreover, I had the honour to sit in the General Assembly (meaning, as an\nauditor, in the galleries thereof,) and have heard as much goodly\nspeaking on the law of patronage, as, with the fructification thereof in\nmine own understanding, hath made me be considered as an oracle upon that\ndoctrine ever since my safe and happy return to Gandercleugh.Again,--and thirdly, If it be nevertheless pretended that my information\nand knowledge of mankind, however extensive, and however painfully\nacquired, by constant domestic enquiry, and by foreign travel, is,\nnatheless, incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives\nof my Landlord, I will let these critics know, to their own eternal shame\nand confusion, as well as to the abashment and discomfiture of all who\nshall rashly take up a song against me, that I am NOT the writer,\nredacter, or compiler, of the \"Tales of my Landlord;\" nor am I, in one\nsingle iota, answerable for their contents, more or less.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the office.And now, ye\ngeneration of critics, who raise yourselves up as if it were brazen\nserpents, to hiss with your tongues, and to smite with your stings, bow\nyourselves down to your native dust, and acknowledge that yours have been\nthe thoughts of ignorance, and the words of vain foolishness.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.ye are\ncaught in your own snare, and your own pit hath yawned for you.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.Turn,\nthen, aside from the task that is too heavy for you; destroy not your\nteeth by gnawing a file; waste not your strength by spurning against a\ncastle wall; nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness with a\nfleet steed; and let those weigh the \"Tales of my Landlord,\" who shall\nbring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust of prejudice\nby the hands of intelligent modesty.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the milk there.For these alone they were compiled,\nas will appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth compelled\nme to make supplementary to the present Proem.It is well known that my Landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man,\nacceptable unto all the parish of Gandercleugh, excepting only the Laird,\nthe Exciseman, and those for whom he refused to draw liquor upon trust.Their causes of dislike I will touch separately, adding<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "His honour, the Laird, accused our Landlord, deceased, of having\nencouraged, in various times and places, the destruction of hares,\nrabbits, fowls black and grey, partridges, moor-pouts, roe-deer, and\nother birds and quadrupeds, at unlawful seasons, and contrary to the laws\nof this realm, which have secured, in their wisdom, the slaughter of such\nanimals for the great of the earth, whom I have remarked to take an\nuncommon (though to me, an unintelligible) pleasure therein.Now, in\nhumble deference to his honour, and in justifiable defence of my friend\ndeceased, I reply to this charge, that howsoever the form of such animals\nmight appear to be similar to those so protected by the law, yet it was a\nmere _deceptio visus_;

and in defiance of\nhim, his gauging-stick, and pen and inkhorn, I tell him, that I never\nsaw, or tasted, a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of my\nLandlord; nay, that, on the contrary, we needed not such devices, in\nrespect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor, which was vended and\nconsumed at the Wallace Inn, under the name of mountain dew.If there is\na penalty against manufacturing such a liquor, let him show me the\nstatute; and when he does, I'll tell him if I will obey it or no.Concerning those who came to my Landlord for liquor, and went thirsty\naway, for lack of present coin, or future credit, I cannot but say it has\ngrieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.Nevertheless, my\nLandlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul, and would permit\nthem, in extreme need, and when their soul was impoverished for lack of\nmoisture, to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing\napparel, exclusively of their inferior habiliments, which he was\nuniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain, for the credit of the\nhouse.As to mine own part, I may well say, that he never refused me that\nmodicum of refreshment with which I am wont to recruit nature after the\nfatigues of my school.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the milk there.It is true, I taught his five sons English and\nLatin, writing, book-keeping, with a tincture of mathematics, and that I\ninstructed his daughter in psalmody.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.Nor do I remember me of any fee or\nhonorarium received from him on account of these my labours, except the\ncompotations aforesaid.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.Nevertheless this compensation suited my humour\nwell, since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait till\nquarter-day.But, truly, were I to speak my simple conceit and belief, I think my\nLandlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition of\na symbol, or reckoning, from the pleasure he was wont to take in my\nconversation, which, though solid and edifying in the main, was, like a\nwell-built palace, decorated with facetious narratives and devices,\ntending much to the enhancement and ornament thereof.And so pleased was\nmy Landlord of the Wallace in his replies during such colloquies, that\nthere was no district in Scotland, yea, and no peculiar, and, as it were,\ndistinctive custom therein practised, but was discussed betwixt us;\ninsomuch, that those who stood by were wont to say, it was worth a bottle\nof ale to hear us communicate with each other.And not a few travellers,\nfrom distant parts, as well as from the remote districts of our kingdom,\nwere wont to mingle in the conversation, and to tell news that had been\ngathered in foreign lands, or preserved from oblivion in this our own.Now I chanced to have contracted for teaching the lower classes with a\nyoung person called Peter, or Patrick, Pattieson, who had been educated\nfor our Holy Kirk, yea, had, by the license of presbytery, his voice\nopened therein as a preacher, who delighted in the collection of olden\ntales and legends, and in garnishing them with the flowers of poesy,\nwhereof he was a vain and frivolous professor.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.For he followed not the\nexample of those strong poets whom I proposed to him as a pattern, but\nformed versification of a flimsy and modern texture, to the compounding\nwhereof was necessary small pains and less thought.And hence I have chid\nhim as being one of those who bring forward the fatal revolution\nprophesied by Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.Robert Carey, in his Vaticination on the Death of the\ncelebrated Dr.John Donne:\n\n          Now thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be\n          Too hard for libertines in poetry;\n          Till verse (by thee refined) in this last age\n          Turn ballad rhyme.I had also disputations with him touching his indulging rather a flowing\nand redundant than a concise and stately diction in his prose\nexercitations.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.But notwithstanding these symptoms of inferior taste, and\na humour of contradicting his betters upon passages of dubious\nconstruction in Latin authors, I did grievously lament when Peter\nPattieson was removed from me by death, even as if he had been the\noffspring of my own loins.And in respect his papers had been left in my\ncare, (to answer funeral and death-bed expenses,) I conceived myself\nentitled to dispose of one parcel thereof, entitled, \"Tales of my\nLandlord,\" to one cunning in the trade (as it is called) of book\nselling.He was a mirthful man, of small stature, cunning in\ncounterfeiting of voices, and in making facetious tales and responses,\nand whom I have to laud for the truth of his dealings towards me.Now, therefore, the world may see the injustice that charges me with\nincapacity to write these narratives, seeing, that though I have proved\nthat I could have written them if I would, yet, not having done so, the\ncensure will deservedly fall, if at all due, upon the memory of Mr.Peter\nPattieson;

for the Castle of\nDunnottar, though lying in the anti-covenanting district of the Mearns,\nwas, with the parish churchyard, celebrated for the oppressions sustained\nthere by the Cameronians in the time of James II.It was in 1685, when Argyle was threatening a descent upon Scotland, and\nMonmouth was preparing to invade the west of England, that the Privy\nCouncil of Scotland, with cruel precaution, made a general arrest of more\nthan a hundred persons in the southern and western provinces, supposed,\nfrom their religious principles, to be inimical to Government, together\nwith many women and children.These captives were driven northward like a\nflock of bullocks, but with less precaution to provide for their wants,\nand finally penned up in a subterranean dungeon in the Castle of\nDunnottar, having a window opening to the front of a precipice which\noverhangs the German Ocean.They had suffered not a little on the\njourney, and were much hurt both at the scoffs of the northern\nprelatists, and the mocks, gibes, and contemptuous tunes played by the\nfiddlers and pipers who had come from every quarter as they passed, to\ntriumph over the revilers of their calling.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football.The repose which the\nmelancholy dungeon afforded them, was anything but undisturbed.The\nguards made them pay for every indulgence, even that of water; and when\nsome of the prisoners resisted a demand so unreasonable, and insisted on\ntheir right to have this necessary of life untaxed, their keepers emptied\nthe water on the prison floor, saying, \"If they were obliged to bring\nwater for the canting whigs, they were not bound to afford them the use\nof bowls or pitchers gratis.\"In this prison, which is still termed the Whig's Vault, several died of\nthe diseases incidental to such a situation; and others broke their\nlimbs, and incurred fatal injury, in desperate attempts to escape from\ntheir stern prison-house.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Over the graves of these unhappy persons, their\nfriends, after the Revolution, erected a monument with a suitable\ninscription.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.This peculiar shrine of the Whig martyrs is very much honoured by their\ndescendants, though residing at a great distance from the land of their\ncaptivity and death.Walker, told me, that being\nonce upon a tour in the south of Scotland, probably about forty years\nsince, he had the bad luck to involve himself in the labyrinth of\npassages and tracks which cross, in every direction, the extensive waste\ncalled Lochar Moss, near Dumfries, out of which it is scarcely possible\nfor a stranger to extricate himself; and there was no small difficulty in\nprocuring a guide, since such people as he saw were engaged in digging\ntheir peats--a work of paramount necessity, which will hardly brook\ninterruption.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk.Walker could, therefore, only procure unintelligible\ndirections in the southern brogue, which differs widely from that of the\nMearns.He was beginning to think himself in a serious dilemma, when he\nstated his case to a farmer of rather the better class, who was employed,\nas the others, in digging his winter fuel.The old man at first made the\nsame excuse with those who had already declined acting as the traveller's\nguide; but perceiving him in great perplexity, and paying the respect due\nto his profession, \"You are a clergyman, sir?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.\"And I observe from your speech, that you are from the\nnorth?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.--\"You are right, my good friend,\" was the reply.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.\"And may I ask\nif you have ever heard of a place called Dunnottar?\"<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.--\"I ought to know\nsomething about it, my friend,\" said Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.Walker, \"since I have been\nseveral years the minister of the parish.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.--\"I am glad to hear it,\" said\nthe Dumfriesian, \"for one of my near relations lies buried there, and\nthere is, I believe, a monument over his grave.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.I would give half of what\nI am aught, to know if it is still in existence.\"--\"He was one of those\nwho perished in the Whig's Vault at the castle?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.said the minister;

and rejecting all other offers of recompense, only\nrequested, after he had guided Mr.Walker to a safe and dry road, that he\nwould let him have a written copy of the inscription.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the apple.It was whilst I was listening to this story, and looking at the monument\nreferred to, that I saw Old Mortality engaged in his daily task of\ncleaning and repairing the ornaments and epitaphs upon the tomb.His\nappearance and equipment were exactly as described in the Novel.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.I was\nvery desirous to see something of a person so singular, and expected to\nhave done so, as he took up his quarters with the hospitable and\nliberal-spirited minister.Walker invited him up after\ndinner to partake of a glass of spirits and water, to which he was\nsupposed not to be very averse, yet he would not speak frankly upon the\nsubject of his occupation.He was in bad humour, and had, according to\nhis phrase, no freedom for conversation with us.His spirit had been sorely vexed by hearing, in a certain Aberdonian\nkirk, the psalmody directed by a pitch-pipe, or some similar instrument,\nwhich was to Old Mortality the abomination of abominations.Perhaps,\nafter all, he did not feel himself at ease with his company;

and he gradually neglected even the\n     common prudential duty of providing for his offspring.From about\n     the year 1758, he neglected wholly to return from Galloway to his\n     wife and five children at Gatelowbrigg, which induced her to send\n     her eldest son Walter, then only twelve years of age, to Galloway,\n     in search of his father.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.After traversing nearly the whole of that\n     extensive district, from the Nick of Benncorie to the Fell of\n     Barullion, he found him at last working on the Cameronian monuments,\n     in the old kirkyard of Kirkchrist, on the west side of the Dee,\n     opposite the town of Kirkcudbright.The little wanderer used all the\n     influence in his power to induce his father to return to his family;\n     but in vain.Paterson sent even some of her female children\n     into Galloway in search of their father, for the same purpose of\n     persuading him to return home; but without any success.At last, in\n     the summer of 1768, she removed to the little upland village of\n     Balmaclellan, in the Glenkens of Galloway, where, upon the small\n     pittance derived from keeping a little school, she supported her\n     numerous family in a respectable manner.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple there.\"There is a small monumental stone in the farm of the Caldon, near\n     the House of the Hill, in Wigtonshire, which is highly venerated as\n     being the first erected, by Old Mortality, to the memory of several\n     persons who fell at that place in defence of their religious tenets\n     in the civil war, in the reign of Charles Second.\"From the Caldon, the labours of Old Mortality, in the course of\n     time, spread over nearly all the Lowlands of Scotland.There are few\n     churchyards in Ayrshire, Galloway, or Dumfries-shire, where the work\n     of his chisel is not yet to be seen.It is easily distinguished from\n     the work of any other artist by the primitive rudeness of the\n     emblems of death, and of the inscriptions which adorn the ill-formed\n     blocks of his erection.This task of repairing and erecting\n     gravestones, practised without fee or reward, was the only\n     ostensible employment of this singular person for upwards of forty\n     years.The door of every Cameronian's house was indeed open to him\n     at all times when he chose to enter, and he was gladly received as\n     an inmate of the family; but he did not invariably accept of these\n     civilities, as may be seen by the following account of his frugal\n     expenses, found, amongst other little papers, (some of which I have\n     likewise in my possession,) in his pocket-book after his death.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.Gatehouse of Fleet, 4th February, 1796.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.ROBERT PATERBON debtor to MARGARET CHRYSTALE.To drye Lodginge for seven weeks,....... 0  4  1\n          To Four Auchlet of Ait Meal,............ 0  3  4\n          To 6 Lippies of Potatoes................ 0  1  3\n          To Lent Money at the time of Mr.Men engaged in the practice of these are called artizans, as opposed to\nartists, who are concerned with the fine arts.The next step in elevation of art is the addition of the intelligences\nwhich have no connection with bodily dexterity; as, for instance, in\nhunting, the knowledge of the habits of animals and their places of\nabode; in architecture, of mathematics; in painting, of harmonies of\ncolor; in music, of those of sound; all this pure science being joined\nwith readiness of expedient in applying it, and with shrewdness in\napprehension of difficulties, either present or probable.It will often happen that intelligence of this kind is possessed without\nbodily dexterity, or the need of it; one man directing and another\nexecuting, as for the most part in architecture, war, and seamanship.And it is to be observed, also, that in proportion to the dignity of the\nart, the bodily dexterities needed even in its subordinate agents become\nless important, and are more and more replaced by intelligence; as in\nthe steering of a ship, the bodily dexterity required is less than in\nshooting or fencing, but the intelligence far greater: and so in war,\nthe mere swordsmanship and marksmanship of the troops are of small\nimportance in comparison with their disposition, and right choice of the\nmoment of action.So that arts of this second order must be estimated,\nnot by the quantity of bodily dexterity they require, but by the\nquantity and dignity of the knowledge needed in their practice, and by\nthe degree of subtlety needed in bringing such knowledge into play.War\ncertainly stands first in the general mind, not only as the greatest of\nthe arts which I have called of the second order, but as the greatest of\nall arts.It is not, however, easy to distinguish the respect paid to\nthe Power, from that rendered to the Art of the soldier; the honor of\nvictory being more dependent, in the vulgar mind, on its results, than\nits difficulties.I believe, however, that taking into consideration the\ngreatness of the anxieties under which this art must be practised, the\nmultitude of circumstances to be known and regarded in it, and the\nsubtleties both of apprehension and stratagem constantly demanded by it,\nas well as the multiplicity of disturbing accidents and doubtful\ncontingencies against which it must make provision on the instant, it\nmust indeed rank as far the first of the arts of the second order; and\nnext to this great art of killing, medicine being much like war in its\nstratagems and watchings against its dark and subtle death-enemy.Then the arts of the first order will be those in which the Imaginative\npart of the intellect and the Sensitive part of the soul are joined: as\npoetry, architecture, and painting; these forming a kind of cross, in\ntheir part of the scheme of the human being, with those of the second\norder, which wed the Intelligent part of the intellect and Resolute part\nof the soul.But the reader must feel more and more, at every step, the\nimpossibility of classing the arts themselves, independently of the men\nby whom they are practised; and how an art, low in itself, may be made\nnoble by the quantity of human strength and being which a great man will\npour into it; and an art, great in itself, be made mean by the meanness\nof the mind occupied in it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.I do not intend, when I call painting an art\nof the first, and war an art of the second, order, to class Dutch\nlandscape painters with good soldiers; but I mean, that if from such a\nman as Napoleon we were to take away the honor of all that he had done\nin law and civil government, and to give him the reputation of his\nsoldiership only, his name would be less, if justly weighed, than that\nof Buonarroti, himself a good soldier also, when need was.But I will\nnot endeavor to pursue the inquiry, for I believe that of all the arts\nof the first order it would be found that all that a man has, or is, or\ncan be, he can fully express in them, and give to any of them, and find\nit not enough.The same rapid judgment which I wish to enable the reader to form of\narchitecture, may in some sort also be formed of painting, owing to the\nclose connection between execution and expression in the latter; as\nbetween structure and expression in the former.We ought to be able to\ntell good painting by a side glance as we pass along a gallery; and,\nuntil we can do so, we are not fit to pronounce judgment at all: not\nthat I class this easily visible excellence of painting with the great\nexpressional qualities which time and watchfulness only unfold.I have\nagain and again insisted on the supremacy of these last and shall\nalways continue to do so.But I perceive a tendency among some of the\nmore thoughtful critics of the day to forget that the business of a\npainter is to _paint_, and so altogether to despise those men, Veronese\nand Rubens for instance, who were painters, par excellence, and in whom\nthe expressional qualities are subordinate.Now it is well, when we have\nstrong moral or poetical feeling manifested in painting, to mark this as\nthe best part of the work; but it is not well to consider as a thing of\nsmall account, the painter's language in which that feeling is conveyed,\nfor if that language be not good and lovely, the man may indeed be a\njust moralist or a great poet, but he is not a _painter_, and it was\nwrong of him to paint.He had much better put his morality into sermons,\nand his poetry into verse, than into a language of which he was not\nmaster.And this mastery of the language is that of which we should be\ncognizant by a glance of the eye; and if that be not found, it is wasted\ntime to look farther: the man has mistaken his vocation, and his\nexpression of himself will be cramped by his awkward efforts to do what\nhe was not fit to do.On the other hand, if the man be a painter indeed,\nand have the gift of colors and lines, what is in him will come from his\nhand freely and faithfully; and the language itself is so difficult and\nso vast, that the mere possession of it argues the man is great, and\nthat his works are worth reading.So that I have never yet seen the case\nin which this true artistical excellence, visible by the eye-glance, was\nnot the index of some true expressional worth in the work.Neither have\nI ever seen a good expressional work without high artistical merit: and\nthat this is ever denied is only owing to the narrow view which men are\napt to take both of expression and of art; a narrowness consequent on\ntheir own especial practice and habits of thought.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bathroom.A man long trained to\nlove the monk's visions of Fra Angelico, turns in proud and ineffable\ndisgust from the first work of Rubens which he encounters on his return\nacross the Alps.He has forgotten,\nthat while Angelico prayed and wept in his _olive shade_, there was\ndifferent work doing in the dank fields of Flanders;--wild seas to be\nbanked out; endless canals to be dug, and boundless marshes to be\ndrained; hard ploughing and harrowing of the frosty clay; careful\nbreeding of stout horses and fat cattle; close setting of brick walls\nagainst cold winds and snow; much hardening of hands and gross\nstoutening of bodies in all this; gross jovialities of harvest homes and\nChristmas feasts, which were to be the reward of it; rough affections,\nand sluggish imagination;

so perfect and beautiful,\nthat his work may be recognised at any distance by the rainbow-play and\nbrilliancy of it: However closely it may be surrounded by other works of\nthe same school, glowing with enamel and gold, Angelico's may be told\nfrom them at a glance, like so many huge pieces of opal lying among\ncommon marbles.So again with Giotto; the Arena chapel is not only the\nmost perfect expressional work, it is the prettiest piece of wall\ndecoration and fair color, in North Italy.Now there is a correspondence of the same kind between the technical and\nexpressional parts of architecture;--not a true or entire\ncorrespondence, so that when the expression is best, the building must\nbe also best; but so much of correspondence as that good building is\nnecessary to good expression, comes before it, and is to be primarily\nlooked for: and the more, because the manner of building is capable of\nbeing determinately estimated and classed; but the expressional\ncharacter not so: we can at once determine the true value of technical\nqualities, we can only approximate to the value of expressional\nqualities: and besides this, the looking for the technical qualities\nfirst will enable us to cast a large quantity of rubbish aside at once,\nand so to narrow the difficult field of inquiry into expression: we\nshall get rid of Chinese pagodas and Indian temples, and Renaissance\nPalladianisms, and Alhambra stucco and filigree, in one great rubbish\nheap; and shall not need to trouble ourselves about their expression, or\nanything else concerning them.Then taking the buildings which have been\nrightly put together, and which show common sense in their structure, we\nmay look for their farther and higher excellences; but on those which\nare absurd in their first steps we need waste no time.I could have wished, before writing this chapter, to have given more\nstudy to the difficult subject of the strength of shafts of different\nmaterials and structure; but I cannot enter into every inquiry which\ngeneral criticism might suggest, and this I believe to be one which\nwould have occupied the reader with less profit than many others: all\nthat is necessary for him to note is, that the great increase of\nstrength gained by a tubular form in iron shafts, of given solid\ncontents, is no contradiction to the general principle stated in the\ntext, that the strength of materials is most available when they are\nmost concentrated.The strength of the tube is owing to certain\nproperties of the arch formed by its sides, not to the dispersion of its\nmaterials: and the principle is altogether inapplicable to stone shafts.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.No one would think of building a pillar of a succession of sandstone\nrings; however strong it might be, it would be still stronger filled up,\nand the substitution of such a pillar for a solid one of the same\ncontents would lose too much space; for a stone pillar, even when solid,\nmust be quite as thick as is either graceful or convenient, and in\nmodern churches is often too thick as it is, hindering sight of the\npreacher, and checking the sound of his voice.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.Some three months ago, and long after the writing of this passage, I met\naccidentally with Mr.If I had cared about the reputation of originality, I should have\nbeen annoyed--and was so, at first, on finding Mr.Garbett's\nillustrations of the subject exactly the same as mine, even to the\nchoice of the elephant's foot for the parallel of the Doric pillar: I\neven thought of omitting, or rewriting, great part of the chapter, but\ndetermined at last to let it stand.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.I am striving to speak plain truths\non many simple and trite subjects, and I hope, therefore, that much of\nwhat I say has been said before, and am quite willing to give up all\nclaim to originality in any reasoning or assertion whatsoever, if any\none cares to dispute it.I desire the reader to accept what I say, not\nas mine, but as the truth, which may be all the world's, if they look\nfor it.Frank Howard promised at some\ndiscussion respecting the \"Seven Lamps,\" reported in the \"Builder,\" to\npluck all my borrowed feathers off me; but I did not see the end of the\ndiscussion, and do not know to this day how many feathers I have left:\nat all events the elephant's foot must belong to Mr.Garbett, though,\nstrictly speaking, neither he nor I can be quite justified in using it,\nfor an elephant in reality stands on tiptoe; and this is by no means the\nexpression of a Doric shaft.As, however, I have been obliged to speak\nof this treatise of Mr.Garbett's, and desire also to recommend it as of\nmuch interest and utility in its statements of fact, it is impossible\nfor me to pass altogether without notice, as if unanswerable, several\npassages in which the writer has objected to views stated in the \"Seven\nLamps.\"I should at any rate have noticed the passage quoted above,\n(Chap.30th,) which runs counter to the spirit of all I have ever\nwritten, though without referring to me; but the references to the\n\"Seven Lamps\" I should not have answered, unless I had desired,\ngenerally, to recommend the book, and partly also, because they may\nserve as examples of the kind of animadversion which the \"Seven Lamps\"\nhad to sustain from architects, very generally; which examples being\nonce answered, there will be little occasion for my referring in future\nto other criticisms of the kind.The first reference to the \"Seven Lamps\" is in the second page, where\nMr.Garbett asks a question, \"Why are not convenience and stability\nenough to constitute a fine building?\"--which I should have answered\nshortly by asking another, \"Why we have been made men, and not bees nor\ntermites:\" but Mr.Garbett has given a very pretty, though partial,\nanswer to it himself, in his 4th to 9th pages,--an answer which I\nheartily beg the reader to consider.But, in page 12, it is made a grave\ncharge against me, that I use the words beauty and ornament\ninterchangeably.I do so, and ever shall; and so, I believe, one day,\nwill Mr.Garbett himself; but not while he continues to head his pages\nthus:--\"Beauty not dependent on ornament, _or superfluous_ features.\"What right has he to assume that ornament, rightly so called, ever was,\nor can be, superfluous?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.I have said before, and repeatedly in other\nplaces, that the most beautiful things are the most useless; I never\nsaid superfluous.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.I said useless in the well-understood and usual sense,\nas meaning, inapplicable to the service of the body.Thus I called\npeacocks and lilies useless; meaning, that roast peacock was unwholesome\n(taking Juvenal's word for it), and that dried lilies made bad hay: but\nI do not think peacocks superfluous birds, nor that the world could get\non well without its lilies.Or, to look closer, I suppose the peacock's\nblue eyes to be very useless to him; not dangerous indeed, as to their\nfirst master, but of small service, yet I do not think there is a\nsuperfluous eye in all his tail; and for lilies, though the great King\nof Israel was not \"arrayed\" like one of them, can Mr.Garbett tell us\nwhich are their superfluous leaves?Is there no Diogenes among lilies?none to be found content to drink dew, but out of silver?The fact is, I\nnever met with the architect yet who did not think ornament meant a\nthing to be bought in a shop and pinned on, or left off, at\narchitectural toilets, as the fancy seized them, thinking little more\nthan many women do of the other kind of ornament--the only true\nkind,--St.Peter's kind,--\"Not that outward adorning, but the inner--of\nthe heart.\"I do not mean that architects cannot conceive this better\nornament, but they do not understand that it is the _only_ ornament;\nthat _all_ architectural ornament is this, and nothing but this; that a\nnoble building never has any extraneous or superfluous ornament; that\nall its parts are necessary to its loveliness, and that no single atom\nof them could be removed without harm to its life.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.You do not build a\ntemple and then dress it.[101] You create it in its loveliness, and\nleave it, as her Maker left Eve.Not unadorned, I believe, but so well\nadorned as to need no feather crowns.And I use the words ornament and\nbeauty interchangeably, in order that architects may understand this: I\nassume that their building is to be a perfect creature capable of\nnothing less than it has, and needing nothing more.It may, indeed,\nreceive additional decoration afterwards, exactly as a woman may\ngracefully put a bracelet on her arm, or set a flower in her hair: but\nthat additional decoration is _not_ the _architecture_.It is of\ncurtains, pictures, statues, things that may be taken away from the\nbuilding, and not hurt it.He\nhas only to do with what is part of the building itself, that is to say,\nits own inherent beauty.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.Garbett does not understand or\nacknowledge this, he is led on from error to error; for we next find him\nendeavoring to define beauty as distinct from ornament, and saying that\n\"Positive beauty may be produced by a studious collation of whatever\nwill display design, order, and congruity.\"There\nis a highly studious collation of whatever will display design, order,\nand congruity, in a skull, is there not?--yet small beauty.The nose is\na decorative feature,--yet slightly necessary to beauty, it seems to me;\nnow, at least, for I once thought I must be wrong in considering a skull\ndisagreeable.I gave it fair trial: put one on my bed-room\nchimney-piece, and looked at it by sunrise every morning, and by\nmoonlight every night, and by all the best lights I could think of, for\na month, in vain.I found it as ugly at last as I did at first.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.So,\nalso, the hair is a decoration, and its natural curl is of little use;\nbut can Mr.Garbett conceive a bald beauty; or does he prefer a wig,\nbecause that is a \"_studious_ collation\" of whatever will produce\ndesign, order, and congruity?So the flush of the cheek is a\ndecoration,--God's painting of the temple of his spirit,--and the\nredness of the lip; and yet poor Viola thought it beauty truly blent;\nand I hold with her.The second point questioned is my assertion, \"Ornament cannot be\novercharged if it is good, and is always overcharged when it is bad.\"Garbett objects in these terms: \"I must contend, on the\ncontrary, that the very best ornament may be overcharged by being\nmisplaced.\"Garbett cannot get rid of his unfortunate notion that\nornament is a thing to be manufactured separately, and fastened on.He\nsupposes that an ornament may be called good in itself, in the\nstonemason's yard or in the ironmonger's shop: Once for all, let him put\nthis idea out of his head.We may say of a thing, considered separately,\nthat it is a pretty thing; but before we can say it is a good ornament,\nwe must know what it is to adorn, and how.As, for instance, a ring of\ngold is a pretty thing; it is a good ornament on a woman's finger; not a\ngood ornament hung through her under lip.A hollyhock, seven feet high,\nwould be a good ornament for a cottage-garden; not a good ornament for a\nlady's head-dress.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Garbett have seen this without my\nshowing?and that, therefore, when I said \"_good_\" ornament, I said\n\"well-placed\" ornament, in one word, and that, also, when Mr.Garbett\nsays \"it may be overcharged by being misplaced,\" he merely says it may\nbe overcharged by being _bad_.But, granted that ornament _were_ independent of its position,\nand might be pronounced good in a separate form, as books are good, or\nmen are good.--Suppose I had written to a student in Oxford, \"You cannot\nhave too many books, if they be good books;\" and he had answered me,\n\"Yes, for if I have many, I have no place to put them in but the\ncoal-cellar.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.Would that in anywise affect the general principle that\nhe could not have too many books?Or suppose he had written, \"I must not have too many, they confuse my\nhead.\"I should have written back to him: \"Don't buy books to put in the\ncoal-hole, nor read them if they confuse your head; you cannot have too\nmany, if they be good: but if you are too lazy to take care of them, or\ntoo dull to profit by them, you are better without them.\"Exactly in the same tone, I repeat to Mr.Garbett, \"You cannot have too\nmuch ornament, if it be good: but if you are too indolent to arrange it,\nor too dull to take advantage of it, assuredly you are better without\nit.\"The other points bearing on this question have already been stated in\nthe close of the 21st chapter.The third reference I have to answer, is to my repeated assertion, that\nthe evidence of manual labor is one of the chief sources of value in\nornament, (\"Seven Lamps,\" p.III.,)\nto which objection is made in these terms: \"We must here warn the reader\nagainst a remarkable error of Ruskin.The value of ornaments in\narchitecture depends _not in the slightest degree_ on the _manual labor_\nthey contain.If it did, the finest ornaments ever executed would be the\nstone chains that hang before certain Indian rock-temples.\"\"The value of the Cornish mines depends not in\nthe slightest degree on the quantity of copper they contain.If it did,\nthe most valuable things ever produced would be copper saucepans.\"It is\nhardly worth my while to answer this; but, lest any of my readers should\nbe confused by the objection, and as I hold the fact to be of great\nimportance, I may re-state it for them with some explanation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.Observe, then, the appearance of labor, that is to say, the evidence of\nthe past industry of man, is always, in the abstract, intensely\ndelightful: man being meant to labor, it is delightful to see that he\n_has_ labored, and to read the record of his active and worthy\nexistence.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the garden.The evidence of labor becomes painful only when it is a _sign of Evil\ngreater, as Evil, than the labor is great, as Good_.As, for instance,\nif a man has labored for an hour at what might have been done by another\nman in a moment, this evidence of his labor is also evidence of his\nweakness; and this weakness is greater in rank of evil, than his\nindustry is great in rank of good.Again, if a man have labored at what was not worth accomplishing, the\nsigns of his labor are the signs of his folly, and his folly dishonors\nhis industry; we had rather he had been a wise man in rest than a fool\nin labor.Again, if a man have labored without accompl", "question": "Where is the football?

wherever it substitutes\nitself for these, or _negatives these by its existence_, then it is\npositive evil.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.Copper is an evil when it alloys gold, or poisons food:\nnot an evil, as copper;

that which man can create\nwithout toil is worthless: machine ornaments are no ornaments at all.Consider this carefully, reader: I could illustrate it for you\nendlessly; but you feel it yourself every hour of your existence.And if\nyou do not know that you feel it, take up, for a little time, the trade\nwhich of all manual trades has been most honored: be for once a\ncarpenter.Make for yourself a table or a chair, and see if you ever\nthought any table or chair so delightful, and what strange beauty there\nwill be in their crooked limbs.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the garden.I have not noticed any other animadversions on the \"Seven Lamps\" in Mr.Garbett's volume; but if there be more, I must now leave it to his own\nconsideration, whether he may not, as in the above instances, have made\nthem incautiously: I may, perhaps, also be permitted to request other\narchitects, who may happen to glance at the preceding pages, not\nimmediately to condemn what may appear to them false in general\nprinciple.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple.I must often be found deficient in technical knowledge; I\nmay often err in my statements respecting matters of practice or of\nspecial law.But I do not write thoughtlessly respecting principles; and\nmy statements of these will generally be found worth reconnoitring\nbefore attacking.Architects, no doubt, fancy they have strong grounds\nfor supposing me wrong when they seek to invalidate my assertions.Let\nme assure them, at least, that I mean to be their friend, although they\nmay not immediately recognise me as such.If I could obtain the public\near, and the principles I have advocated were carried into general\npractice, porphyry and serpentine would be given to them instead of\nlimestone and brick; instead of tavern and shop-fronts they would have\nto build goodly churches and noble dwelling-houses; and for every\nstunted Grecism and stucco Romanism, into which they are now forced to\nshape their palsied thoughts, and to whose crumbling plagiarisms they\nmust trust their doubtful fame, they would be asked to raise whole\nstreets of bold, and rich, and living architecture, with the certainty\nin their hearts of doing what was honorable to themselves, and good for\nall men.Before I altogether leave the question of the influence of labor on\narchitectural effect, the reader may expect from me a word or two\nrespecting the subject which this year must be interesting to all--the\napplicability, namely, of glass and iron to architecture in general, as\nin some sort exemplified by the Crystal Palace.It is thought by many that we shall forthwith have great part of our\narchitecture in glass and iron, and that new forms of beauty will result\nfrom the studied employment of these materials.It may be told in a few words how far this is possible; how far\neternally impossible.There are two means of delight in all productions of art--color and\nform.The most vivid conditions of color attainable by human art are those of\nworks in glass and enamel, but not the most perfect.The best and\nnoblest coloring possible to art is that attained by the touch of the\nhuman hand on an opaque surface, upon which it can command any tint\nrequired, without subjection to alteration by fire or other mechanical\nmeans.No color is so noble as the color of a good painting on canvas or\ngesso.This kind of color being, however, impossible, for the most part, in\narchitecture, the next best is the scientific disposition of the natural\ncolors of stones, which are far nobler than any abstract hues producible\nby human art.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football.The delight which we receive from glass painting is one altogether\ninferior, and in which we should degrade ourselves by over indulgence.Nevertheless, it is possible that we may raise some palaces like\nAladdin's with  glass for jewels, which shall be new in the annals\nof human splendor, and good in their place; but not if they superseded\nnobler edifices.Now, color is producible either on opaque or in transparent bodies: but\nform is only expressible, in its perfection, on opaque bodies, without\nlustre.This law is imperative, universal, irrevocable.No perfect or refined\nform can be expressed except in opaque and lustreless matter.You cannot\nsee the form of a jewel, nor, in any perfection, even of a cameo or\nbronze.You cannot perfectly see the form of a humming-bird, on account\nof its burnishing; but you can see the form of a swan perfectly.No noble\nwork in form can ever, therefore, be produced in transparent or lustrous\nglass or enamel.All noble architecture depends for its majesty on its\nform: therefore you can never have any noble architecture in transparent\nor lustrous glass or enamel.Iron is, however, opaque; and both it and\nopaque enamel may, perhaps, be rendered quite lustreless; and, therefore,\nfit to receive noble form.Let this be thoroughly done, and both the iron and enamel made fine in\npaste or grain, and you may have an architecture as noble as cast or\nstruck architecture even can be: as noble, therefore, as coins can be, or\ncommon cast bronzes, and such other multiplicable things;[102]--eternally\nseparated from all good and great things by a gulph which not all the\ntubular bridges nor engineering of ten thousand nineteenth centuries cast\ninto one great bronze-foreheaded century, will ever overpass one inch of.All art which is worth its room in this world, all art which is not a\npiece of blundering refuse, occupying the foot or two of earth which, if\nunencumbered by it, would have grown corn or violets, or some better\nthing, is _art which proceeds from an individual mind, working through\ninstruments which assist, but do not supersede, the muscular action of\nthe human hand, upon the materials which most tenderly receive, and most\nsecurely retain, the impressions of such human labor_.And the value of every work of art is exactly in the ratio of the\nquantity of humanity which has been put into it, and legibly expressed\nupon it for ever:--\n\nFirst, of thought and moral purpose;\n\nSecondly, of technical skill;\n\nThirdly, of bodily industry.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.The quantity of bodily industry which that Crystal Palace expresses is\nvery great.The quantity of thought it expresses is, I suppose, a single and very\nadmirable thought of Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.Paxton's, probably not a bit brighter than\nthousands of thoughts which pass through his active and intelligent\nbrain every hour,--that it might be possible to build a greenhouse\nlarger than ever greenhouse was built before.This thought, and some\nvery ordinary algebra, are as much as all that glass can represent of\nhuman intellect.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.\"But one poor half-pennyworth of bread to all this\nintolerable deal of sack.\"\"The earth hath bubbles as the water hath:\n   And this is of them.\"The depth of the cutting in some of the early English capitals is,\nindeed, part of a general system of attempts at exaggerated force of\neffect, like the \"_black_ touches\" of second-rate draughtsmen, which I\nhave noticed as characteristic of nearly all northern work, associated\nwith the love of the grotesque: but the main section of the capital is\nindeed a dripstone rolled round, as above described; and dripstone\nsections are continually found in northern work, where not only they\ncannot increase force of effect, but are entirely invisible except on\nclose examination; as, for instance, under the uppermost range of stones\nof the foundation of Whitehall, or under the <DW72> of the restored base\nof All Souls College, Oxford, under the level of the eye.I much doubt\nif any of the Fellows be aware of its existence.Many readers will be surprised and displeased by the disparagement of\nthe early English capital.That capital has, indeed, one character of\nconsiderable value; namely, the boldness with which it stops the\nmouldings which fall upon it, and severs them from the shaft,\ncontrasting itself with the multiplicity of their vertical lines.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.Sparingly used, or seldom seen, it is thus, in its place, not\nunpleasing; and we English love it from association, it being always\nfound in connection with our purest and loveliest Gothic arches, and\nnever in multitudes large enough to satiate the eye with its form.The\nreader who sits in the Temple church every Sunday, and sees no\narchitecture during the week but that of Chancery Lane, may most\njustifiably quarrel with me for what I have said of it.But if every\nhouse in Fleet Street or Chancery Lane were Gothic, and all had early\nEnglish capitals, I would answer for his making peace with me in a\nfortnight.Whose they are, is of little consequence to the reader or to me, and I\nhave taken no pains to discover; their value being not in any evidence\nthey bear respecting dates, but in their intrinsic merit as examples of\ncomposition.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.Two of them are within the gate, one on the top of it, and\nthis latter is on the whole the best, though all are beautiful; uniting\nthe intense northern energy in their figure sculpture with the most\nserene classical restraint in their outlines, and unaffected, but\nmasculine simplicity of construction.I have not put letters to the diagram of the lateral arch at page 154,\nin order not to interfere with the clearness of the curves, but I shall\nalways express the same points by the same letters, whenever I have to\ngive measures of arches of this simple kind, so that the reader need\nnever have the diagrams lettered at all.The base or span of the centre\narch will always be _a b_; its vertex will always be V; the points of\nthe cusps will be _c c_; _p p_ will be the bases of perpendiculars let\nfall from V and _c_ on _a b_; and _d_ the base of a perpendicular from\nthe point of the cusp to the arch line.Then _a b_ will always be a span\nof the arch, V _p_ its perpendicular height, V _a_ the chord of its side\narcs, _d c_ the depth of its cusps, _c c_ the horizontal interval\nbetween the cusps, _a c_ the length of the chord of the lower arc of the\ncusp, V _c_ the length of the chord of the upper arc of the cusp,\n(whether continuous or not,) and _c p_ the length of a perpendicular\nfrom the point of the cusp on _a b_.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.Of course we do not want all these measures for a single arch, but it\noften happens that some of them are attainable more easily than others;\nsome are often unattainable altogether, and it is necessary therefore to\nhave expressions for whichever we may be able to determine.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.V _p_ or V _a_, _a b_, and _d c_ are always essential;

'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some\nbrigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,\nand the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving\nthe city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the\nnext morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred\nFrench were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with\nthe garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,\nafter twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and\nas many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle\nkilled, besides the casualties in the city.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with\nothers, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on\naccount of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people\nfrom destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,\n'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and\npreventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to\nsave, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained\nEuropeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the\ncaptain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the\nMoorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the\nBritish and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even\nperemptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,\nupon the cruel sophism that, \"The Christian religion asserts the husband\nand wife to be one, consequently,\" added the Governor, \"as it is my\nduty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving\nMogador, I must also keep his wife.\"The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,\nthought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in\nsome way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the\ncity, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would\nsay, \"Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves.\"During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their\nbest gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became\ndispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,\nabout sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly\nall the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and\nthe European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to\ndefend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves\nof famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the\nFrench, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These\nwretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages\naround, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of\nthe most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,\nassaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding\nthe more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in\nthe Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise\nexposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his\nwife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential\nwas their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent\nconfusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers\nappeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by\nhundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking\nplaces for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their\nrapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular\ndocuments.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and\nothers setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and\nlicentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it\nwas that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight\nthrough the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding\nband, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,\ninsisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her\nthroat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would\nthe ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul\nhaving prudently resolved to take no money with them.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.Fortunately, at\nthis juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born\nhere, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force\nto her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the\nblood of their countrywomen.The chief of\nthe party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in\ncontact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which\nthe Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative\nsecurity.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad\nforebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but\nnot before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a\nsabre-blow at him to cut him down;

and, besides, having\nfound two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly\nlaunched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he\nexcited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat\ncame and took him on board.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the\nbatteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the\ncity, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the\nrescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville\nafterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.The\nself-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent\nyoung man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the\nBritish Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her\nfamily were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews\nand natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,\nlike many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and\na Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the\nsack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,\nand all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding\nPrince, \"Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,\nand thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!\"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place\nand this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of\nall kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and\nhardware of every description;

and, to the despotism and exactions of these and\nmost governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the\nnumbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,\nwholly, or in part.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty\nyears uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have\nfinally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron\nlay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once\nmerchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a\nschooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels\nwere said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the\nrock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable\ntoll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever\nsince been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on\nEuropean navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage\nin war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and\nactive friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess\nourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in\nthe neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be\nof Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when\ncommerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually\nwritten by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal\npalace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of\nSilda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense\nquantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--\"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of\nthat name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who\nalways speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the\nwhole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the\ncourt of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less\nauthentic than the opinions given by Cas<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.", "question": "Where is the apple?

is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with\nlittle brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,\nwith each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are\nwhitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is\nattacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a\nhalf long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want

November of her life was near.\"I must soon face my fate, and I must be true to Amy.\"Hargrove regarded with discontent the prospect of another long\nmountain expedition; but Fred, her idol, was wild for it, and in a day or\ntwo he must return to school in the city, from which, at his earnest\nplea, he had been absent too long already; so she smiled her farewell at\nlast upon the fateful excursion.He, with his sister, was soon at the Cliffords', and found the\nrockaway--the strong old carryall with which Gertrude already had tender\nassociations--in readiness.Maggie had agreed to chaperon the party,\nlittle Ned having been easily bribed to remain with his father.Miss Hargrove had looked wistfully at the Clifford mansion as she drew\nnear to it.Never had it appeared to her more home-like, with its\nembowering trees and laden orchards.The bright hues of the foliage\nsuggested the hopes that centred there: the ocean, as she had seen\nit--cold and gray under a clouded sky--was emblematic of life with no\nfulfilment of those hopes.Clifford met her at the door, and\ntook her in to see the invalid, who greeted her almost as affectionately\nas she would have welcomed Amy after absence, Miss Hargrove knew in the\ndepths of her heart how easily she could be at home there.Never did a pleasure-party start under brighter auspices.Clifford came out, on her husband's arm, to wave them a farewell.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.The young men had their alpenstocks, for it was their intention to walk\nup the steep places.Webb was about to take Alf and Johnnie on the front\nseat with him, when Amy exclaimed: \"I'm going to drive, Mr.Johnnie\ncan sit between us, and keep me company when you are walking.You needn't\nthink that because you are the brilliant author of this expedition you\nare going to have everything your own way.\"Indeed, not a little guile lurked behind her laughing eyes, which ever\nkept Webb in perplexity--though he looked into them so often--as to\nwhether they were blue or gray.Miss Hargrove demurely took her seat with\nMaggie, and Burt had the two boys with him.Fred had brought his gun, and\nwas vigilant for game now that the \"law was up.\"They soon reached the foot of the mountain, and there was a general\nunloading, for at first every one wished to walk.Maggie good-naturedly\nclimbed around to the front seat and took the reins, remarking that she\nwould soon have plenty of company again.Burt had not recognized Amy's tactics, nor did he at once second them,\neven unconsciously.His long ruminations had led to the only possible\nconclusion--the words he had spoken must be made good.Pride and honor\npermitted no other course.Therefore he proposed to-day to be ubiquitous,\nand as gallant to Maggie as to the younger ladies.When Miss Hargrove\nreturned to the city he would quietly prove his loyalty.Never before had\nhe appeared in such spirits; never so inexorably resolute.He recalled\nAmy's incredulous laugh at his protestation of constancy, and felt that\nhe could never look her in the face if he faltered.It was known that\nMiss Hargrove had received much attention, and her interest in him would\nbe likely to disappear at once should she learn of his declaration of\nundying devotion to another but a few months before.He anathematized\nhimself, but determined that his weakness should remain unknown.It was\nevident that Amy had been a little jealous, but probably that she did not\nyet care enough for him to be very sensitive on the subject.He had pledged himself to wait until she did care.Miss Hargrove should be made\nto believe that she had added much to the pleasure of the excursion, and\nthere he would stop.And Burt on his mettle was no bungler.The test\nwould come in his staying powers.He had not watched and thought so long\nin vain.He had seen Burt's expression the evening before, and knew that\na wakeful night had followed.His own feeling had taught him a\nclairvoyance which enabled him to divine not a little of what was passing\nin his brother's mind and that of Miss Hargrove.Her frank, sisterly affection was not love, and might never\nbecome love.One of the objects of the expedition was to obtain an abundant supply of\nautumn leaves and ferns for pressing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.\"I intend to make the old house\nlook like a bower this winter,\" Amy remarked.\"That would be impossible with our city home,\" Miss Hargrove said, \"and\nmamma would not hear of such an attempt.But I can do as I please in my\nown room, and shall gather my country _souvenirs_ to-day.\"The idea of decorating her apartment with feathery ferns and bright-hued\nleaves took a strong hold upon her fancy, for she hoped that Burt would\naid her in making the collection.Nor was she disappointed, for Amy said:\n\n\"Burt, I have gathered and pressed nearly all the ferns I need already.You know the shady nooks where the most delicate ones grow, and you can\nhelp Gertrude make as good a collection as mine.You'll help too, won't\nyou, Webb?\"added the innocent little schemer, who saw that Burt was\nlooking at her rather keenly.So they wound up the mountain, making long stops here and there to gather\nsylvan trophies and to note the fine views.Amy's manner was so cordial\nand natural that Burt's suspicions had been allayed, and the young\nfellow, who could do nothing by halves, was soon deeply absorbed in\nmaking a superb collection for Miss Hargrove, and she felt that, whatever\nhappened, she was being enriched by everything he obtained for her.Amy\nhad brought a great many newspapers folded together so that leaves could\nbe placed between the pages, and Webb soon noted that his offerings were\nkept separate from those of Burt.The latter tried to be impartial in his\nlabors in behalf of the two girls, bringing Amy bright-hued leaves\ninstead of ferns, but did not wholly succeed, and sometimes he found\nhimself alone with Miss Hargrove as they pursued their search a short\ndistance on some diverging and shaded path.On one of these occasions he\nsaid, \"I like to think how beautiful you will make your room this\nwinter.\"\"I like to think of it too,\" she replied.\"I shall feel that I have a\npart of my pleasant summer always present.\"\"I should think you would find it exceedingly dull after such brilliant\nexperiences as that of your yachting excursion.\"\"But I am used to the quiet country, and a day like this is the\nexception.\"\"I do not imagine you have ever lived a tame life.\"\"Isn't that about the same as calling me wild?\"\"There's no harm in beginning a little in that way.\"You are so favored that I can scarcely imagine life bringing sobering\nexperiences to you very soon.\"Have you forgotten what occurred on these very mountains, at no\ngreat distance?I assure you I never forget it;\" and her eyes were\neloquent as she turned them upon him.\"One does not forget the most fortunate event of one's life.Since you\nwere to meet that danger, I would not have missed being near for the\nworld.I had even a narrower escape, as you know, on this mountain.The\nspot where Webb found me is scarcely more than a mile away.\"She looked at him very wistfully, and her face grew pale, but she only\nsaid, \"I don't think either of us can forget the Highlands.\"\"I shall never forget that little path,\" he said, in a low tone, and he\nlooked back at it lingeringly as they came out into the road and\napproached the rest of the party.That\nspot should be marked for future supplies.Miss Hargrove will share with\nyou, for you can't have anything so fine as this.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.\"Yes, indeed I have, and I shall call you and Webb to account if you do\nnot to-day make Gertrude fare as well.\"Both Miss Hargrove and Burt were bewildered.There was lurking mischief\nin Amy's eyes when she first spoke, and yet she used her influence to\nkeep Burt in her friend's society.Her spirits seemed too exuberant to be\nnatural, and Miss Hargrove, who was an adept at hiding her feelings under\na mask of gayety, surmised that Amy's feminine instincts had taught her\nto employ the same tactics.Conscious of their secret, Miss Hargrove and\nBurt both thought, \"Perhaps it is her purpose to throw us together as far\nas possible, and learn the truth.\"Amy had a kinder purpose than they imagined.She wanted no more of Burt's\nforced allegiance, and was much too good-natured to permit mere pique to\ncause unhappiness to others.\"Let Gertrude win him if she cares for him,\"\nwas her thought, \"and if _she_ can't hold him his case is\n_hopeless_.\"She could not resist the temptation, however, to tease\nBurt a little.But he gave her slight chance for the next few hours.Her mirthful\nquestion and the glance accompanying it had put him on his guard again,\nand he at once became the gay cavalier-general he had resolved on being\nthroughout the day.They made a long pause to enjoy the view looking out upon Constitution\nIsland, West Point, the southern mountains, and the winding river, dotted\nhere and there with sails, and with steamers, seemingly held motionless\nby their widely separated train of canal boats.\"What mountain is this that we are now to descend?\"\"It's the first high mountain that abuts on\nthe river above West Point, you will remember.\"I have a song relating to it, and will give you a\nverse;\" and she sang:\n\n  \"'Where Hudson's waves o'er silvery sands\n      Wind through the hills afar,\n    And Cro' Nest like a monarch stands,\n      Crowned with a single star.'\"After a round of applause had subsided, Burt, whose eyes had been more\ndemonstrative than his hands, said, \"That's by Morris.We can see from\nFort Putnam his old home under Mount Taurus.\"He is the poet who entreated the woodman to'spare that tree.'\"\"Which the woodman will never do,\" Webb remarked, \"unless compelled by\nlaw; nor even then, I fear.\"cried Amy, \"with what a thump you drop into prose!\"\"I also advise an immediate descent of the mountain if we are to have any\ntime at Fort Putnam,\" he added.They were soon winding down the S's by which the road overcame the steep\ndeclivity.On reaching a plateau, before the final descent, they came\nacross a wretched hovel, gray and storm-beaten, with scarcely strength to\nstand.Rags took the place of broken glass in the windows.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.A pig was\nrooting near the doorstep, on which stood a slatternly woman, regarding\nthe party with dull curiosity.\"Talk about the elevating influence of mountain scenery,\" said Miss\nHargrove; \"there's a commentary on the theory.\"\"Their height above tide-water\nand the amount of bad whiskey they consume keep our mountaineers elevated\nmost of the time.\"\"Does Lumley live in a place like that?\"\"He did--in a worse one, if possible,\" Webb replied for Amy, who\nhesitated.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.He now has a good\nvegetable garden fenced in, a rustic porch covered with American ivy,\nand--would you believe it?--an actual flower-bed.Within the hut there\nare two pictures on the wall, and the baby creeps on a carpeted floor.Lumley says Amy is making a man of him.\"\"You forget to mention how much you have helped me,\" Amy added.\"Come, let us break up this mutual admiration society,\" said Burt.\"I'm\nready for lunch already, and Fort Putnam is miles away.\"The road from the foot of the mountain descends gradually through wild,\nbeautiful scenery to West Point.Cro' Nest rises abruptly on the left,\nand there is a wooded valley on the right, with mountains beyond.The\ntrees overhung the road with a canopy of gold, emerald, and crimson\nfoliage, and the sunlight came to the excursionists as through\nstained-glass windows.Taking a side street at the back of the military\npost, they soon reached a point over which frowned the ruins of the fort,\nand here they left their horses.After a brief climb to the northward\nthey entered on an old road, grass-grown and leaf-carpeted, and soon\npassed through the gaping sally-port, on either side of which cone-like\ncedars stood as sentinels.Within the fort Nature had been busy for a\ncentury softening and obliterating the work of man.Cedar trees--some of\nwhich were dying from", "question": "Where is the milk?

extensive ruins are seen by turning sharply to the left from the\nsally-port.Here, yawning like caverns, their entrances partially choked\nby the debris, are six casemates, or vaults.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.They were built of brick,\ncovered with stone, and are eighteen feet deep and twelve wide, with an\narched roof twelve feet high.On the level rampart above them were long,\nwithered grass, the wild dwarf-rose, and waving golden-rod.The outer\nwalls, massy and crumbling, or half torn away by vandal hands, were built\nin angles, according to the engineering science of the Revolution, except\non the west, where the high ramparts surmount a mural perpendicular\nprecipice fifty feet in height.Inland, across the valley, the mountains\nwere seen, rising like rounded billows in every direction, while from the\nnorth, east, and south the windings of the Hudson were visible for\nfifteen miles.All but Amy had visited the spot before, and Burt explored the place with\nher while the rest prepared for lunch.She had asked Gertrude to\naccompany them, but the latter had sought refuge with Maggie, and at her\nside she proposed to remain.She scarcely dared trust herself with Burt,\nand as the day advanced he certainly permitted his eyes to express an\ninterest that promised ill for his inexorable purpose of constancy.It had become clear to Miss Hargrove that he was restrained by something\nthat had occurred between him and Amy, and both her pride and her sense\nof truth to her friend decided her to withdraw as far as possible from\nhis society, and to return to the city.She and Burt vied with each other in gayety at lunch.When it was over\nthey all grouped themselves in the shade of a clump of cedars, and looked\naway upon the wide prospect, Webb pointing out objects of past and\npresent interest.Alf and Fred speedily grew restless and started off\nwith the gun, Johnnie's head sank into her mother's lap, Miss Hargrove\nand Burt grew quiet and preoccupied, their eyes looking off into vacancy.Webb was saying, \"By one who had imagination how much more could be seen\nfrom this point than meets the eye!There, on the plain below us, would\nrise the magnificent rustic colonnade two hundred and twenty feet long\nand eighty feet wide, beneath which Washington gave the great banquet in\nhonor of the birth of the Dauphin of France, and on the evening of the\nsame day these hills blazed with musketry and rolled back the thunder of\ncannon with which the festivities of the evening were begun.Think of

Shippen, you remember, and told\nher of his awful peril, then rushed away, leaving the poor, terror-stricken\nwoman unconscious on the floor.Would you not like to look through the\nglass at the house where the tragedy occurred, Miss Hargrove?\"At the sound of her name the young girl started visibly, and Webb saw\nthat there were tears in her eyes; but she complied without a word, and\nhe so directed the glass that it covered the historic mansion.thought innocent Webb, taking her\nquickly suppressed emotion as a tribute to his moving reminiscences.\"Oh, Webb, have done with your lugubrious ancient history!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.\"It's time we were getting ready for a homeward move,\" said Maggie.\"And I'll help you,\" added Miss Hargrove, hastily following her.\"Let me look at the house, too,\" said Amy, taking the glass; then added,\nafter a moment: \"Poor Margaret Arnold!It was indeed a tragedy, as you\nsaid, Webb--a sadder one than these old military preparations can\nsuggest.In all his career of war and treachery Arnold never inflicted a\nmore cruel wound.\"\"Yes,\" said Amy, quietly, \"she was evidently feeling deeply.\"Her thought\nwas, \"I don't believe she heard a word that Webb said.\"Then, seeing that\nBurt was helping Maggie and Miss Hargrove, she added, \"Please point out\nto me some other interesting places.\"Webb, well pleased, talked on to a listener who did not give him her\nwhole attention.She could not forget Gertrude's paleness, and her\nalternations from extreme gayety to a look of such deep sadness as to\nawaken not a little sympathetic curiosity.Amy loved her friend truly,\nand it did not seem strange to her that Miss Hargrove was deeply\ninterested in Burt, since they had been much thrown together, and since\nshe probably owed her life to him.Amy's resentment toward Burt had\npassed away.She had found that her pride, merely, and not her heart, was\nwounded by his new passion, and she already began to feel that she never\ncould have any such regard for him as her friend was possibly cherishing.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.Therefore it was, perhaps, not unnatural that her tranquil regard should\nprove unsatisfying to Burt in contrast with the passion of which Miss\nHargrove was capable.She had seen his vain efforts to remain loyal, and\nhad smiled at them, proposing to let matters take their course, and to\ngive little aid in extricating him from his dilemma.But, if she had\ninterpreted her friend's face aright, she could no longer stand aloof, an\namused and slightly satirical spectator.If Burt deserved some\npunishment, Gertrude did not, and she was inclined to guess the cause of\nthe latter's haste to return to the city.It may thus be seen that Amy was fast losing her unsophisticated\ngirlhood.While Burt's passionate words had awakened no corresponding\nfeeling, they had taught her that she was no longer a child, since she\ncould inspire such words.Her intimacy with Miss Hargrove, and the\nlatter's early confidences, had enlarged her ideas on some subjects.As\nthe bud of a flower passes slowly through long and apparently slow stages\nof immaturity and at last suddenly opens to the light, so she had reached\nthat age when a little experience suggests a great deal, and the\ninfluences around her tended to develop certain thoughts very rapidly.She saw that her friend had not been brought up in English seclusion.Admirers by the score had flocked around her, and, as she had often said,\nshe proposed to marry for love.\"I have the name of being cold,\" she once\ntold Amy, \"but I know I can love as can few others, and I shall know it\nwell when I do love, too.\"The truth was daily growing clearer to Amy\nthat under our vivid American skies the grand passion is not a fiction of\nromance or a quiet arrangement between the parties concerned.Miss Hargrove had not misjudged herself.Her tropical nature, when once\nkindled, burned with no feeble, wavering flame.She had passed the point\nof criticism of Burt.She loved him, and to her fond eyes he seemed more\nworthy of her love than any man she had ever before known.But she had\nnot passed beyond her sense of truth and duty, and the feeling came to\nher that she must go away at once and engage in that most pathetic of all\nstruggles that fall to woman's lot.As the conviction grew clear on this\nbright October day, she felt that her heart was bleeding internally.Tears would come into her eyes at the dreary prospect.Her former\nbrilliant society life now looked as does an opera-house in the morning,\nwhen the gilding and tinsel that flashed and sparkled the evening before\nare seen to be dull and tarnished.Burt had appeared to especial\nadvantage in his mountain home.His\ntall, fine figure and unconscious, easy manner were as full of grace as\ndeficient in conventionality, and she thought with disgust of many of her\nformer admirers, who were nothing if not stylish after the arbitrary mode\nof the hour.At the same time he had proved that he could be at home in a\ndrawing-room on the simple ground of good-breeding, and not because he\nhad been run through fashion's latest mold.The grand scenery around her\nsuggested the manhood that kindled her imagination--a manhood strong,\nfearless, and not degenerated from that sturdy age which had made these\nscenes historic.By the time they were ready to start homeward the southern side of Cro'\nNest was in deep blue shadow.They bowled along rapidly till they came to\nthe steep ascent, and then the boys and the young men sprang out.\"Would\nyou like to walk, Gertrude?\"Amy asked, for she was bent on throwing her\nfriend and Burt together during the witching twilight that was coming on\napace.\"I fear I am too tired, unless the load is heavy,\" she replied.\"It does not take long to reach the top of\nthe mountain on this side, and then it's chiefly down hill the rest of\nthe way.\"Amy, who had been sitting with Webb and Johnnie as before, said to Miss\nHargrove, \"Won't you step across the seats and keep me company?\"She was so utterly unhappy that she\nwished to be left to herself as far as possible.In her realization of a\nloss that seemed immeasurable, she was a little resentful toward Amy,\nfeeling that she had been more frank and confidential than her friend.If\nAmy had claims on Burt, why had she not spoken of them?why had she\npermitted her for whom she professed such strong friendship to drift\nalmost wholly unwarned upon so sad a fate?and why was she now clearly\ntrying to bring together Burt and the one to whom even he felt that he\nhad no right to speak in more than a friendly manner?While she was\nmaking such immense sacrifices to be true, she felt that Amy was\nmaintaining an unfair reticence, if not actually beguiling herself and\nBurt into a display of weakness for which they would be condemned--or, at\nleast, he would be, and love identifies itself with its object.These\nthoughts, having once been admitted, grew upon her mind rapidly, for it\nis hard to suffer through another and maintain a gentle charity.Therefore she was silent when she took her seat by Amy, and when the\nlatter gave her a look that was like a caress, she did not return it.\"You are tired, Gertrude,\" Amy began gently.You\nmust stay with me to-night, and I'll watch over you like Sairy Gamp.\"So far from responding to Amy's playful and friendly words, Miss Hargrove\nsaid, hastily,\n\n\"Oh, no, I had better go right on home.I don't feel very well, and shall\nbe better at home; and I must begin to get ready to-morrow for my return\nto the city.\"Amy would not be repulsed, but, putting her arm around her friend, she\nlooked into her eyes, and asked:\n\n\"Why are you so eager to return to New York?Are you tiring of your\ncountry friends?You certainly told me that you expected to stay till\nNovember.\"\"Fred must go back to school to-morrow,\" said Gertrude, in a constrained\nvoice, \"and I do not think it is well to leave him alone in the city\nhouse.\"\"You are withdrawing your confidence from me,\" said Amy, sadly.If you had, I should not be the unhappy girl I am-to-night.Well,\nsince you wish to know the whole truth you shall.You said you could\ntrust me implicitly, and I promised to deserve your trust.If you had\nsaid to me that Burt was bound to you when I told you that I was\nheart-whole and fancy-free, I should have been on my guard.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Is it natural\nthat I should be indifferent to the man who risked his life to save mine?Why have you left me so long in his society without a hint of warning?I shall not try to snatch happiness from\nanother.\"Johnnie's tuneful little voice was piping a song, and the rumble of the\nwheels over a stony road prevented Maggie, on the last seat, from hearing\nanything.\"Now you _shall_ stay with me\nto-night,\" she said.See, Burt has\nturned, and is coming toward us.I pledge you my word he can never be to\nme more than a brother.I do not love him except as a brother, and never\nhave, and you can snatch no happiness from me, except by treating me with\ndistrust and going away.\"\"Oh, Amy,\" began Miss Hargrove, in tones and with a look that gave\nevidence of the chaotic bewilderment of her mind.We are not very lonely, thank you, Mr.You look, as far as I\ncan see you through the dusk, as if you were commiserating us as poor\nforlorn creatures, but we have some resources within ourselves.\"We are the forlorn creatures who have\nno resources.I assure you we are very simple,\nhonest people.\"\"In that case I shall have no fears, but clamber in at once.I feel as if\nI had been on a twenty-mile tramp.\"\"What an implied compliment to our exhilarating society!\"\"Indeed there is--a very strong one.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.I've been so immensely exhilarated\nthat, in the re-action, I'm almost faint.\"\"Maggie,\" cried Amy, \"do take care of Burt; he's going to faint.\"\"He must wait till we come to the next brook, and then we'll put him in\nit.\"\"Webb,\" said Amy, looking over her shoulder at the young man, who was now\nfollowing the carriage, \"is there anything the matter with you, also?\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.\"Oh, your trouble, whatever it may be, is chronic.Well, well, to think\nthat we poor women may be the only survivors of this tremendous\nexpedition.\"\"That would be most natural--the survival of the fittest, you know.\"Science is uppermost in your mind, as\never.You ought to live a thousand years, Webb, to see the end of all\nyour theories.\"\"I fear it wouldn't be the millennium for me, and that I should have more\nperplexing theories at its end than now.\"\"That's the way with men--they are never satisfied,\" remarked Miss\nHargrove.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Clifford, this is your expedition, and it's getting so\ndark that I shall feel safer if you are driving.\"\"Oh, Gertrude, you have no confidence in me whatever.As if I would break\nyour neck--or heart either!\"\"You are a very mysterious little woman,\" was the reply, given in like\nmanner, \"and need hours of explanation.\"Clifford,\nI've much more confidence in you than in Amy.Her talk is so giddy that I\nwant a sober hand on the reins.\"\"I want one to drive who can see his way, not feel it,\" was the laughing\nresponse.Amy, too, was laughing silently, as she reined in the horses.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.\"What are you\ntwo girls giggling about?\"\"The\nidea of two such refined creatures giggling!\"\"Well,\" exclaimed Webb, \"what am I to do?I can't stand up between you\nand drive.\"\"Gertrude, you must clamber around and sustain Burt's drooping spirits.\"\"Indeed, Amy, you must know best how to do that,\" was the reply.\"As\nguest, I claim a little of the society of the commander-in-chief.\"I'll solve the vexed question,\" said Burt, much nettled, and leaping\nout.\"Now, Burt, the question isn't vexed, and don't you be,\" cried Amy,\nspringing lightly over to the next seat.\"There are Fred and Alf, too,\nwith the gun.Let us all get home as soon as possible, for it's nearly\ntime for supper already.Come, I shall feel much hurt", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.Burt at once realized the absurdity of showing pique, although he felt\nthat there was something in the air which he did not understand.He came\nback laughing, with much apparent good-nature, and saying, \"I thought I'd\nsoon bring one or the other of you to terms.\"said Amy, with difficulty restraining a\nnew burst of merriment.They soon reached the summit, and paused to give the horses a breathing.The young moon hung in the west, and its silver crescent symbolized to\nMiss Hargrove the hope that was growing in her heart.\"Amy,\" she said,\n\"don't you remember the song we arranged from 'The Culprit Fay'?We\ncertainly should sing it here on this mountain.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.Amy sang, in clear soprano:\n\n  \"'The moon looks down on old Cro' Nest,\n  She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast,\n  And seems his huge gray form to throw\n  In a silver cone on the wave below.'\"\"Imagine the cone and wave, please,\" said Miss Hargrove; and then, in an\nalto rich with her heart's deep feeling, she sang with Amy:\n\n  \"'Ouphe and goblin!Ye that love the moon's soft light,\n    Hither--hither wend your way;\n    Twine ye in a jocund ring;\n    Sing and trip it merrily,\n    Hand to hand and wing to wing,\n    Round the wild witch-hazel tree.'\"\"If I were a goblin, I'd come, for music like that,\" cried Burt, as they\nstarted rapidly homeward.\"You are much too big to suggest a culprit fay,\" said Amy.\"But the description of the fay's charmer is your portrait,\" he replied,\nin a low tone:\n\n  \"'But well I know her sinless mind\n    Is pure as the angel forms above,\n    Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind,\n    Such as a spirit well might love.'\"\"Oh, no; you are mistaken, I'm not meek in the least.Think of the\npunishment:\n\n  \"'Tied to the hornet's shardy wings,\n    Toss'd on the pricks of nettles' stings;'\n\nyou know the rest.\"\"What witchery has got into you to-night, Amy?\"\"That last song was so good that I, for one, would be glad of more,\" cried\nWebb.\"You men must help us, then,\" said Miss Hargrove, and in a moment the wild,\ndim forest was full of melody, the rocks and highlands sending back soft\nand unheeded echoes.Burt, meantime, was occupied with disagreeable reflections.Perhaps both\nthe girls at last understood him, and had been comparing notes, to his\ninfinite disadvantage.His fickleness and the dilemma he was in may have\nbecome a jest between them.Resentment, except against\nhimself, was impossible.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.If Amy understood him, in what other way could\nshe meet any approach to sentiment on his part than by a laughing scorn?If Miss Hargrove had divined the past, or had received a hint concerning\nit, why should she not shun his society?He was half-desperate, and yet\nfelt that any show of embarrassment or anger would only make him appear\nmore ridiculous.The longer he thought the more sure he was that the\ngirls were beginning to guess his position, and that his only course was\na polite indifference to both.But this policy promised to lead through a\nthorny path, and to what?In impotent rage at himself he ground his teeth\nduring the pauses between the stanzas that he was compelled to sing.Such\nwas the discord in his heart that he felt like uttering notes that would\nmake \"night hideous.\"He was still more distraught when, on their return, they found Mr.Hargrove's carriage in waiting, and Amy, after a brief conference with\nher friend in her room, came down prepared to accompany Miss Hargrove\nhome after supper.In spite of all his efforts at ease and gayety, his\nembarrassment and trouble were evident.He had observed Miss Hargrove's\npallor and her effort to keep up at Fort Putnam, and could not banish the\nhope that she sympathized with him; but now the young girl was demurely\nradiant.Her color had come again, and the lustre of her beautiful eyes\nwas dazzling.Yet they avoided his, and she had far more to say to Webb\nand the others than to him.Webb, too, was perplexed, for during the day\nAmy had been as bewildering to him as to Burt.But he was in no\nuncertainty as to his course, which was simply to wait.He, with Burt,\nsaw the girls to the carriage, and the latter said good-night rather\ncoldly and stiffly.Alf and Fred parted regretfully, with the promise of\na correspondence which would be as remarkable for its orthography as for\nits natural history.CHAPTER LII\n\nBURT'S SORE DILEMMA\n\n\nMr.Hargrove greeted Amy cordially, but his questioning eyes rested\noftenest on his daughter.Her expression and manner caused him to pace\nhis study long and late that night.Hargrove was very polite and a\nlittle stately.She felt that she existed on a plane above Amy.The young girls soon pleaded fatigue, and retired.Once in the seclusion\nof their room they forgot all about their innocent fib, and there was not\na trace of weariness in their manner.While Burt was staring at his\ndismal, tangled fortune, seeing no solution of his difficulties, a\nfateful conference relating to him was taking place.Amy did not look\nlike a scorner, as with a sister's love and a woman's tact she pleaded\nhis cause and palliated his course to one incapable of harsh judgment.But she felt that she must be honest with her friend, and that the whole\ntruth would be best and safest.Her conclusion was: \"No man who loved\n_you_, and whom you encouraged, would ever change.I know now that I\nnever had a particle of such feeling as you have for Burt, and can see\nthat I naturally chilled and quenched his regard for me.\"Miss Hargrove's dark eyes flashed ominously as she spoke of Burt or of\nany man proving faithless after she had given encouragement.\"But it wasn't possible for me to give him any real encouragement,\" Amy\npersisted.\"I've never felt as you do, and am not sure that I want to for\na long time.\"Miss Hargrove almost said, but she suppressed the\nwords, feeling that since he had not revealed his secret she had no right\nto do so.Indeed, as she recalled how sedulously he had guarded it she\nwas sure he would not thank her for suggesting it to Amy before she was\nready for the knowledge.Impetuous as Miss Hargrove was at times, she had\ntoo fine a nature to be careless of the rights and feelings of others.Moreover, she felt that Webb had been her ally, whether consciously or\nnot, and he should have his chance with all the help she could give him,\nbut she was wise enough to know that obtrusion and premature aid are\noften disastrous.The decision, after this portentous conference, was: \"Mr.Bart must seek\nme, and seek very zealously.I know you well enough Amy, to be sure that\nyou will give him no hints.It's bad enough to love a man before I've\nbeen asked to do so.What an utterly perverse and unmanageable thing\none's heart is!I shall do no angling, however, nor shall I permit any.\"\"You may stand up straight, Gertrude,\" said Amy, laughing, \"but don't\nlean over backward.\"Yes, the\nGeneral would give the Governor a safe-conduct into St.Louis, but\nhis Excellency must come to the General.His Excellency came, and the\nGeneral deigned to go with the Union leader to the Planters House.Conference, five hours; result, a safe-conduct for the Governor back.And this is how General Lyon ended the talk.His words, generously\npreserved by a Confederate colonel who accompanied his Excellency,\ndeserve to be writ in gold on the National Annals.\"Rather than concede to the state of Missouri the right to demand that\nmy Government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops\ninto the state whenever it pleases; or move its troops at its own will\ninto, out of, or through, the state; rather than concede to the state of\nMissouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my Government in\nany matter, however unimportant, I would\" (rising and pointing in turn\nto every one in the room) \"see you, and you, and you, and you, and every\nman, woman, and child in this state, dead and buried.\"Then, turning\nto the Governor, he continued, \"This means war.In an hour one of my\nofficers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines.\"And thus, without another word, without an inclination of the head, he\nturned upon his heel and strode out of the room, rattling his spurs and\nclanking his sabre.In less than two months that indomitable leader was\nlying dead beside Wilson's Creek, among the oaks on Bloody Hill.What he\nwould have been to this Union, had God spared him, we shall never know.He saved Missouri, and won respect and love from the brave men who\nfought against him.What prayers rose to heaven,\nand curses sank to hell, when the news of them came to the city by\nthe river!Flags were made by loving fingers, and shirts and bandages.Trembling young ladies of Union sympathies presented colors to regiments\non the Arsenal Green, or at Jefferson Barracks, or at Camp Benton to the\nnorthwest near the Fair Grounds.And then the regiments marched through\nthe streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the\nBattle Hymn were set, and those bright ensigns snapping at the front;\nbright now, and new, and crimson.But soon to be stained a darker red,\nand rent into tatters, and finally brought back and talked over and\ncried over, and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case, to\nbe revered by generations of Americans to confer What can stir the\nsoul more than the sight of those old flags, standing in ranks like\nthe veterans they are, whose duty has been nobly done?The blood of the\ncolor-sergeant is there, black now with age.But where are the tears of\nthe sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together?The regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats, and\npushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags.Later--much later, black headlines, and grim\nlists three columns long,--three columns of a blanket sheet!<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.\"The City\nof Alton has arrived with the following Union dead and wounded, and\nthe following Confederate wounded (prisoners).\"In a never-ceasing procession they steamed up the river; those calm\nboats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of Commerce now\nbearing the red cargoes of war.And they bore away to new battlefields\nthousands of fresh-faced boys from Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota,\ngathered at Camp Benton.Some came back with their color gone and their\nred cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken.Stephen Brice, with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat,\nwalked on the pavement beside his old company, but his look avoided\ntheir faces.He wrung Richter's hand on the landing-stage.The good German's eyes were filled as he said good-by.\"You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you,\" he said.\"Now\" (and he shrugged his shoulders), \"now have we many with no cares\nto go.I have not even a father--\" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who\nwas standing by, holding out a bony hand.\"God bless you, Carl,\" said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his\nears.He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as\nshe backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were\nthe gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the\nedge of the landing.Stephen's chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the\nJudge, he could not trust himself to speak.Back to the silent office\nwhere the shelves mocked them.The Judge closed the ground-glass door\nbehind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book.No, it was\nnot Whittlesey, but Hardee's \"Tactics.\"He shut it with a slam, and went\nto Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested\ncitizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about\nface.For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of\nthem.One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the\nwounded with an equanimity truly philosophical.When the regiments\npassed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr.Hopper did\nnot often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known\nto go to the door to bid them Godspeed.This was all very well, because\nthey were Union regiments.Hopper did not contribute a horse,\nnor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in\nthe night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them.One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office,\ntoo hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his\nmaster.The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel.Since May\nhe had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public,\nand which were so mysterious that even Mr.Hopper could not get wind\nof them.These matters had taken the Colonel out of town.But now the\nnecessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than\nGlencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.Hopper rose from\nhis chair when Mr.Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it\nuneasily.Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a\nsmile was on his face.Carvel's chair with\na semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a\nthought.He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper\nwhich had indorsements on their backs.His fine lips were tightly\nclosed, as if in pain.Hopper,\" he said, \"these Eastern notes are due this week, are they\nnot?\"\"There is no use mincing matters, Hopper.You know as well as I that\nthere is no money to pay them,\" said he, with a certain pompous attempt\nat severity which characterized his kind nature.You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made\nit as prosperous as any in the town.I am sorry, sir, that those\ncontemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut\nshort many promising business careers such as yours, sir.And the good gentleman looked\nout of the window.He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War,\nwhen his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr.\"These notes cannot be met,\" he repeated, and his voice was near to\nbreaking.The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound.Outside the\npartition, among the bales, was silence.Hopper, with a remarkable ease, \"I cal'late these\nnotes can be met.\"The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell\nto the floor.Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it.\"There isn't a bank in town\nthat will lend me money.I--I haven't a friend--a friend I may ask who\ncan spare it, sir.\"Suavity was come upon\nit like a new glove and changed the man.Now\nhe had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in\nleather and mahogany offices.\"I will take up those notes myself, sir.\"cried the Colonel, incredulously, \"You?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his\nnature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan.He did not\nbeam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and\nfriendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules.", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and\nunnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of\nthose who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last.When we\nare thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little\nbosoms that may burst into flame and burn us.Not that Colonel Carvel\nhad ever been aught but courteous and kind to all.His station in life\nhad been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation\nthat made him tremble.\"I cal'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes,\nColonel.Here followed an interval\nof sheer astonishment to Mr.\"And you will take my note for the amount?\"The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face\nthe new light in which he saw his manager.He knew well enough that the\nman was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.He reviewed\nhis whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to\nthe shipping room, to his replacement of Mr.Hood, and there was nothing\nwith which to accuse him.He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige\nand Virginia.He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now.He\nwould not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs.Colfax, to let him touch the money\nhe had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had\nleft the girl was sacred.Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those\nEastern debts.Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern\ngentleman.His house would bring nothing\nin these times.He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his\nchin.Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the\nthird time stopped abruptly before him.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.\"Where the devil did you get this money, sir?\"\"I haven't been extravagant, Colonel, since I've worked for you,\"\nhe said.The furrows in the Colonel's brow deepened.\"You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr.Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it.\"Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it.But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of\npaper from a pigeonhole.\"These be some of my investments,\" he answered, with just a tinge of\nsurliness.I ain't forcing you to\ntake the money, sir,\" he flared up, all at once.He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save\nGod knew the shock that his pride received that day.To rescue a name\nwhich had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he\ndrew forth some blank notes, and filled them out.But before he signed\nthem he spoke:\n\n\"You are a business man, Mr.Hopper,\" said he, \"And as a business man\nyou must know that these notes will not legally hold.The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St.\"One moment, sir,\" cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his\nfull height.\"Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or\nyour security, which is this business.I need not tell you, sir, that my\nword is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.\"\"I'm not afraid, Colonel,\" answered Mr.Hopper, with a feeble attempt at\ngeniality.He was, in truth, awed at last.\"If you\nwere--this instant you should leave this place.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.He sat down, and\ncontinued more calmly: \"It will not be long before a Southern Army\nmarches into St.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.\"Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then,\nMr.God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel's simple faith.And if\nEliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here.\"Leave that to me, Colonel,\" he said soberly.The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that\nbusiness which had been an honor to the city where it was founded, I\nthank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk\nthat day.Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those\nnotes, or the time?Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.It was the\nsignal for the little force which remained to leave.Outside, in the\nstore; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out.Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld\nMr.Carvel with his head bowed, down in his hands.\"Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago,\nbefo'--befo' she done left us?\"He saw the faithful old <DW64> but dimly.Faintly he heard the pleading\nvoice.\"Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n\nLige?\"\"Ephum,\" said the Colonel, sadly, \"I had a letter from the Captain\nyesterday.His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in\nYankee pay.\"Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, \"But de Cap'n's yo' friend,\nMarse Comyn.He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn.He ain't in de army, suh.\"\"And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum,\" answered the Colonel, quietly.\"But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government.No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments.\"Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that\nnight.Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many\nhalts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the\ncity.At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the\nentrances of the sale stables there.Whips are cracking like pistol\nshots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States\nArmy are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and\nfingering the frightened animals.A herd breaks from the confusion\nand is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market\nHouse.They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the\nbattlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.Hopper alights from the car with complacency.He stands for a\nwhile on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene,\nunnoticed.Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into\nMr.Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out\nof one of the offices, and perceives our friend.Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned.\"Wal, I jest reckon,\" is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the\nappearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of\ngenteel importance.He could not have been more than two and twenty, and\nhis face and manners were those of a clerk.The tan of field service was\nlacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes.\"Hullo, Ford,\" he said, jocularly.\"Howdy, Cap,\" retorted the other.\"Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry,\nfo' sure.Gov'ment\nain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon.\"Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face\nthat the Captain smiled.And at the same time he glanced down nervously\nat the new line of buttons on his chest.\"I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time,\" said he.\"Wal, I jest reckon,\" asserted Mr.\"Cap'n\nWentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr.\"I don't cal'late to be,\" said.Let us hope that our worthy\nhas not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor.He\ngrinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added,\n\"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess.Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?\"\"It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all\nday in the sun.\"Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen,\nthat the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down\ntown.Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School,\nit is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by\nMr.Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear.And Eliphalet understands that\nthe good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart\npeople a chance to practise their talents.Hopper neither drinks nor\nsmokes, but he uses the

and from various causes, which will be pointed out\nhereafter, the idea was abandoned, and the architects were forced to\ncontent themselves with a stone ceiling, covered by a wooden roof,\nthough this became one of the radical defects of the style, and one of\nthe principal causes of the decay and destruction of so many beautiful\nbuildings.Section of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.(From\nIsabelle, \u2018\u00c9difices Circulaires.\u2019) No scale.]<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Ravenna possesses several circular buildings, almost as interesting as\nthose of the capital; the first being the baptistery of St.John\nbelonging to the original basilica, and consequently one of the oldest\nChristian buildings of the place.Externally it is a plain octagonal\nbuilding, 40 ft.Internally it still retains its mosaic and\nother internal features added in the 5th century, which are singularly\nelegant and pleasing.Its design is somewhat like that of the temple at\nSpalato, but with arcades substituted everywhere for horizontal\narchitraves; the century that elapsed between these two epochs having\nsufficed to complete the transition between the two styles.Far more interesting than this is the great church of St.Vitale, the\nmost complicated, and at the same time, perhaps, the most beautiful, of\nthe circular churches of that age.In design it is nearly identical with\nthe church of St.Sergius at Constantinople (see Woodcut No.311), from\nwhich it was undoubtedly copied, and probably by Greek artists from that\ntown.It was built in the reign of Justinian by St.Ecclesius,\narchbishop of the see, and was consecrated in 547, eight years after the\ntaking of Ravenna by Justinian\u2019s generals.The principal difference of\nthe plan lies in its being enclosed within an octagon instead of a\nsquare, as in St.Sergius, probably to mask the irregularity of the main\nentrance from a street which did not run in the direction of any of the\ncardinal points.The recesses are loftier in proportion than those of\nSt.Sergius, and in the lower storey arcades take the place of beams.The aisles being covered with timber roofs, it was necessary to raise\nthe walls of the octagon higher than those of St.Sergius, and small\narches take the place of the usual pendentives: the springing of the\ndome, which is 50 ft.in diameter, is on the level of the sill of the\nwindows the arches of which therefore form penetrations into the dome.The church is built in bricks with thick mortar joints, the dome being\nconstructed in an ingenious manner with hollow pots fitted the end of\none into the mouth of the other; the lightness of this vault has enabled\nthe builders to dispense with the", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John went to the garden.Similar construction with pots had been\nemployed in the East for domes and roofs,[291] and they form as\npermanent a method as stone itself, in addition to the stability,\nfacility of construction, and lightness which such an expedient affords.Internally a good deal has been done in modern times to destroy the\nsimplicity of the original effect of the building; but still there is a\npleasing result produced by alternating the piers with circular columns,\nand a lightness and elegance about the whole design that render it\nunrivalled in the western world among churches of its class.This seems\nto have been admitted by its contemporaries as much as it is in modern\ntimes.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.Charlemagne at all events copied it for his own tomb at\nAix-la-Chapelle, and the architects of many other circular buildings of\nthat age appear to have derived their inspiration from this one.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the football.The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, had it not been so much altered in\nmodern times, would take precedence of San Vitale in almost every\nrespect.The date of its erection is not known, though it certainly must\nbe as early as, if not earlier than, the time of Justinian.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.Down to the\n8th century it was the cathedral of the city.It was burnt to the ground\nin 1071, and restored in 1119; the dome then erected fell in 1571, on\nwhich it underwent its last transformation from the hands of Martino\nBassi and Pellegrini, who so disfigured its ancient details as to lead\nmany modern inquirers to doubt whether it was really so old as it was\nsaid to be.Its plan, however, seems to have remained unchanged, and shows a further\nprogress towards what afterwards became the Byzantine style than is to\nbe found either in St.It is in fact the\nearliest attempt to amalgamate the circular church with one of a square\nshape; and except that the four lateral colonnades are flat segments of\ncircles, and that there is a little clumsiness in the angles (due\npossibly to the additions made in 1119 and 1571, when the plan of the\ndome was changed to an octagon, the original dome being probably\ncircular, and carried on four spherical pendentives), it is one of the\nmost successful designs handed down from that early age.The dome as it now stands is octagonal, which the first dome certainly\ncould not have been.Its diameter is 70 ft., nearly equal to that of the\nMinerva Medica, and the whole diameter of the building is internally 142\nft.(From Quast,\n\u2018Altchristlichen,\u2019 &c.)In front of the church, in the street, is a handsome colonnade of\npillars, borrowed from some ancient temple\u2014it is said from one dedicated\nto Hercules; this leads to a square atrium, now wholly deprived of its\nlateral arcades; and this again to a fa\u00e7ade, which has been strangely\naltered in modern times.Opposite this, to the eastward of the church,\nis an octagonal building, apparently intended as a tomb-house; and on\nthe north side a similar one, though smaller.On the south is the\nbaptistery, about 45 ft.in diameter, approached by a vestibule in the\nsame manner as that of Constantine at Rome, and as in the tomb of his\ndaughter Constantia: all these, however, have been so painfully altered,\nthat little remains besides the bare plan of the building; still there\nis enough to show that this is one of the oldest and most interesting of\nthe Christian churches of Italy.The building now known as the baptistery at Florence is an octagon, 108\nft.Like the last-mentioned church, it was\noriginally the cathedral of the city, and was erected to serve as such\napparently in the time of Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards.<|begin_of_text|>John left the football there.If this\nwas so, it certainly had not originally its present form, and most\nprobably those columns which now stand ranged round the walls at that\ntime stood in the centre, as in the Roman examples.If the original roof\nwas of wood, it was probably in two storeys, like that of the baptistery\nof Constantine, or it may have been a dome of more solid materials, like\nthat of the Sta.At the same time when the new cathedral was built, the older edifice\nappears to have been remodelled both internally and externally by\nArnolpho da Lapo, and both its form and decoration so completely\nchanged, that it must now be considered rather as a building of the 13th\ncentury than of the 6th, in which it seems originally to have been\nerected.[292]\n\n[Illustration: 433.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Baptistery at\nNovara.The baptistery of Novara, which may date from the time of Charlemagne,\nis interesting in that it contains the germ of those external galleries\nunder the roof which form not only one of the most common but also one\nof the most beautiful features of the later Lombard and Rhenish\nchurches.433) it will easily be seen\nwhat was the motive and use of this arrangement, the first trace of\nwhich dates perhaps as far back as the baptistery of Nocera (Woodcut No.428); for wherever a wooden roof was placed over a circular vault, it is\nevident that the external walls must be carried up higher than the\nspringing of the arch.But it was by no means necessary that this\nadditional wall should be so solid as that below it, and it was\nnecessary to introduce light and air into the space between the stone\nand the wooden roofs.Add to this the incongruity of effect in placing a\nlight tiled wooden roof on a massive solid wall, and it will be evident\nthat not only did the exigencies of the building, but the true\nprinciples of taste, demand that this part should be made as light as\npossible.Such openings as those found in the baptistery at Novara\nsuggested an expedient which provided for these objects.This was\nafterwards carried to a much greater extent.At first, however, it seems\nonly to have been used under the roofs of the domes with which the\nItalians almost universally crowned the intervention of naves and\ntransepts, and round the semidomes of the apses; but so enamoured did\nthey afterwards become of this feature, that it is frequently carried\nalong the sides of the churches under the roof of the nave and of the\naisles, and also\u2014where it is of more questionable taste\u2014under the\nsloping naves of the roof of the principal fa\u00e7ade.There is nothing in the Lombardian and Rhenish styles so common or so\nbeautiful as these galleries, the arcades of which have all the shadow\ngiven by a cornice without its inconvenient projection, while the little\nshafts with their elegant capitals and light archivolts have a sparkle\nand brilliancy which no cornice ever possessed.Indeed so beautiful are\nthey, that we are not surprised to find them universally adopted; and\ntheir discontinuance on the introduction of the pointed style was one of\nthe greatest losses sustained by architectural art in those days.It is\ntrue they would have been quite incompatible with the thin walls and\nlight piers of pointed architecture, but it may be safely asserted that\nno feature which these new styles introduced was equally beautiful with\nthose galleries which they superseded.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.There can be little doubt that many other similar buildings belonging to\nthis age still exist in various parts of Italy; for it is more than\nprobable that, at a time when the city was not of sufficient importance,\nor the congregation so numerous as to require the more extended\naccommodation of the basilica, almost all the earlier churches were\ncircular.They either, however, have perished from lapse of time, or\nhave been so altered as to be nearly unrecognisable.We here, in\nconsequence, come again to a break in the chain of our sequence; and\nwhen we again meet with any circular buildings in Italy, their features\nare so distinctly Gothic or Byzantine, that they must be classed with\none or other of these modifications.The true Romano-Byzantine style had\nnearly come to an end when Alboin the Lombard had made himself master of\nthe greater part of Italy about the year 575.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.Before leaving this branch of the subject there are two small buildings\nat Ravenna which it is impossible to pass over, though their direct\nbearing on the history of this subject is not so apparent as it is in\nthe case of other buildings just described.The first and earliest is\nthe tomb of Galla Placidia (Woodcut No.302), now known as the church of\nSS.Nazario and Celso, and must have been erected before the year 450.It is singular among all the tombs of that age from the abandonment in\nit of the circular for a cruciform plan.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the football there.Such forms, it is true, are\ncommon in the chambers of tumuli and also among the catacombs, while the\nchurch which Constantine built in Constantinople and dedicated to the\nApostles, meaning it however as a sepulchral church, was something also\non this plan.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.Notwithstanding, however, these examples, this must be\nconsidered as an exceptional form, though its diminutiveness (it being\nonly 35 ft.by 30 internally) might perhaps account for any caprice.Its\ngreat interest to us consists in its retaining not only its primitive\narchitectural form (which is that of a dome carried on pendentives, and\none of the few instances in which both dome and pendentives form part of\none sphere), but its polychromatic decorations nearly in their original\nstate of completeness (Woodcut 302).The three arms of the cross forming\nthe receptacles for the three sarcophagi is certainly a pleasing\narrangement, but is only practicable on a small scale.Capital of Pillars forming peristyle round\nTheodoric\u2019s Tomb.Elevation of Tomb of Theodoric, Ravenna.(From\nIsabelle, \u2018\u00c9difices Circulaires.\u2019)]\n\nFar more interesting than this\u2014architecturally at least\u2014is the tomb of\nTheodoric, the Gothic king, now known as Santa Maria Rotunda.The lower\nstorey is a decagon externally, enclosing a cruciform crypt.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.in diameter, each face being ornamented by a deep niche.These\nsupport a flat terrace, on which originally stood a range of small\npillars supporting arches which surrounded the upper storey.These have\nall been removed, though their form can be restored from fragments\nfound, and as shown in Woodcut No.On the face of the tomb itself\nare the sinkings for the architraves and vaults which they supported.The most singular part of the building is the roof, which is formed of\none great slab hollowed out into the form of a flat dome\u2014internally 30\nft.in diameter\u2014and which certainly forms one of\nthe most unique and appropriate coverings for a tomb perhaps anywhere to\nbe found.Near the edge are a series of projecting bosses, which\nevidently were originally used as handles, by means of which the immense\nmass was raised to its present position.In the centre of the dome is a\nsmall square pedestal, on which, it is said, once stood the urn which\ncontained the ashes of its founder.The model of this building seems probably to have been the Mole of\nHadrian, which Theodoric saw, and must have admired, during his\ncelebrated visit to Rome.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.The polygonal arrangements of the exterior,\nand the substitution of arcades for horizontal architraves, were only\nsuch changes as the lapse of time had rendered indispensable.But the\nbuilding of the ancient world which it most resembles is the Tour Magne\nat N\u00eemes.In both cases we have the polygonal basement containing a\ngreat chamber, and above this externally the narrow ledge, approached by\nflying flights of steps.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.We cannot now tell what crowned the French\nexample, though the fact of an urn crowning the tomb at Ravenna points\nto an identical origin, but we must obtain a greater number of examples\nbefore we can draw any positive conclusions as to the origin of such\nforms.Meanwhile, however, whether we consider the appropriateness of\nthe forms, the solidity of its construction, or the simplicity of its\nornaments and details, this tomb at Ravenna is not surpassed by any\nbuilding of its class and age.Though the investigation of the early history of these circular forms of\nchurches is not so important as that of the rectangular basilicas, it is\nextremely interesting from the influence they had on the subsequent\ndevelopment of the style.In Italy it is probable that one-half of the\nearly churches were circular in plan; and one such is still generally\nretained attached to each cathedral as a baptistery.Except for this\npurpose, however, the form has generally been superseded: the\nrectangular being much easier to construct, more capable of extension,\nand altogether more appropriate to the ritual of the Christian\ncommunity.In France the circular form was early absorbed into the\nbasilica, forming the Chevet or apse.In Germany its fate was much the\nsame as in Italy, but its supersession was earlier and more complete.In\nEngland some half-dozen examples are known to exist, and in Spain they\nhave yet to be discovered.Had the Gothic architects applied themselves to the extension and\nelaboration of the circular form with the same zeal and skill as was\ndisplayed in that task by their Byzantine brethren, they might probably\nhave produced something far more beautiful than even the best of our\nmedi\u00e6val cathedrals; but when the Barbarians began to build, they found\nthe square form with its straight lines simpler and easier to construct.It thus happened that, long before they became as civilised and expert\nas the Easterns were when they commenced the task, the Westerns had\nworked the rectangular form into one of considerable beauty, and had\nadapted it to their ritual, and their ritual to it.It thus became the\nsacred and appropriate form, and the circular or domical forms were\nconsequently never allowed a fair trial in Western Europe.Very few remains of secular buildings in the early Christian style are\nnow to be found in Italy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.The palace of Theodoric at Ravenna, though\nsadly mutilated, is perhaps the best and most perfect.In all its\ndetails it shows a close resemblance to that of Diocletian at Spalato,\nbut more especially so to the Porta Aurea and the most richly and least\nclassically decorated parts of that edifice, but much intermixed with\nmouldings and details which would seem to belong to a later style.Another building, though perhaps of earlier date, is that which is now\ncalled the Palazzo delle Torre at Turin, and which still retains the\narchitectural ordinance of the exterior of a Roman amphitheatre, but so\nmodified by common sense that the pilasters are frankly accepted as\npurely decorative features, having only a slight projection.A similar\nstyle of work is found at Bordeaux in what is known as the \u201cPalais\nGallien,\u201d but which in reality is a fragment of an amphitheatre built by\nthe Emperor Gallienus (260-268 A.D.).The example at Turin is built with\nbrick of large dimensions 15 in.by 11 in., which, coupled with its\ncharacter and style, has led M. Cattaneo to ascribe it to the 3rd or 4th\ncentury of our era; the paucity of contemporary examples, however,\nrenders it extremely difficult to trace the exact history of the style\nat this age.(From Osten\u2019s \u2018Bauwerke\nin der Lombardei.\u2019)]\n\nIn so progressive an art as architecture it is always very difficult,\nsometimes impossible, to fix the exact date when one style ends and\nanother begins.In an art so pre-eminently ecclesiastical as\narchitecture was in those days, it will probably be safer to look in the\nannals of the Church rather than in those of the State for a date when\nthe debased-Roman expired, giving birth, ph\u0153nix-like, to the Romanesque.Viewed from this point there can be little doubt but that the reign of\nGregory the Great (A.D.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.590 to 603) must be regarded as that in which\nthe Latin language and the Roman style of", "question": "Where is the football?

but\nItaly in those days was far more densely peopled than Germany, and the\ninhabitants were consequently able to resist obliteration far more\nsuccessfully than on the north of the Alps, and even where the new\nelement prevailed most strongly its influence was far less felt than in\nthe more sparsely-peopled Rhenish provinces.This was generally more\napparent along the coast than in the interior.Venice did not exist, and\nRavenna, though overwhelmed, became the great centre of Romano-Byzantine\nart.The\nBarbarian influence was strongly felt at Siena, more feebly at Orvieto;\nbut there it was stopped by the influence of Rome, which throughout the\nMiddle Ages remained nearly uncontaminated.Notwithstanding the almost insuperable barrier of the Alps which\nstretched between them and the different influences to which they were\nsubjected, the connection between the northern and southern hordes\nremained intimate during the whole of the Middle Ages.Milan was as much\nGerman as Italian; and, indeed, except from a slightly superior degree\nof elegance in the southern examples, it is sometimes extremely\ndifficult to distinguish between the designs of Lombard and of Rhenish\nchurches.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.As the Middle Ages wore on, however, the breach between the\ntwo styles widened; and there is no difficulty, in the later pointed\nschools, in seeing how Italy was gradually working itself free from\nGerman influence, till at last they became distinct and antagonistic\nnationalities, practising two styles of art, which had very little in\ncommon the one with the other.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.Whoever the Barbarians were who in the 5th and 6th centuries swarmed\ninto Italy\u2014Austro-Goths, Visi-Goths, or Lombards\u2014they certainly did not\nbelong to any of the great building races of the world.Few people ever\nhad better opportunities than they of employing their easily-acquired\nplunder in architectural magnificence, if they had any taste that way;\nbut, though we hear everywhere of the foundation of churches and the\nendowment of ecclesiastical establishments during the Carlovingian\nperiod, not one important edifice of that age has come down to our time.The monumental history of the early Romanesque style is as essentially a\nblank in Italy as it is in Saxon England.One or two circular buildings\nremain tolerably entire; some small chapels let us into the secrets of\nthe style, but not one important edifice of any sort attests the\nsplendour of the Lombard kingdom of Northern Italy.Aryans they must\nhave been, and it was not till the beginning of the 11th century, when\ntheir blood was thoroughly mixed with that of the indigenous inhabitants\nand a complete fusion of races had taken place, that we find buildings\nof a monumental character erected, which have come down to the present\nday.Among the smaller monuments of the age none has been preserved more\ncomplete and less altered than the little chapel at Friuli; which,\nthough extremely small (only 18 ft.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.by 30 inside the walls), is\ninteresting, as retaining all its decorations almost exactly as they\nwere left by Gertrude, duchess of Friuli, who erected it in the 8th\ncentury.It shows considerable elegance in its details, and the\nsculpture is far better than it afterwards became, though perhaps its\nmost remarkable peculiarity is the intersecting vault that covers\nit\u2014_pulchre testudinatum_, as the old chronicle terms it.This is one\nproof among many, how early that feature was introduced which afterwards\nbecame the formative principle of the whole Gothic style, and was as\nessentially its characteristic as the pillars and entablatures of the\nfive orders were the characteristics of the classical styles of Greece\nand Rome.As before remarked, it is this necessity for a stone roof that\nwas the problem to be solved by the architects, and to accomplish which\nthe style took almost all those forms which are so much admired in it.From this example of the Carlovingian era we are obliged to pass to the\n11th and 12th centuries, the first great building age of the Lombards.It is true that there is scarcely a single important church in Pavia, in\nVerona, or indeed in any of the cities of Lombardy, the original\nfoundation of which cannot be traced back to a much earlier period.Before the canons of architectural criticism were properly understood,\nantiquaries were inclined to believe that in the buildings now existing\nthey saw the identical edifices erected during the period of the Lombard\nsway.Either, however, in consequence of the rude construction of the\nearlier buildings, or because they were too small or too poor for the\nincreased population and wealth of the cities at a later period, every\none of the original churches has disappeared and been replaced by a\nlarger and better-constructed edifice, adorned with all the improvements\nwhich the experience of centuries had introduced into the construction\nof religious edifices.Judging from the rudeness of the earliest churches which we know to have\nbeen erected in the 11th century, it is evident that the progress made,\nup to that period, was by no means equal to what was accomplished during\nthe next two centuries.[294]]\n\nThis will appear from the plan and section of St.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.Antonio at Piacenza\n(Woodcuts Nos.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.440 and 440a), built in the first years of the 11th\ncentury, and dedicated in 1014 by Bishop Siegfried.Section of Church of San Antonio at Piacenza.Plan and section of Baptistry at Asti.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the milk.Its arrangement is somewhat peculiar; the transepts are near the west\nend, and the octagonal tower rising from the intersection is supported\non eight pillars, the square being completed by four polygonal piers.The principal point, however, to observe is, how completely the style\nhas emancipated itself from all Roman tradition.A new style has grown\nup as essentially different from the early Christian as the style of\nCologne or of York Cathedral.The architect is once more at liberty to\nwork out his own designs without reference to anything beyond the\nexigencies of the edifices themselves.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.The plan, indeed, is still a\nreminiscence of the Basilica; but so are all the plans of Medi\u00e6val\ncathedrals, and we may trace back the forms of the pillars, the piers,\nand the arches they support, to the preceding style.All these were\nderived from Roman art, but the originals are forgotten, and the new\nstyle is wholly independent of the old one.The whole of the church too\nis roofed with intersecting vaults, which have become an integral part\nof the design, giving it an essentially different character.On the\noutside buttresses are introduced\u2014timidly, it is true, but so\nfrequently, as to make it evident that already there existed no\ninsuperable objection to increase either their number or depth, as soon\nas additional abutment was required for wider arches.The windows, as in all Italian churches, are small, for the Italians\nnever patronised the art of painting on glass, always preferring\nfrescoes or paintings on opaque grounds.In their bright climate, very\nsmall openings alone were requisite to admit a sufficiency of light\nwithout disturbing that shadowy effect which is so favourable to\narchitectural grandeur.Being a parochial church, this building had no baptistery attached to\nit; but there is one at Asti (Woodcut No.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.441) so similar in style and\nage, that its plan and section, if examined with those of San Antonio,\nwill give a very complete idea of Lombard architecture in the beginning\nof the 11th century, when it had completely shaken off the Roman\ninfluence, but had not yet begun to combine the newly-invented forms\nwith that grace and beauty which mark its more finished examples.One\npeculiarity of this building is the gloom that reigns within, there\nbeing absolutely no windows in the dome, and those in the aisles are so\nsmall, that even in Italy the interior must always have been in\ncomparative darkness.The cathedral of Novara, which in its present state is one of the most\nimportant buildings of the 11th century in the North of Italy, shows the\nstyle still further advanced.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple there.The coupling and grouping of piers are\nhere fully understood, and the divisions of the chapels which form the\nouter aisle are, in fact, concealed buttresses.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.The Italians were never\nable to divest themselves of their partiality for flat walls, and never\nliked the bold external projections so universally admired on the other\nside of the Alps.They therefore gladly had recourse to this expedient\nto conceal them; and when this was not available they used metallic ties\nto resist the thrust of the arches\u2014an expedient which is found even in\nthis example.As will be seen from the annexed plan, the atrium\nconnecting the basilica with the baptistery is retained, which seems to\nhave been an arrangement almost universal in those early times.The half\nsection, half elevation of the front (Woodcut No.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.443) shows very\ndistinctly how far the invention of the new style had then gone; for\nexcept some Corinthian pillars, borrowed from an older edifice, no trace\nof debased-Roman architecture is to be found in it.The design of the\nfa\u00e7ade explains what it was that suggested to the Pisan architects the\nform to which they adapted their Romanesque details.In both styles the\narcade was the original model of the whole system of ornamentation.In\nthis case it is used first as a discharging arch, then as a mere\nrepetition of a useful member, and lastly without pillars, as a mere\nornamental string-course, which afterwards became the most favourite\nornament, not only in Italy, but throughout all Germany.Elevation and Section of the Fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral\nat Novara.Interesting as such an example is to the architectural antiquary who is\ntracing back and trying to understand the forms of a new style, it would\nbe difficult to conceive anything much uglier and less artistic than\nsuch a fa\u00e7ade as this of Novara or that of San Antonio, last quoted.Their sole merit is their history and their expression of rude energy,\nso characteristic of the people who erected them.The church of San Michele at Pavia, which took its present form either\nat the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century, is one of the\nmost interesting of this age, and presents in itself all the\ncharacteristics of a perfect round-arched Gothic church.Indeed there is\nhardly any feature worth mentioning which was invented after this date\nexcept the pointed arch\u2014a very doubtful improvement\u2014and window tracery,\nwhich the Italians never cordially adopted or understood.444) shows the general arrangement of San Michele in its\npresent state.The researches of M. de Dartein,[295] however, have shown\nthat, when first built, the nave was covered over with two square\nquadripartite vaults, as might in fact have been divined from the\ndifference in size[296] of the centre and two other piers.The existing\noblong vaulted compartments date from the 15th century, when secondary\nshafts were carried up above the ground storey shafts of piers 1 and 3.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.The section, however, shows that well-marked vaulting shafts spring from\nfloor to roof, that the pier arches in the wall are probably distinct\nand well understood, and that the angles of these piers are softened and\nornamented by shafts and other subordinate members.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the apple there.Altogether, it is\nevident that that subdivision of labour (if the expression may be used)\nwhich was so characteristic of the true Gothic style had here been\nperfectly understood, every part having its own function and telling its\nown story.With all this knowledge, which no one knew more to prize, with boundless\nwealth, and with an athletic frame, which sickness had never tried, and\nwhich had avoided excess, Sidonia nevertheless looked upon life with\na glance rather of curiosity than content.His religion walled him\nout from the pursuits of a citizen; his riches deprived him of the\nstimulating anxieties of a man.He perceived himself a lone being, alike\nwithout cares and without duties.To a man in his position there might yet seem one unfailing source\nof felicity and joy; independent of creed, independent of country,\nindependent even of character.He might have discovered that perpetual\nspring of happiness in the sensibility of the heart.But this was a\nsealed fountain to Sidonia.In his organisation there was a peculiarity,\nperhaps a great deficiency.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.It would be\nharsh to say he had no heart, for he was susceptible of deep emotions,\nbut not for individuals.He was capable of rebuilding a town that was\nburned down; of restoring a colony that had been destroyed by some awful\nvisitation of Nature; of redeeming to liberty a horde of captives; and\nof doing these great acts in secret; for, void of all self-love, public\napprobation was worthless to him; but the individual never touched him.Woman was to him a toy, man a machine.The lot the most precious to man, and which a beneficent Providence\nhas made not the least common; to find in another heart a perfect and\nprofound sympathy; to unite his existence with one who could share all\nhis joys, soften all his sorrows, aid him in all his projects, respond\nto all his fancies, counsel him in his cares, and support him in\nhis perils; make life charming by her charms, interesting by her\nintelligence, and sweet by the vigilant variety of her tenderness;\nto find your life blessed by such an influence, and to feel that your\ninfluence can bless such a life: this lot, the most divine of divine\ngifts, that power and even fame can never rival in its delights, all\nthis Nature had denied to Sidonia.With an imagination as fiery as his native Desert, and an intellect as\nluminous as his native sky, he wanted, like that land, those softening\ndews without which the soil is barren, and the sunbeam as often a\nmessenger of pestilence as an angel of regenerative grace.Such a temperament, though rare, is peculiar to the East.It inspired\nthe founders of the great monarchies of antiquity, the prophets that the\nDesert has sent forth, the Tartar chiefs who have overrun the world;\nit might be observed in the great Corsican, who, like most of the\ninhabitants of the Mediterranean isles, had probably Arab blood in his\nveins.It is a temperament that befits conquerors and legislators, but,\nin ordinary times and ordinary situations, entails on its possessor only\neccentric aberrations or profound melancholy.The only human quality that interested Sidonia was Intellect.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.He", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "The author,\nthe artist, the man of science, never appealed to him in vain.He encouraged their society; was as\nfrank in his conversation as he was generous in his contributions; but\nthe instant they ceased to be authors, artists, or philosophers, and\ntheir communications arose from anything but the intellectual quality\nwhich had originally interested him, the moment they were rash enough\nto approach intimacy and appealed to the sympathising man instead of\nthe congenial intelligence, he saw them no more.It was not however\nintellect merely in these unquestionable shapes that commanded his\nnotice.There was not an adventurer in Europe with whom he was not\nfamiliar.No Minister of State had such communication with secret agents\nand political spies as Sidonia.He held relations with all the clever\noutcasts of the world.The catalogue of his acquaintance in the shape of\nGreeks, Armenians, Moors, secret Jews, Tartars, Gipsies, wandering\nPoles and Carbonari, would throw a curious light on those subterranean\nagencies of which the world in general knows so little, but which\nexercise so great an influence on public events.His extensive travels,\nhis knowledge of languages, his daring and adventurous disposition, and\nhis unlimited means, had given him opportunities of becoming acquainted\nwith these characters, in general so difficult to trace, and of gaining\ntheir devotion.To these sources he owed that knowledge of strange and\nhidden things which often startled those who listened to him.Nor was it\neasy, scarcely possible, to deceive him.Information reached him from\nso many, and such contrary quarters, that with his discrimination and\nexperience, he could almost instantly distinguish the truth.The secret\nhistory of the world was his pastime.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.His great pleasure was to contrast\nthe hidden motive, with the public pretext, of transactions.One source of interest Sidonia found in his descent and in the\nfortunes of his race.As firm in his adherence to the code of the great\nLegislator as if the trumpet still sounded on Sinai, he might have\nreceived in the conviction of divine favour an adequate compensation\nfor human persecution.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.But there were other and more terrestrial\nconsiderations that made Sidonia proud of his origin, and confident\nin the future of his kind.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.Sidonia was a great philosopher, who took\ncomprehensive views of human affairs, and surveyed every fact in its\nrelative position to other facts, the only mode of obtaining truth.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Sidonia was well aware that in the five great varieties into which\nPhysiology has divided the human species; to wit, the Caucasian, the\nMongolian, the Malayan, the American, the Ethiopian; the Arabian tribes\nrank in the first and superior class, together, among others, with the\nSaxon and the Greek.This fact alone is a source of great pride and\nsatisfaction to the animal Man.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.But Sidonia and his brethren could\nclaim a distinction which the Saxon and the Greek, and the rest of\nthe Caucasian nations, have forfeited.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Doubtless, among the tribes who inhabit the bosom of the Desert,\nprogenitors alike of the Mosaic and the Mohammedan Arabs, blood may be\nfound as pure as that of the descendants of the Scheik Abraham.But the\nMosaic Arabs are the most ancient, if not the only, unmixed blood that\ndwells in cities.An unmixed race of a firstrate organisation are the aristocracy of\nNature.Such excellence is a positive fact; not an imagination, a\nceremony, coined by poets, blazoned by cozening heralds, but perceptible\nin its physical advantages, and in the vigour of its unsullied\nidiosyncrasy.In his comprehensive travels, Sidonia had visited and examined the\nHebrew communities of the world.He had found, in general, the lower\norders debased; the superior immersed in sordid pursuits; but he\nperceived that the intellectual development was not impaired.He was persuaded that organisation would outlive persecution.When he reflected on what they had endured, it was only marvellous\nthat the race had not disappeared.They had defied exile, massacre,\nspoliation, the degrading influence of the constant pursuit of gain;\nthey had defied Time.For nearly three thousand years, according to\nArchbishop Usher, they have been dispersed over the globe.To the\nunpolluted current of their Caucasian structure, and to the segregating\ngenius of their great Law-giver, Sidonia ascribed the fact that they\nhad not been long ago absorbed among those mixed races, who presume\nto persecute them, but who periodically wear away and disappear, while\ntheir victims still flourish in all the primeval vigour of the pure\nAsian breed.Shortly after his arrival in England, Sidonia repaired to the principal\nCourts of Europe, that he might become personally acquainted with\nthe monarchs and ministers of whom he had heard so much.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.His position\ninsured him a distinguished reception; his personal qualities\nimmediately made him cherished.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the office.He could please; he could do more, he\ncould astonish.He could throw out a careless observation which would\nmake the oldest diplomatist start;

and it may be\nfairly said of Sidonia that few men were more popular, and none less\nunderstood.At dinner, Coningsby was seated on the same side as Sidonia, and distant\nfrom him.There had been, therefore, no mutual recognition.He came straight from London,\nfull of rumours, had seen Tadpole, who, hearing he was on the wing for\nConingsby Castle, had taken him into a dark corner of a club, and\nshown him his book, a safe piece of confidence, as Mr.Ormsby was very\nnear-sighted.It was, however, to be received as an undoubted fact, that\nall was right, and somehow or other, before very long, there would be\nnational demonstration of the same.Ormsby, and the\nnews that he bore, gave a political turn to the conversation after the\nladies had left the room.'Tadpole wants me to stand for Birmingham,' said Mr.exclaimed Lord Monmouth, and throwing himself back in his chair,\nhe broke into a real, hearty laugh.'Yes; the Conservatives mean to start two candidates; a manufacturer\nthey have got, and they have written up to Tadpole for a \"West-end\nman.\"''A West-end man, who will make the ladies patronise their fancy\narticles.''The result of the Reform Bill, then,' said Lucian Gay, 'will be to give\nManchester a bishop, and Birmingham a dandy.''I begin to believe the result will be very different from what we\nexpected,' said Lord Monmouth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Rigby shook his head and was going to prophesy, when Lord Eskdale,\nwho liked talk to be short, and was of opinion that Rigby should keep\nhis amplifications for his slashing articles, put in a brief careless\nobservation, which balked his inspiration.Ormsby, 'when the guns were firing over Vyvyan's\nlast speech and confession, I never expected to be asked to stand for\nBirmingham.'<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the football there.'Perhaps you may be called up to the other house by the title,' said\nLucian Gay.'I agree with Tadpole,' said Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the hallway.Ormsby, 'that if we only stick to the\nRegistration the country is saved.'<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.said Sidonia, 'that can be saved by a good\nregistration!'<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football.'I believe, after all, that with property and pluck,' said Lord\nMonmouth, 'Parliamentary Reform is not such a very bad thing.'Here several gentlemen began talking at the same time, all agreeing\nwith their host, and proving in their different ways, the irresistible\ninfluence of property and pluck; property in Lord Monmouth's mind\nmeaning vassals, and pluck a total disregard for public opinion.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.Guy\nFlouncey, who wanted to get into parliament, but why nobody knew, who\nhad neither political abilities nor political opinions, but had some\nfloating idea that it would get himself and his wife to some more\nballs and dinners, and who was duly ticketed for 'a good thing' in the\ncandidate list of the Tadpoles and the Tapers, was of opinion that an\nimmense deal might be done by properly patronising borough races.That\nwas his specific how to prevent revolution.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.Taking advantage of a pause, Lord Monmouth said, 'I should like to know\nwhat you think of this question, Sidonia?''I am scarcely a competent judge,' he said, as if wishing to disclaim\nany interference in the conversation, and then added, 'but I have been\never of opinion that revolutions are not to be evaded.'Rigby, eagerly; 'I say it now, I have said\nit a thousand times, you may doctor the registration as you like, but\nyou can never get rid of Schedule A.''Is there a person in this room who can now tell us the names of the\nboroughs in Schedule A?'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.'I am sure I cannot,'said Lord Monmouth, 'though six of them belong to\nmyself.'Rigby; 'they represented a principle.''Nothing else, certainly,' said Lucian Gay.'That is a practice, not a principle,' said Sidonia.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.'Is it a practice\nthat no longer exists?''You think then,' said Lord Eskdale, cutting in before Rigby, 'that the\nReform Bill has done us no harm?''It is not the Reform Bill that has shaken the aristocracy of this\ncountry, but the means by which that Bill was carried,' replied Sidonia.Rigby, impatient at any one giving the tone in a\npolitical discussion but himself, and chafing under the vigilance of\nLord Eskdale, which to him ever appeared only fortuitous, violently\nassaulted the argument, and astonished several country gentlemen present\nby its volubility.At the\nend of a long appeal to Sidonia, that gentleman only bowed his head and\nsaid, 'Perhaps;' and then, turning to his neighbour, inquired whether\nbirds were plentiful in Lancashire this season; so that Mr.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.Rigby was\nreduced to the necessity of forming the political opinions of Mr.As the gentlemen left the dining-room, Coningsby, though at some\ndistance, was observed by Sidonia, who stopped instantly, then advanced\nto Coningsby, and extending his hand said, 'I said we should meet again,\nthough I hardly expected so quickly.''And I hope we shall not separate so soon,' said Coningsby; 'I was much\nstruck with what you said just now about the Reform Bill.Do you know\nthat the more I think the more I am perplexed by what is meant by\nRepresentation?''It is a principle of which a limited definition is only current in\nthis country,' said Sidonia, quitting the room with him.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.'People may be\nrepresented without periodical elections of neighbours who are incapable\nto maintain their interests, and strangers who are unwilling.'The entrance of the gentlemen produced the same effect on the saloon as\nsunrise on the world; universal animation, a general though gentle stir.The Grand-duke, bowing to every one, devoted himself to the daughter\nof Lady St.Julians, who herself pinned Lord Beaumanoir before he could\nreach Mrs.Coningsby instead talked nonsense to that lady.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Melton, addressed a band of beautiful\ndamsels grouped on a large ottoman.Everywhere sounded a delicious\nmurmur, broken occasionally by a silver-sounding laugh not too loud.Sidonia and Lord Eskdale did not join the ladies.They stood for a few\nmoments in conversation, and then threw themselves on a sofa.asked Sidonia of his companion rather earnestly, as\nConingsby quitted them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.''Tis the grandson of Monmouth; young Coningsby.'<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.I met him once before, by chance;\nhe interests me.''They tell me he is a lively lad.He is a prodigious favourite here, and\nI should not be surprised if Monmouth made him his heir.''I hope he does not dream of inheritance,' said Sidonia.''Tis the most\nenervating of visions.'Guy Flouncey to\nConingsby.'When should men be gallant, if not to the brilliant and the beautiful!'Coningsby, Lord Henry Sydney is a\nvery great friend of yours?''He does a great deal for the poor at Beaumanoir.A very fine place, is\nit not?'Guy Flouncey at Coningsby, Beaumanoir would have\nno chance.'Coningsby, what do you\nthink we shall do to-night?I look upon you, you know, as the real\narbiter of our destinies.''You shall decide,' said Coningsby.'Mon cher Harry,' said Madame Colonna, coming up, 'they wish Lucretia to\nsing and she will not.You must ask her, she cannot refuse you.''I assure you she can,' said Coningsby.'Mon cher Harry, your grandpapa did desire me to beg you to ask her to\nsing.'So Coningsby unwillingly approached Lucretia, who was talking with the\nRussian Ambassador.'I am sent upon a fruitless mission,' said Coningsby, looking at her,\nand catching her glance.'The mission is to entreat you to do us all a great favour; and the\ncause of its failure will be that I am the envoy.''If the favour be one to yourself, it is granted; and if you be the\nenvoy, you need never fear failure with me.''I must presume then to lead you away,' said Coningsby, bending to the\nAmbassador.'Remember,' said Lucretia, as they approached the instrument, 'that I am\nsinging to you.''It is impossible ever to forget it,' said Coningsby, leading her to the\npiano with great politeness, but only with great politeness.'Where is Mademoiselle Flora?'Coningsby found La Petite crouching as it were behind some furniture,\nand apparently looking over some music.She looked up as he approached,\nand a smile stole over her countenance.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.'I am come to ask a favour,' he\nsaid, and he named his request.'I will sing,' she replied; 'but only tell me what you like.'Coningsby felt the difference between the courtesy of the head and of\nthe heart, as he contrasted the manner of Lucretia and Flora.Nothing\ncould be more exquisitely gracious than the daughter of Colonna was\nto-night; Flora, on the contrary, was rather agitated and embarrassed;\nand did not express her readiness with half the facility and the grace\nof Lucretia; but Flora's arm trembled as Coningsby led her to the piano.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk there.Meantime Lord Eskdale and Sidonia are in deep converse.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the apple.Some new _protegee_ of Lord Monmouth?'''Tis the daughter of the Colonnas,' said Lord Eskdale, 'the Princess\nLucretia.''Why, she was not at dinner to-day.'<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.'My favourite voice;

but when it is bad, for my part I feel myself--'\n\n'Where?''In the last circle of the Inferno,' said Sidonia.'And in what circle do you place us who are here?''One too polished for his verse,' replied her companion.'You mean too insipid,' said the Princess.'I wish that life were a\nlittle more Dantesque.'<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.'There is not less treasure in the world,' said Sidonia, 'because we use\npaper currency; and there is not less passion than of old, though it is\n_bon ton_ to be tranquil.'said the Princess, inquiringly, and then looking\nround the apartment.'Have these automata, indeed, souls?''As many as would have had souls in the\nfourteenth century.''I thought they were wound up every day,' said the Princess.'Some are self-impelling,' said Sidonia.'You are one of\nthose who can read human nature?''Lord Monmouth tells me you are a great traveller?''I would sooner recall the old than discover the new,' said the\nPrincess.'We have both of us cause,' said Sidonia.'Our names are the names of\nthe Past.''I do not love a world of Utility,' said the Princess.'You prefer to be celebrated to being comfortable,' said Sidonia.'It seems to me that the world is withering under routine.'''Tis the inevitable lot of humanity,' said Sidonia.'Man must ever\nbe the slave of routine: but in old days it was a routine of great\nthoughts, and now it is a routine of little ones.'The evening glided on; the dance succeeded the song; the ladies were\nfast vanishing; Coningsby himself was meditating a movement, when Lord\nBeaumanoir, as he passed him, said, 'Come to Lucian Gay's room; we are\ngoing to smoke a cigar.'This was a favourite haunt, towards midnight, of several of the younger\nmembers of the party at the Castle, who loved to find relaxation from\nthe decorous gravities of polished life in the fumes of tobacco, the\ninspiration of whiskey toddy, and the infinite amusement of Lucian Gay's\nconversation and company.This was the genial hour when the good story\ngladdened, the pun flashed, and the song sparkled with jolly mirth\nor saucy mimicry.To-night, being Coningsby's initiation, there was a\nspecial general meeting of the Grumpy Club, in which everybody was to\nsay the gayest things with the gravest face, and every laugh carried a\nforfeit.He told a tale for which\nhe was famous, of 'the very respectable county family who had been\nestablished in the shire for several generations, but who, it was\na fact, had been ever distinguished by the strange and humiliating\npeculiarity of being born with sheep's tails.'The remarkable\ncircumstances under which Lucian Gay had become acquainted with this\nfact; the traditionary mysteries by which the family in question had\nsucceeded for generations in keeping it secret; the decided measures to\nwhich the chief of the family had recourse to stop for ever the rumour\nwhen it first became prevalent; and finally the origin and result of the\nlegend; were details which Lucian Gay, with the most rueful countenance,\nloved to expend upon the attentive and expanding intelligence of a new\nmember of the Grumpy Club.Familiar as all present were with the story\nwhose stimulus of agonising risibility they had all in turn experienced,\nit was with extreme difficulty that any of them could resist the fatal\nexplosion which was to be attended with the dreaded penalty.Lord\nBeaumanoir looked on the table with desperate seriousness, an ominous\npucker quivering round his lip; Mr.Melton crammed his handkerchief into\nhis mouth with one hand, while he lighted the wrong end of a cigar with\nthe other; one youth hung over the back of his chair pinching himself\nlike a faquir, while another hid his countenance on the table.'It was at the Hunt dinner,' continued Lucian Gay, in an almost solemn\ntone, 'that an idea for a moment was prevalent, that Sir Mowbray\nCholmondeley Fetherstonehaugh, as the head of the family, had resolved\nto terminate for ever these mysterious aspersions on his race, that had\ncirculated in the county for more than two centuries; I mean that the\nhighly respectable family of the Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaughs had the\nmisfortune to be graced with that appendage to which I have referred.His health being drunk, Sir Mowbray Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaugh\nrose.He was a little unpopular at the moment, from an ugly story about\nkilling foxes, and the guests were not as quiet as orators generally\ndesire, so the Honourable Baronet prayed particular attention to a\nmatter personal to himself.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.Instantly there was a dead silence--' but\nhere Coningsby, who had moved for some time very restlessly on his\nchair, suddenly started up, and struggling for a moment against the\ninward convulsion, but in vain, stamped against the floor, and gave a\nshout.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.Coningsby,' said the president of the Grumpy Club, amid\nan universal, and now permissible roar of laughter.Coningsby could not sing; so he was to favour them as a substitute\nwith a speech or a sentiment.But Lucian Gay always let one off these\npenalties easily, and, indeed, was ever ready to fulfil them for all.Song, speech, or sentiment, he poured them all forth; nor were pastimes\nmore active wanting.He could dance a Tarantella like a Lazzarone, and\nexecute a Cracovienne with all the mincing graces of a ballet heroine.His powers of mimicry, indeed, were great and versatile.But in nothing\nwas he so happy as in a Parliamentary debate.And it was remarkable\nthat, though himself a man who on ordinary occasions was quite incapable\nwithout infinite perplexity of publicly expressing his sense of the\nmerest courtesy of society, he was not only a master of the style of\nevery speaker of distinction in either house, but he seemed in his\nimitative play to appropriate their intellectual as well as their\nphysical peculiarities, and presented you with their mind as well as\ntheir manner.There were several attempts to-night to induce Lucian to\nindulge his guests with a debate, but he seemed to avoid the exertion,\nwhich was great.As the night grew old, however, and every hour he\ngrew more lively, he suddenly broke without further pressure into the\npromised diversion; and Coningsby listened really with admiration to a\ndiscussion, of which the only fault was that it was more parliamentary\nthan the original, 'plus Arabe que l'Arabie.'The Duke was never more curt, nor Sir Robert more specious; he was as\nfiery as Stanley, and as bitter as Graham.Nor did he do their opponents\nless justice.Lord Palmerston himself never treated a profound subject\nwith a more pleasant volatility; and when Lucian rose at an early hour\nof morn, in a full house alike exhausted and excited, and after having\nendured for hours, in sarcastic silence, the menacing finger of Sir\nRobert, shaking over the green table and appealing to his misdeeds in\nthe irrevocable records of Hansard, Lord John himself could not have\nafforded a more perfect representative of pluck.But loud as was the laughter, and vehement the cheering, with which\nLucian's performances were received, all these ebullitions sank into\ninsignificance compared with the reception which greeted what he himself\nannounced was to be the speech of the night.Having quaffed full many\na quaigh of toddy, he insisted on delivering, it on the table, a\nproposition with which his auditors immediately closed.The orator appeared, the great man of the night, who was to answer\neverybody on both sides.that harsh voice, that arrogant style,\nthat saucy superficiality which decided on everything, that insolent\nignorance that contradicted everybody; it was impossible to mistake\nthem!And Coningsby had the pleasure of seeing reproduced before him the\nguardian of his youth and the patron of the mimic, the Right Honourable\nNicholas Rigby!Madame Colonna, with that vivacious energy which characterises the\nsouth, had no sooner seen Coningsby, and heard his praises celebrated\nby his grandfather, than she resolved that an alliance should sooner\nor later take place between him and her step-daughter.She imparted her\nprojects without delay to Lucretia, who received them in a different\nspirit from that in which they were communicated.Lucretia bore as\nlittle resemblance to her step-mother in character, as in person.If\nshe did not possess her beauty, she was born with an intellect of far\ngreater capacity and reach.A hasty alliance\nwith a youth, arranged by their mutual relatives, might suit very well\nthe clime and manners of Italy, but Lucretia was well aware that it was\naltogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.She had\nno conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her, or, if\nwilling, that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet\nonly on the threshold of the world.Lucretia therefore received\nthe suggestions and proposals of Madarne Colonna with coldness and\nindifference; one might even say contempt, for she neither felt respect\nfor this lady, nor was she sedulous to evince it.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Although really\nyounger than Coningsby, Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is, in\nall worldly considerations, ten years older than a youth of the same\nage.She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before\nConingsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage,\nwhile, on the other hand, she was not only anxious, but resolved, not\nto delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which\nshe very frequently found herself.Lucretia felt rather than expressed these ideas and impressions.She\nwas not naturally communicative, and conversed with no one with less\nfrankness and facility than with her step-mother.Madame Colonna\ntherefore found no reasons in her conversation with Lucretia to change\nher determination.As her mind was not ingenious she did not see\nquestions in those various lights which make us at the same time infirm\nof purpose and tolerant.What she fancied ought to be done, she fancied\nmust be done; for she perceived no middle course or alternative.For\nthe rest, Lucretia's carriage towards her gave her little discomfort.Besides, she herself, though good-natured, was obstinate.Her feelings\nwere not very acute; nothing much vexed her.As long as she had fine\ndresses, good dinners, and opera-boxes, she could bear her plans to be\ncrossed like a philosopher; and her consolation under her unaccomplished\ndevices was her admirable consistency, which always assured her that her\nprojects were wise, though unfulfilled.Rigby, that she might gain not only his\nadhesion to her views, but his assistance in achieving them.Rigby's estimation, exercised more influence over Lord\nMonmouth than any other individual, faithful to his policy or practice,\nhe agreed with all Madame Colonna's plans and wishes, and volunteered\ninstantly to further them.As for the Prince, his wife never consulted\nhim on any subject, nor did he wish to be consulted.On the contrary, he\nhad no opinion about anything.All that he required was that he should\nbe surrounded by what contributed to his personal enjoyment, that he\nshould never be troubled, and that he should have billiards.He was not\ninexpert in field-sports, rode indeed very well for an Italian, but\nhe never cared to be out-of-doors; and there was only one room in the\ninterior which passionately interested him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.It was where the echoing\nballs denoted the sweeping hazard or the effective cannonade.That was\nthe chamber where the Prince Colonna literally existed.Half-an-hour\nafter breakfast he was in the billiard-room; he never quitted it until\nhe dressed for dinner; and he generally contrived, while the world were\namused or amusing themselves at the comedy or in the dance, to steal\ndown with some congenial sprites to the magical and illumined chamber,\nand use his cue until bedtime.Faithful to her first impressions, Lucretia had made no difference\nin her demeanour to Coningsby to that which she offered to the other\nguests.Polite, but uncommunicative; ready to answer, but never\noriginating conversation; she charmed him as little by her manner as by\nher person; and after some attempts, not very painstaking, to interest\nher, Coningsby had ceased to address her.The day passed by with only a\nfaint recognition between them; even that sometimes omitted.When, however, Lucretia observed that Coningsby had become one of the\nmost notable persons in the Castle; when she heard everywhere of\nhis talents and accomplishments, his beauty and grace and great\nacquirements, and perceived that he was courted by all; that Lord\nMonmouth omitted no occasion publicly to evince towards him his regard\nand consideration; that he seemed generally looked upon in the light of\nhis grandfather's heir; and that Lady St.Julians, more learned in that\nrespect than any lady in the kingdom, was heard more than once to regret\nthat she had not brought another daughter with her, Clara Isabella, as\nwell as Augustina; the Princess Lucretia began to imagine that Madame\nColonna, after all, might not be so extravagant in her purpose as she\nhad first supposed.She, therefore, surprised Coningsby with the almost\naffectionate moroseness with which, while she hated to sing, she yet\nfound pleasure in singing for him alone.And it is impossible to say\nwhat might not have been the next move in her tactics in this respect,\nhad not the very night on which she had resolved to commence the\nenchantment of Coningsby introduced to her Sidonia.The Princess Lucretia encountered the dark still glance of the friend of\nLord Eskdale.He, too, beheld a woman unlike other women, and with his\nfine experience, both as a man and as a physiologist, felt that he was\nin the presence of no ordinary organisation.From the evening of his\nintroduction Sidonia sought the society of the Princess Lucretia.She threw out her mind in various and\nhighly-cultivated intelligence.He recognised in her a deep and subtile\nspirit, considerable reading for a woman, habits of thought, and a soul\npassionate and daring.She resolved to subdue one whose appreciation she\nhad gained, and who had subdued her.The profound meaning and the calm\nmanner of Sidonia combined to quell her spirit.She tried to rival his power; to cope with him, and with\nthe same weapons.But prompt as was her thought and bright as was\nits expression, her heart beat in tumult; and, with all her apparent\nserenity, her agitated soul was a prey of absorbing passion.She could\nnot contend with that intelligent, yet inscrutable, eye; with that\nmanner so full of interest and respect, and yet so tranquil.Here was a girl contending with a man\nlearned in the world's way.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the apple.Between Sidonia and Coningsby there at once occurred companionship.The\nmorning after his arrival they went out shooting together.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which\nshould attempt to beguile you from", "question": "Where is the apple?

Y., on Saturday, April 30th, 1864,\nin the 81st year of his age.Beals was born in Boston, Mass.,\nNovember 13, 1783.He came to this village in October, 1803, only 14 years after the first\nsettlement of the place.He was married in March, 1805, to Abigail\nField, sister of the first pastor of the Congregational church here.Her\nfamily, in several of its branches, have since been distinguished in the\nministry, the legal profession, and in commercial enterprise.Living to a good old age, and well known as one of our most wealthy and\nrespected citizens, Mr.Beals is another added to the many examples of\nsuccessful men who, by energy and industry, have made their own fortune.On coming to this village, he was teacher in the Academy for a time, and\nafterward entered into mercantile business, in which he had his share of\nvicissitude.When the Ontario Savings Bank was established, 1832, he\nbecame the Treasurer, and managed it successfully till the institution\nceased, in 1835, with his withdrawal.In the meantime he conducted,\nalso, a banking business of his own, and this was continued until a week\nprevious to his death, when he formally withdrew, though for the last\nfive years devolving its more active duties upon his son.As a banker, his sagacity and fidelity won for him the confidence and\nrespect of all classes of persons in this community.The business\nportion of our village is very much indebted to his enterprise for the\neligible structures he built that have more than made good the losses\nsustained by fires.More than fifty years ago he was actively concerned\nin the building of the Congregational church, and also superintended the\nerection of the county jail and almshouse; for many years a trustee of\nCanandaigua Academy, and trustee and treasurer of the Congregational\nchurch.At the time of his death he and his wife, who survives him, were\nthe oldest members of the church, having united with it in 1807, only\neight years after its organization.Until hindered by the infirmities of\nage, he was a constant attendant of its services and ever devoutly\nmaintained the worship of God in his family.No person has been more\ngenerally known among all classes of our citizens.Whether at home or\nabroad he could not fail to be remarked for his gravity and dignity.His\ncharacter was original, independent, and his manners remarkable for a\ndignified courtesy.Our citizens were familiar with his brief, emphatic\nanswers with the wave of his hand.He was fond of books, a great reader,\ncollected a valuable number of volumes, and was happy in the use of\nlanguage both in writing and conversation.In many unusual ways he often\nshowed his kind consideration for the poor and afflicted, and many\npersons hearing of his death gratefully recollect instances, not known\nto others, of his seasonable kindness to them in trouble.In his\ncharities he often studied concealment as carefully as others court\ndisplay.His marked individuality of character and deportment, together\nwith his shrewd discernment and active habits, could not fail to leave a\ndistinct impression on the minds of all.For more than sixty years he transacted business in one place here, and\nhis long life thus teaches more than one generation the value of\nsobriety, diligence, fidelity and usefulness.In his last illness he remarked to a friend that he always loved\nCanandaigua; had done several things for its prosperity, and had\nintended to do more.He had known his measure of affliction; only four\nof eleven children survive him, but children and children's children\nministered to the comfort of his last days.Notwithstanding his years\nand infirmities, he was able to visit New York, returning April 18th\nquite unwell, but not immediately expecting a fatal termination.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.As the\nfinal event drew near, he seemed happily prepared to meet it.He\nconversed freely with his friends and neighbors in a softened and\nbenignant spirit, at once receiving and imparting benedictions.His end\nseemed to realize his favorite citation from Job: \"I shall die in my\nnest.\"His funeral was attended on Monday in the Congregational church by a\nlarge assembly, Dr.Daggett, the pastor, officiating on the\noccasion.--Written by Dr.O.

Clarke\nopened the exercises with the hymn \"He leadeth me,\" followed by \"Though\nthe days are dark with sorrow,\" \"We know not what's before us,\" \"My days\nare gliding swiftly by.\"Clarke said that we always meant to\nsing \"America,\" after every victory, and last Monday he was wondering if\nwe would not have to sing it twice to-day, or add another verse, but our\nfeelings have changed since then.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.Nevertheless he thought we had better\nsing \"America,\" for we certainly ought to love our country more than\never, now that another, and such another, martyr, had given up his life\nfor it.Then he talked to the children and said that last\nFriday was supposed to be the anniversary of the day upon which our Lord\nwas crucified, and though, at the time the dreadful deed was committed,\nevery one felt the day to be the darkest one the earth ever knew; yet\nsince then, the day has been called \"Good Friday,\" for it was the death\nof Christ which gave life everlasting to all the people.So he thought\nthat life would soon come out of darkness, which now overshadows us all,\nand that the death of Abraham Lincoln might yet prove the nation's life\nin God's own most mysterious way.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office._Wednesday evening, April_ 19, 1865.--This being the day set for the\nfuneral of Abraham Lincoln at

we can gather the coveted treasure,\n   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;\n   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,\n   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour\n   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,\n   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,\n   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,\n   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,\n

but alas!not\nunderstanding the nature of the instrument he was using, the poor\ncreature cut so deep a gash, that he bled profusely.He was found in\nthe situation described, with the razor still in his fingers, but\nunfortunately was too far gone to be recovered, and soon died, leaving a\ncaution to his fellows against playing with edged tools.\"\"I hope Jacko will never see any body shave,\" said Minnie, in a\nfaltering voice.\"Here is a funny story, my dear, about a monkey in the West Indies.The\nlittle fellow was kept tied to a stake in the open air, and was\nfrequently deprived of his food by the Johnny Crows.He tried to drive\nthem off, but without success, and at last made the following plan for\npunishing the thieves.\"Perceiving a flock of these birds coming toward him one day just after\nhis food had been brought, he lay down near his stake, and pretended to\nbe dead.For some time, he lay perfectly motionless, when the birds,\nreally deceived, approached by degrees, and got near enough to steal his\nfood, which he allowed them to do.This game he repeated several times,\ntill they became so bold as to come within reach of his claws, when he\nsuddenly sprang up and caught his victim in his firm grasp.He wished to make a man of him, according\nto the ancient definition, 'a biped without feathers,' and therefore,\nplucking the crow neatly, he let him go to show himself to his\ncompanions.This proved so effectual a punishment, that he was\nafterwards left to eat his food in peace.\"\"I don't see,\" said Minnie, thoughtfully, \"how a monkey could ever think\nof such a way.\"\"It certainly does show a great deal of sagacity,\" responded the lady,\n\"and a great deal of cunning in carrying out his plan.\"\"I hope there are ever so many anecdotes, mamma.\"\"Yes, my dear,\" she said, cheerfully,\n\"there are quite a number;

for no amount of coaxing or\nflattery would induce Leo to be impressed into this service.He hated\nthe monkey, and was greatly disgusted at his appearance as he hopped,\nfirst on Frank's shoulder, and then to the ground, his head sticking out\nof his little red jacket, and his face wearing a malicious grin.Finding they could not succeed in this, they went into the stable to\nvisit Star, when, with a quick motion, Jacko twitched the chain from\nMinnie's hand, and running up the rack above the manger, began to laugh\nand chatter in great glee.His tail, which had now fully healed, was of great use to him on this\noccasion, when, to Minnie's great surprise, he clung with it to the bar\nof the rack, and began to swing himself about.[Illustration: JACKO RUNNING AWAY.\"I heard of a monkey once,\" exclaimed Frank, laughing merrily, \"who made\ngreat use of his tail.If a nut or apple were thrown to him which fell\nbeyond his reach, he would run to the full length of his chain, turn his\nback, then stretch out his tail, and draw toward him the coveted\ndelicacy.\"\"Let's see whether Jacko would do so,\" shouted Minnie, greatly excited\nwith the project.There he goes up the\nhay mow, the chain dangling after him.\"\"If we don't try to catch him, he'll come quicker,\" said Minnie,\ngravely.\"I know another story about a monkey--a real funny", "question": "Where is the apple?

but then she has so many pets to take\nup her attention.\"Just then the child ran in, her eyes filled with tears, exclaiming,--\n\n\"Father, does Jacko know any better?\"Because,\" she went on, \"I found him crouched down in his cage, looking\nvery sorry; and nurse says he ought to be ashamed of himself, cutting\nup such ridiculous capers.\"\"I dare say he feels rather guilty,\" remarked Mr.\"He must be\ntaught better, or your mother will be tired of him.\"When her father had gone to the city, Minnie looked so grave that her\nmother, to comfort her, took the book and read her some stories.A few\nof them I will repeat to you.\"A lady was returning from India, in a ship on board of which there was\na monkey.She was a very mild, gentle creature, and readily learned any\nthing that was taught her.When she went to lie down at night, she made\nup her bed in imitation of her mistress, then got in and wrapped herself\nup neatly with the quilt.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.Sometimes she would wrap her head with a\nhandkerchief.\"When she did wrong, she would kneel and clasp her hands, seeming\nearnestly to ask to be forgiven.\"\"A gentleman boarding with his wife at a hotel in Paris had a pet\nmonkey, who was very polite.One day his master met him going down\nstairs; and when the gentleman said 'good morning,' the animal took off\nhis cap and made a very polite bow.Upon\nthis the monkey held out a square piece of paper.said the gentleman; 'your mistress' gown is dusty.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.\"Jack instantly took a small brush from his master's pocket, raised the\nhem of the lady's dress, cleaned it, and then did the same to his\nmaster's shoes, which were also dusty.\"When they gave him any thing to eat, he did not cram his pouches with\nit, but delicately and tidily devoured it; and when, as frequently\noccurred, strangers gave him money, he always put it in his master's\nhands.\"\"Do you think, mamma, I could teach Jacko to do so?\"\"I can't say, my dear; and indeed I think it would be hardly worth the\npains to spend a great deal of time in teaching him.He seems to learn\nquite fast enough by himself.Indeed, he is so full of tricks, and so\ntroublesome to cook in hiding her kitchen utensils, I am afraid we shall\nhave to put him in close confinement.\"\"I had rather uncle Frank would carry him back to Africa,\" sighed the\nchild.\"Well, dear, I wouldn't grieve about it now.We must manage somehow till\nuncle Frank comes, and then perhaps he can tell us what to do.\"A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome\nthat the servants were constantly complaining.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.\"That seems similar to our case,\" said the lady, smiling, as she\ninterrupted the reading.\"One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into\nthe next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately\nopen.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,\nlaces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away\nvigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be\nfound in the room.\"When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in\nspreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry.\"He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to\nhim, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case\nof the large kitchen clock.\"The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his\nplace of refuge when he was in disgrace.\"One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for\ndinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon\nmanaged to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam\nfowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and\nbegan plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the\nservants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in\nsuch a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,\n\"I wonder how old that monkey was.\"\"The book does not mention his age, my dear.\"I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;\nand then I said to myself, 'That one must have been young.'\"\"If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,\"\nremarked the lady.\"His company does not begin to compensate for the\ntrouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and\ntractable.\"\"And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?\"\"I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better\nkind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny\ntricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I\nknew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I\nshould be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; \"O, mamma, I wouldn't\nhave one of my pets killed for any thing.\"Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie's fate, but\nshe wisely said nothing.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the milk.I don't want to think about such awful\nthings.\"The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Presently\nshe said, \"Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but\nfirst I must explain to you what a sounding-board is.\"In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the\npulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was\nthought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the\ncongregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my\ngrandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a\nsounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would\nfall on the minister's head and kill him.\"There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept\nin his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,\nwhich was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he\nwent out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out\nof sight, on his way to church.\"But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under\nhis arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the\nopportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,\nran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board.\"Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on\nthe congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle.\"The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much\nenjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the\nsounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was\nunconscious of his presence.\"When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with\nlaughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it\nhis duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action\nof his hands and arms.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple.\"The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every\nmotion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the\ncountenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the\nmost solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity\nappear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,\nevery word being enforced by great energy of action.\"All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with\nardor and exactness.\"The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man\nand his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of\ncomposure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one\nof the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the\nirreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the\nmerriment.\"Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal\nstanding on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his\nmight, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly\nexasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey\nremoved, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to\nrecover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed.\"CHAPTER V.\n\nJACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching\nmice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to\ngood account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,\ndetermined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.Lee on a journey,\nand shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his\ncomfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every\nthing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and\nwell secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this\ntreatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup\ntureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over\nthe place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke\nshivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup\ntureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he\nbegan to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on\nthe upper shelf.\"There is something good,\" he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,\nraspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,\ndisappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in\na corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave\na scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a\nthousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her\nthat this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,\nwho began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his\nst", "question": "Where is the apple?

servants for trying such an\nexperiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new\nmischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,\nlaughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as\nhe said, \"We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;\nbut you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.\"\"Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?\"\"I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I\ncan find any for you.\"He opened the book, and then asked,--\n\n\"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in\ntheir cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the\nanimal look wrinkled?\"\"No, sir; I never heard about it.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.He puts his food in them, and keeps it there\ntill he wishes to devour it.\"There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;\nthat is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,\nand which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The\nfacility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the\nbranches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it\nmakes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,\nit is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it\nto swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.\"\"I'm sure, father,\" eagerly cried Minnie, \"that Jacko has a prehensile\ntail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the\nhay mow.\"<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.But here is an\naccount of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black\nhands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called\nHoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be\none of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to\ndeath; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy\ngreat quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by\nthe natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone\nwould compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us\nthat their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are\nraised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in\nwhich they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A\nhand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum\nin Paris.\"\"Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures\nor hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other\nsubstances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they\ndo not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general\ncry being kept up by the party.\"One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor.\"Mamma,\" she\nexclaimed, \"cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families.\"I suppose, my dear,\" she responded, \"that there is a\ndifference of disposition among them.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.I have heard that they are very\nfond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount\nthem on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection.\"But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,\nand if I can find the book, I will read it to you.\"\"There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most\nbeautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from\nits extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at\nliberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in\norder to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a\nwife.\"For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every\nattention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much\ncruelty.\"One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than\nusual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,\nafter winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and\ndrew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave\nher a push, which threw her into the sea.\"This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he\ndescended in high spirits.\"\"I should think they would have punished him,\" said Minnie, with great\nindignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no\nmeans always to be depended upon.\"Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one\nmore story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,\ncomplied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this\nchapter on Minnie's pet monkey.\"A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented\nto his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it.\"Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress\nused sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him\nrun up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.\"On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,\nran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and\nchattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,\n'Catch me if you can.'<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally\nleaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled\nhimself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth\nopen, his sides ready to burst with his running.\"Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former\nexperience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at\ncleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the\nhandle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he\nrelinquished the sport.\"Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and\nboots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering\nall the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole\nand all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &\nMartin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.His coat was\na nice mess for some days after.\"One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found\nSprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and\narranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he\nheard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as\nthough nothing had happened.Occasionally a bowl of water was\ngiven him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his\nfinger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the\nother, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed\nhimself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped\nout and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during\nthis performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his\nmight to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over\nthem.As he was brought from a\nvery warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the\ncold.\"The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his\nbasket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning\nhe frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of\nmaking the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet.\"One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on\nthe tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.He jumped from\nhis basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it\njust the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving\nonly his head above the water.\"This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water\nbegan to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly\nsat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have\nbeen boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and\nfirmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,\nwho, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head\nand pulled him out.\"He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon\nrecovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot\nexperience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire.\"When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a\nmenagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was\ngreatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty\nquestions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their\nway home, she inquired,--\n\n\"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?\"\"Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot\nconceive of.\"\"I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets,\" added her\nmother, laughing.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\"I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,\"\nanswered the child.\"But, father, will you please tell me something\nmore about the curious animals?\"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had\nstopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered\nabout some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to\nget out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,\nand then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in\nthe road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had\ngone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which\nMinnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like\nher.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it\nseemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he\nfound her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave\nJohn orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering\nwhether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy\npaid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature\nmust be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many\nadmonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her\nthoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the\nanimal, which he read to her.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.\"The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like\nhead, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form\nand position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and\nhands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as\nit is disgusting.\"\"Then follows an account,\" the gentleman went on, \"of the peculiarities\nof different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.\"\"But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?\"\"I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that\nthey are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper.\"They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the\nseverest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.The firmness of the grasp which it\nmakes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,\nit is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it\nto swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.\"\"I'm sure, father,\" eagerly cried Minnie, \"that Jacko has a prehensile\ntail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the\nhay mow.\"But here is an\naccount of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow

but soon the water\nbegan to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly\nsat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have\nbeen boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and\nfirmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,\nwho, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head\nand pulled him out.\"He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon\nrecovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot\nexperience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire.\"When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a\nmenagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was\ngreatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty\nquestions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their\nway home, she inquired,--\n\n\"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?\"\"Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot\nconceive of.\"\"I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets,\" added her\nmother, laughing.\"I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,\"\nanswered the child.\"But, father, will you please tell me something\nmore about the curious animals?\"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had\nstopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered\nabout some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to\nget out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,\nand then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.He had been in\nthe road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had\ngone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which\nMinnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like\nher.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it\nseemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he\nfound her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave\nJohn orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering\nwhether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy\npaid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature\nmust be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many\nadmonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her\nthoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the\nanimal, which he read to her.\"The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like\nhead, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form\nand position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and\nhands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as\nit is disgusting.\"\"Then follows an account,\" the gentleman went on, \"of the peculiarities\nof different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.\"\"But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?\"\"I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that\nthey are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper.\"They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the\nseverest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to\ntheir own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions\nare cruel, destructive, and disgusting.\"\"I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples,\" said Minnie;

but they greatly fear the\ngun.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.\"As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage\nincreases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible\nfury.\"\"Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking\nencyclopaedia.\"Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless\nthey go into gardens?\"\"I rather think I should soon convince them they\nwere not to enter my garden,\" he said, emphatically.\"But seriously,\nthey descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in\na few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,\nthey move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to\ngive notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,\nthe sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with\nthe greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into\ntheir cheek pouches.\"Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her\nmother said, \"I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named\nKees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.\"\"Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,\"\nsaid the gentleman, rising.\"It was in a book of travels in Africa,\" the lady went on.\"The\ntraveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his\njourney, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a\nsentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his\nsense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of\nprey, when every thing was apparently secure.\"There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they\ncame across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were\nunacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he\nthrew them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or\ndisagreeable, and left them untasted.\"Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these\nexcursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the\nsport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he\nshowed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance\nabout, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was\nvery fond.\"I recall one amusing trick of Kees,\" said the lady, laughing, \"which\npleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows\nof trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of\nwhich his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he\nwould run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it\nas fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him.\"These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner\nof doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong\nteeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself\ngradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,\nwhile he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,\nwhich gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come\nout.\"Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired\nwith the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the\ndogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew\nweary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into\nservice.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.As soon as Kees leaped on\nhis back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the\nspot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until\nthe party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great\nhaste to overtake their master.\"Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.They were\naccustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the\nslightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their\nplaces about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them\ncame too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,\nand thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.\"\"Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed,\" said Minnie,\nwith considerable warmth.\"I have told you the best traits of his character,\" she answered,\nsmiling.\"He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He\ncould not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He\nunderstood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take\nthe cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it\nwhenever he had a chance.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.He was whipped repeatedly for these\nmisdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good.\"Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his\nservants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any\nthing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,\ngenerally deserved it.\"The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the\nplace; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the\nbroken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a\nsevere beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the\ngentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as\nsoon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast.\"One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of\na bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had\ncarefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran\nout of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,\nbut found not a bean left, and Kees missing.\"When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some\nhours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched\nevery where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really\ndeserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a\ndistance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and\nspoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not\ncome down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take\nhim.\"\"No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only\none thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le\nVaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,\npretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that\ntime could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at\na distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;\nand had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the\ninsult.\"*       *       *       *       *\n\n    \"Nature is man's best teacher.She unfolds\n    Her treasures to his search, unseals his eye,\n    Illumes his mind, and purifies his heart,--\n    An influence breathes from all the sights and sounds\n    Of her existence;

the dancing-lesson.\"Right willingly the family all seated themselves around the blazing\nfire, and the raccoon began as follows:--\n\n\nTHE USEFUL COAL.There was once a king whose name was Sligo.He was noted both for his\nriches and his kind heart.One evening, as he sat by his fireside, a\ncoal fell out on the hearth.The King took up the tongs, intending to\nput it back on the fire, but the coal said:--\n\n\"If you will spare my life, and do as I tell you, I will save your\ntreasure three times, and tell you the name of the thief who steals it.\"These words gave the King great joy, for much treasure had been stolen\nfrom him of late, and none of his officers could discover the culprit.So he set the coal on the table, and said:--\n\n\"Pretty little black and red bird, tell me, what shall I do?\"\"Put me in your waistcoat pocket,\" said the coal, \"and take no more\nthought for to-night.\"Accordingly the King put the coal in his pocket, and then, as he sat\nbefore the warm fire, he grew drowsy, and presently fell fast asleep.When he had been asleep some time, the door opened, very softly, and the\nHigh Cellarer peeped cautiously in.This was the one of the King's\nofficers who had been most eager in searching for the thief.Salome--Sheba--no, no![_Bounding in and rushing at THE DEAN._] Papa, Papa![_SALOME seizes his hands, SHEBA his coat-tails, and turn him

on the next line, if there was not.-  If the stage directions were two lines, they were indented from the\nleft margin as hanging paragraphs.How much the stage directions were\nindented varied.In the etext, all stage directions not before or within dialogue are\nplaced on the next line, indented the same amount from the left\nmargin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.Inspector Sanders took the\nwire, read it and stood very erect.\"Looks like it, sir,\" he replied.\"It is just eight months since I first warned the government that\ntrouble would come.Superintendent Crozier knows the situation\nthoroughly and would not have sent this wire if outbreak were not\nimminent.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.Then here is one from Superintendent Gagnon at Carlton.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the kitchen.\"We ought to have five hundred men on the spot this minute,\" he said.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.\"I have asked that a hundred men be sent up at once,\" said the\nCommissioner, \"but I am doubtful if we can get the Government to agree.It seems almost impossible to make the authorities feel the gravity\nof the situation.They cannot realize, for one thing, the enormous\ndistances that separate points that look comparatively near together\nupon the map.\"\"And yet,\" he\ncontinued, \"they have these maps before them, and the figures, but\nsomehow the facts do not impress them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.Look at this vast area lying\nbetween these four posts that form an almost perfect quadrilateral.Here is the north line running from Edmonton at the northwest corner\nto Prince Albert at the northeast, nearly four hundred miles away;\nthen here is the south line running from Macleod at the southwest four\nhundred and fifty miles to Regina at the southeast; while the sides of\nthis quadrilateral are nearly three hundred miles long.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.Thus the four\nposts forming our quadrilateral are four hundred miles apart one way by\nthree hundred another, and, if we run the lines down to the boundary and\nto the limit of the territory which we patrol, the disturbed area may\ncome to be about five hundred miles by six hundred; and we have some\nfive hundred men available.\"\"It is a good thing we have established the new post at Carlton,\"\nsuggested Inspector Sanders.It is true we have strengthened up that\ndistrict recently with two hundred men distributed between Battleford,\nPrince Albert, Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton.But Carlton is naturally a\nvery weak post and is practically of little use to us.True, it guards\nus against those Willow Crees and acts as a check upon old Beardy.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.\"A troublesome man, that Kah-me-yes-too-waegs--old Beardy, I mean.It\ntook me some time to master that one,\" said Inspector Sanders, \"but then\nI have studied German.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the office.He always has been a nuisance,\" continued the\nInspector.\"He was a groucher when the treaty was made in '76 and he has\nbeen a groucher ever since.\"\"If we only had the men, just another five hundred,\" replied the\nCommissioner, tapping the map before him with his finger, \"we should\nhold this country safe.But what with these restless half-breeds led by\nthis crack-brained Riel, and these ten thousand Indians--\"\n\n\"Not to speak of a couple of thousand non-treaty Indians roaming the\ncountry and stirring up trouble,\" interjected the Inspector.\"True enough,\" replied the Commissioner, \"but I would have no fear\nof the Indians were it not for these half-breeds.They have real\ngrievances, remember, Sanders, real grievances, and that gives force to\ntheir quarrel and cohesion to the movement.Men who have a conviction\nthat they are suffering injustice are not easily turned aside.They ride hard and shoot straight and are afraid of\nnothing.I confess frankly it looks very serious to me.\"\"For my part,\" said Inspector Sanders, \"it is the Indians I fear most.\"Really,\none wonders at the docility of the Indians, and their response to fair\nand decent treatment.Twenty years ago, no,\nfifteen years ago, less than fifteen years ago, these Indians whom we\nhave been holding in our hand so quietly were roaming these plains,\nliving like lords on the buffalo and fighting like fiends with each\nother, free from all control.Little wonder if, now feeling the pinch of\nfamine, fretting under the monotony of pastoral life, and being\nincited to war by the hot-blooded half-breeds, they should break out\nin rebellion.Just this, a feeling\nthat they have been justly treated, fairly and justly dealt with by the\nGovernment, and a wholesome respect for Her Majesty's North West Mounted\nPolice, if I do say it myself.But the thing is on, and we must be\nready.\"\"Well, thank God, there is not much to be done in the way of\npreparation,\" replied the Commissioner.For the past six months we have been on the alert for this emergency,\nbut we must strike promptly.When I think of these settlers about Prince\nAlbert and Battleford at the mercy of Beardy and that restless and\ntreacherous Salteaux, Big Bear, I confess to a terrible anxiety.\"\"Then there is the West, sir, as well,\" said Sanders, \"the Blackfeet and\nthe Bloods.\"So do I. It is a great matter\nthat Crowfoot is well disposed toward us, that he has confidence in our\nofficers and that he is a shrewd old party as well.But Crowfoot is an\nIndian and the head of a great tribe with warlike traditions and with\nambitions, and he will find it difficult to maintain his own loyalty,\nand much more that of his young men, in the face of any conspicuous\nsuccesses by his Indian rivals, the Crees.But,\" added the Commissioner,\nrolling up the map, \"I called you in principally to say that I wish you\nto have every available man and gun ready for a march at a day's notice.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.Further, I wish you to wire Superintendent Herchmer at Calgary to\nsend at the earliest possible moment twenty-five men at least, fully\nequipped.We shall need every man we can spare from every post in the\nWest to send North.\"They will be ready,\" said Inspector Sanders, and,\nsaluting, he left the room.Two days later, on the 18th of March, long before the break of day, the\nCommissioner set out on his famous march to Prince Albert, nearly three\nhundred miles away.They were but a small\ncompany of ninety men, but every man was thoroughly fit for the part\nhe was expected to play in the momentous struggle before him; brave, of\ncourse, trained in prompt initiative, skilled in plaincraft, inured to\nhardship, oblivious of danger, quick of eye, sure of hand and rejoicing\nin fight.Commissioner Irvine knew he could depend upon them to see\nthrough to a finish, to their last ounce of strength and their last\nblood-drop, any bit of work given them to do.Past Pie-a-pot's Reserve\nand down the Qu'Appelle Valley to Misquopetong's, through the Touchwood\nHills and across the great Salt Plain, where he had word by wire from\nCrozier of the first blow being struck at the south branch of the\nSaskatchewan where some of Beardy's men gave promise of their future\nconduct by looting a store, Irvine pressed his march.Onward along the\nSaskatchewan, he avoided the trap laid by four hundred half-breeds at\nBatoche's Crossing, and, making the crossing at Agnew's, further down,\narrived at Prince Albert all fit and sound on the eve of the 24th,\ncompleting his two hundred and ninety-one miles in just seven days; and\nthat in the teeth of the bitter weather of a rejuvenated winter, without\nloss of man or horse, a feat worthy of the traditions of the Force of\nwhich he was the head, and of the Empire whose most northern frontier it\nwas his task to guard.Twenty-four hours to sharpen their horses' calks and tighten up their\ncinches, and Irvine was on the trail again en route for Fort Carlton,\nwhere he learned serious disturbances were threatening.Arrived at Fort\nCarlton in the afternoon of the same day, the Commissioner found there a\ncompany of men, sad, grim and gloomy.In the fort a dozen of the gallant\nvolunteers from Prince Albert and Crozier's Mounted Police lay groaning,\nsome of them dying, with wounds.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.Others lay with their faces covered,\nquiet enough; while far down on the Duck Lake trail still others lay\nwith the white snow red about them.The story was told the Commissioner\nwith soldierlike brevity by Superintendent Crozier.The previous day a\nstorekeeper from Duck Lake, Mitchell by name, had ridden in to report\nthat his stock of provisions and ammunition was about to be seized by\nthe rebels.Immediately early next morning a Sergeant of the Police with\nsome seventeen constables had driven off to prevent these provisions and\nammunition falling into the hands of the enemy.At ten o'clock a scout\ncame pounding down the trail with the announcement that Sergeant Stewart\nwas in trouble and that a hundred rebels had disputed his advance.Hard upon the heels of the scout came the Sergeant himself with his\nconstables to tell their tale to a body of men whose wrath grew as\nthey listened.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple there.More and more furious waxed their rage as they heard\nthe constables tell of the threats and insults heaped upon them by the\nhalf-breeds and Indians.The Prince Albert volunteers more especially\nwere filled with indignant rage.To think that half-breeds and\nIndians--Indians, mark you!--whom they had been accustomed to regard\nwith contempt, should have dared to turn back upon the open trail a\ncompany of men wearing the Queen's uniform!The Police officers received the news with philosophic calm.It was\nmerely an incident in the day's work to them.Sooner or later they would\nbring these bullying half-breeds and yelling Indians to task for their\ntemerity.But the volunteers were undisciplined in the business of receiving\ninsults.The Superintendent\npointed out that the Commissioner was within touch bringing\nreinforcements.It might be wise to delay matters a few hours till his\narrival.But meantime the provisions and ammunition would be looted\nand distributed among the enemy, and that was a serious matter.The\nimpetuous spirit of the volunteers prevailed.Within an hour a hundred\nmen with a seven-pr.gun, eager to exact punishment for the insults\nthey had suffered, took the Duck Lake trail.Ambushed by a foe who,\nregardless of the conventions of war, made treacherous use of the white\nflag, overwhelmed by more than twice their number, hampered in their\nevolutions by the deep crusted snow, the little company, after a\nhalf-hour's sharp engagement with the strongly posted enemy, were forced\nto retire, bearing their wounded and some of their dead with them,\nleaving others of their dead lying in the snow behind them.And now the question was what was to be done?The events of the day\nhad taught them their lesson, a lesson that experience has taught all\nsoldiers, the lesson, namely, that it is never safe to despise a foe.A few miles away from them were between three hundred and four hundred\nhalf-breeds and Indians who, having tasted blood, were eager for more.The fort at Carlton was almost impossible of defense.The whole South\ncountry was in the hands of rebels.Companies of half-breeds breathing\nblood and fire, bands of Indians, marauding and terrorizing, were\nroaming the country, wrecking homesteads, looting stores, threatening\ndestruction to all loyal settlers and direst vengeance upon all who\nshould dare to oppose them.The situation called for quick thought and\nquick action.Every hour added to the number of the enemy.Whole tribes\nof Indians were wavering in their allegiance.Another victory such as\nDuck Lake and they would swing to the side of the rebels.The strategic\ncenter of the English settlements in all this country was undoubtedly\nPrince Albert.Fort Carlton stood close to the border of the half-breed\nsection and was difficult of defense.After a short council of war it was decided to abandon Fort Carlton.Thereupon Irvine led his troops, together with the gallant survivors of\nthe bloody fight at Duck Lake, bearing their dead and wounded with\nthem, to Prince Albert, there to hold that post with its hundreds of\ndefenseless women and children gathered in from the country round about,\nagainst hostile half-breeds without and treacherous half-breeds within\nthe stockade, and against swarming bands of Indians hungry for loot and\nthirsting for blood.And there Irvine, chafing against inactivity, eager\nfor the joyous privilege of attack, spent the weary anxious days of the\nnext six weeks, held at his post by the orders of his superior officer\nand by the stern necessities of the case, and meantime finding some\nslight satisfaction in scouting and scouring the country for miles on\nevery side, thus preventing any massing of the enemy's forces.The affair at Duck Lake put an end to all parley.Riel had been\nclamoring for \"blood!At Duck Lake he received his first\ntaste, but before many days were over he was to find that for every drop\nof blood that reddened the crusted snow at Duck Lake a thousand Canadian\nvoices would indignantly demand vengeance.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.The rifle-shots that rang out\nthat winter day from the bluffs that lined the Duck Lake trail echoed\nthroughout Canada from ocean to ocean, and everywhere men sprang to\noffer themselves in defense of their country.But echoes of these\nrifle-shots rang, too, in the teepees on the Western plains where the\nPiegans, the Bloods and the Blackfeet lay crouching and listening.By some mysterious system of telegraphy known only to themselves old\nCrowfoot and his braves heard them almost as soon as the Superintendent\nat Fort Macleod.Instantly every teepee was pulsing with the fever of\nwar.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.The young braves dug up their rifles from their bedding, gathered\ntogether their ammunition, sharpened their knives and tomahawks in eager\nanticipation of the call that would set them on the war-path against the\nwhite man who had robbed them of their ancient patrimony and who held\nthem in such close leash.The great day had come, the day they had been\ndreaming of in their hearts, talking over at their council-fires and\nsinging about in their sun dances during the past year, the day promised\nby the many runners from their brother Crees of the North, the day\nforetold by the great Sioux orator and leader, Onawata.The war of\nextermination had begun and the first blood had gone to the Indian and\nto his brother half-breed.Two days after Duck Lake came the word that Fort Carlton had been\nabandoned and Battleford sacked.Five days later the news of the bloody\nmassacre of Frog Lake cast over every English settlement the shadow of\na horrible fear.From the Crow's Nest to the Blackfoot Crossing bands of\nbraves broke loose from the reserves and began to \"drive cattle\" for the\nmaking of pemmican in preparation for the coming campaign.It was a day of testing for all Canadians, but especially a day of\ntesting for the gallant little force of six or seven hundred riders who,\ndistributed in small groups over a vast area of over<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "For while the Ottawa authorities with\nlate but frantic haste were hustling their regiments from all parts of\nCanada to the scene of war, the Mounted Police had gripped the situation\nwith a grip so stern that the Indian allies of the half-breed rebels\npaused in their leap, took a second thought and decided to wait till\nevents should indicate the path of discretion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.And, to the blood-lusting Riel, Irvine's swift thrust Northward to\nPrince Albert suggested caution, while his resolute stand at that\ndistant fort drove hard down in the North country a post of Empire that\nstuck fast and sure while all else seemed to be sliding to destruction.Inspector Dickens, too, another of that fearless band of Police\nofficers, holding with his heroic little company of twenty-two\nconstables Fort Pitt in the far North, stayed the panic consequent upon\nthe Frog Lake massacre and furnished food for serious thought to the\ncunning Chief, Little Pine, and his four hundred and fifty Crees, as\nwell as to the sullen Salteaux, Big Bear, with his three hundred braves.And to the lasting credit of Inspector Dickens it stands that he brought\nhis little company of twenty-two safe through a hostile country\noverrun with excited Indians and half-breeds to the post of Battleford,\nninety-eight miles away.At Battleford, also, after the sacking of the town, Inspector Morris\nwith two hundred constables behind his hastily-constructed barricade\nkept guard over four hundred women and children and held at bay a horde\nof savages yelling for loot and blood.Griesbach, in like manner, with his little handful, at Fort\nSaskatchewan, held the trail to Edmonton, and materially helped to bar\nthe way against Big Bear and his marauding band.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the apple there.And similarly at other points the promptness, resource, wisdom and\ndauntless resolution of the gallant officers of the Mounted Police\nand of the men they commanded saved Western Canada from the complete\nsubversion of law and order in the whole Northern part of the\nterritories and from the unspeakable horrors of a general Indian\nuprising.But while in the Northern and Eastern part of the Territories the Police\nofficers rendered such signal service in the face of open rebellion, it\nwas in the foothill country in the far West that perhaps even greater\nservice was rendered to Canada and the Empire in this time of peril by\nthe officers and men of the Mounted Police.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.It was due to the influence of such men as the Superintendents and\nInspectors of the Police in charge of the various posts throughout\nthe foothill country more than to anything else that the Chiefs of\nthe \"great, warlike, intelligent and untractable tribes\" of Blackfeet,\nBlood, Piegan, Sarcee and Stony Indians were prevented from breaking\ntheir treaties and joining with the rebel Crees, Salteaux and\nAssiniboines of the North and East.For fifteen years the Chiefs of\nthese tribes had lived under the firm and just rule of the Police, had\nbeen protected from the rapacity of unscrupulous traders and saved from\nthe ravages of whisky-runners.It was the proud boast of a Blood Chief\nthat the Police never broke a promise to the Indian and never failed to\nexact justice either for his punishment or for his protection.Hence when the reserves were being overrun by emissaries from the\nturbulent Crees and from the plotting half-breeds, in the face of the\nimpetuous demands of their own young men and of their minor Chiefs to\njoin in the Great Adventure, the great Chiefs, Red Crow and Rainy Chief\nof the Bloods, Bull's Head of the Sarcees, Trotting Wolf of the Piegans,\nand more than all, Crowfoot, the able, astute, wise old head of\nthe entire Blackfeet confederacy, held these young braves back from\nrebellion and thus gave time and opportunity to Her Majesty's Forces\noperating in the East and North to deal with the rebels.And during those days of strain, strain beyond the estimate of all\nnot immediately involved, it was the record of such men as the\nSuperintendents and Inspectors in charge at Fort Macleod, at Fort\nCalgary and on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction\nin the mountains, and their steady bearing that more than anything else\nweighed with the great Chiefs and determined for them their attitude.For with calm, cool courage the Police patrols rode in and out of the\nreserves, quietly reasoning with the big Chiefs, smiling indulgently\nupon the turbulent minor Chiefs, checking up with swift, firm, but\ntactful justice the many outbreaks against law and order, presenting\neven in their most desperate moments such a front of resolute\nself-confidence to the Indians, and refusing to give any sign by look\nor word or act of the terrific anxiety they carried beneath their gay\nscarlet coats.And the big Chiefs, reading the faces of these cool,\ncareless, resolute, smiling men who had a trick of appearing at\nunexpected times in their camps and refused to be hurried or worried,\nfinally decided to wait a little longer.And they waited till the fatal\nmoment of danger was past and the time for striking--and in the heart\nof every Chief of them the desire to strike for larger freedom and\nindependence lay deep--was gone.To these guardians of Empire who fought\nno fight, who endured no siege, who witnessed no massacre, the Dominion\nand the Empire owe more than none but the most observing will ever know.Paralleling these prompt measures of the North West Mounted Police, the\nGovernment dispatched from both East and West of Canada regiments of\nmilitia to relieve the beleaguered posts held by the Police, to prevent\nthe spread of rebellion and to hold the great tribes of the Indians of\nthe far West true to their allegiance.Already on the 27th of March, before Irvine had decided to abandon Fort\nCarlton and to make his stand at Prince Albert, General Middleton had\npassed through Winnipeg on his way to take command of the Canadian\nForces operating in the West; and before two weeks more had gone the\nGeneral was in command of a considerable body of troops at Qu'Appelle,\nhis temporary headquarters.From all parts of Canada these men gathered,\nfrom Quebec and Montreal, from the midland counties of Ontario, from\nthe city of Toronto and from the city of Winnipeg, till some five or six\nthousand citizen-soldiers were under arms.They were needed, too, every\nman, not so much because of the possible weight of numbers of the enemy\nopposing them, nor because of the tactical skill of those leading the\nhostile forces, but because of the enemy's advantage of position, owing\nto the nature of the country which formed the scene of the Rebellion,\nand because of the character of the warfare adopted by their cunning\nfoe.The record of the brief six weeks' campaign constitutes a creditable\npage in Canadian history, a page which no Canadian need blush to read\naloud in the presence of any company of men who know how to estimate at\ntheir highest value those qualities of courage and endurance that are\nthe characteristics of the British soldier the world over.Superintendent Strong was in a pleasant mood, and the reason was not far\nto seek.The distracting period of inaction, of doubt, of hesitation was\npast, and now at last something would be done.His term of service along\nthe line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction had been far from\ncongenial to him.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the football there.There had been too much of the work of the ordinary\npatrol-officer about it.True, he did his duty faithfully and\nthoroughly, so faithfully, indeed, as to move the great men of the\nrailway company to outspoken praise, a somewhat unusual circumstance.But now he was called back to the work that more properly belonged to an\nofficer of Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police and his soul glowed\nwith the satisfaction of those who, having been found faithful in\nuncongenial duty, are rewarded with an opportunity to do a bit of work\nwhich they particularly delight to do.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.With his twenty-five men, whom for the past year he had been polishing\nto a high state of efficiency in the trying work of police-duty in the\nrailway construction-camp, he arrived in Calgary on the evening of the\ntenth of April, to find that post throbbing with military ardor and\nthrilling with rumors of massacres and sieges, of marching columns and\ncontending forces.Small wonder that Superintendent Strong's face took\non an appearance of grim pleasure.Straight to the Police headquarters\nhe went, but there was no Superintendent there to welcome him.That\ngentleman had gone East to meet the troops and was by now under\nappointment as Chief of Staff to that dashing soldier, Colonel Otter.But meantime, though the Calgary Police Post was bare of men, there were\nother men as keen and as daring, if not so thoroughly disciplined for\nwar, thronging the streets of the little town and asking only a leader\nwhom they could follow.It was late evening, but Calgary was an \"all night\" town, and every\nminute was precious, for minutes might mean lives of women and children.So down the street rode Superintendent Strong toward the Royal Hotel.At\nthe hitching post of that hostelry a sad-looking broncho was tied, whose\ncalm, absorbed and detached appearance struck a note of discord with his\nenvironment; for everywhere about him men and horses seemed to be in\na turmoil of excitement.Everywhere men in cow-boy garb were careering\nabout the streets or grouped in small crowds about the saloon doors.There were few loud voices, but the words of those who were doing the\nspeaking came more rapidly than usual.<|begin_of_text|>Mary left the apple.Such a group was gathered in the rear of the sad-looking broncho before\nthe door of the Royal Hotel.As the Superintendent loped up upon his\nbig brown horse the group broke apart and, like birds disturbed at their\nfeeding, circled about and closed again.\"Hello, here's Superintendent Strong,\" said a voice.There were many voices, all eager, and in them just a touch of anxiety.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.\"Not a thing do I know,\" said Superintendent Strong somewhat gravely.\"I have been up in the mountains and have heard little.I know that the\nCommissioner has gone north to Prince Albert.\"\"Yes, I heard we had a reverse there, and I know that General Middleton\nhas arrived at Qu'Appelle and has either set out for the north or is\nabout to set out.\"For a moment there was silence, then a deep voice replied:\n\n\"A ghastly massacre, women and children and priests.\"murmured the Superintendent in a low voice.\"Yes, half-breeds and Indians,\" replied the deep voice.The Superintendent sat on his big horse looking at them quietly, then he\nsaid sharply:\n\n\"Men, there are some five or six thousand Indians in this district.\"Superintendent Cotton at Macleod has less than a hundred.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the kitchen.The men sat their horses in silence looking at him.One could hear their\ndeep breathing and see the quiver of the horses under the gripping knees\nof their riders.Ever since the news\nof the Frog Lake massacre had spread like a fire across the country\nthese men had been carrying in their minds--rather, in their\nhearts--pictures that started them up in their beds at night broad awake\nand all in a cold sweat.He had only a single word to say, a short sharp word it was--\n\n\"Who will join me?\"It was as if his question had released a spring drawn to its limit.From\ntwenty different throats in twenty different tones, but with a single\nthrobbing impulse, came the response, swift, full-throated, savage,\n\"Me!\"and in three\nminutes Superintendent Strong had secured the nucleus of his famous\nscouts.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.\"To-morrow at nine at the Barracks!\"said this grim and laconic\nSuperintendent, and was about turning away when a man came out from the\ndoor of the Royal Hotel, drawn forth by that sudden savage yell.said the Superintendent, as the man moved toward the\nsad-appearing broncho, \"I want you.\"I am with you,\" was the reply as Cameron swung on to\nhis horse.he said to his horse, touching him with\nhis heel.Ginger woke up with an indignant snort and forthwith fell into\nline with the Superintendent's big brown horse.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.The Superintendent was silent till the Barracks were gained, then,\ngiving the horses into the care of an orderly, he led Cameron into the\noffice and after they had settled themselves before the fire he began\nwithout preliminaries.\"Cameron, I am more anxious than I can say about the situation here in\nthis part of the country.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.I have been away from the center of things for\nsome months and I have lost touch.I want you to let me know just

the milk there.\"Well, he has managed to hold down his younger Chiefs so far.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.He made\nlight of the Frog Lake affair, but he was most anxious to get from\nme the fullest particulars of the Duck Lake fight.He made careful\ninquiries as to just how many Police were in the fight.I could see that\nit gave him a shock to learn that the Police had to retire.He was intensely anxious to learn also--though\nhe would not allow himself to appear so--just what the Government was\ndoing.\"<|begin_of_text|>John left the football.You see I have not\nbeen kept fully

Field\nBattery.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.A regiment from Quebec has arrived and one from Montreal and\nthere are more to follow.\"Ah, well,\" replied the Superintendent, \"I know something about the\nplan, I believe.There are three objective points, Prince Albert and\nBattleford, both of which are now closely besieged, and Edmonton,\nwhich is threatened with a great body of rebel Crees and Salteaux under\nleadership of Little Pine and Big Bear.The Police at these points can\nhardly be expected to hold out long against the overwhelming numbers\nthat are besieging them,

do us fine service.Now, about the South,\" continued the\nSuperintendent, \"what about Fort Macleod?\"\"The Superintendent there has offered himself and his whole force for\nservice in the North, but General Middleton, I understand, has asked him\nto remain where he is and keep guard in this part of the country.\"The\nCrees I do not fear so much.They are more restless and uncertain, but\nGod help

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "Indeed, you have already done\nmore than any one will ever know to hold this country safe during these\nlast months.Remember, Cameron,\" added\nthe Superintendent impressively, \"your work lies along the Sun Dance\nTrail.On no account and for no reason must you be persuaded to abandon\nthat post.I shall get into touch with General Strange to-morrow and\nshall doubtless get something to do, but if possible I should like you\nto give me a day or two for this recruiting business before you take up\nagain your patrol work along the Sun Dance.\"\"Very well, sir,\" replied Cameron quietly, trying hard to keep the\ndisappointment out of his voice.\"By the way, what are the\nPiegans doing?\"\"The Piegans,\" replied Cameron, \"are industriously stealing cattle and\nhorses.I cannot quite make out just how they can manage to get away\nwith them.Eagle Feather is apparently running the thing, but there is\nsomeone bigger than Eagle Feather in the game.An additional month or\ntwo in the guardroom would have done that gentleman no harm.\"\"Ah, has he been in the guard-room?\"Oh, I pulled him out of the Sun Dance, where I found he had been\nkilling cattle, and the Superintendent at Macleod gave him two months to\nmeditate upon his crimes.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.\"But now he is at his old habits again,\" continued Cameron.\"But his\nis not the brain planning these raids.They are cleverly done and are\ngetting serious.For instance, I must have lost a score or two of steers\nwithin the last three months.\"Either they are running them\nacross the border--though the American Police know nothing of it--or\nthey are making pemmican.\"that looks serious,\" said the Superintendent gravely.\"It makes me think that some one bigger\nthan Eagle Feather is at the bottom of all this cattle-running.Sometimes I have thought that perhaps that chap Raven has a hand in it.\"\"He has brain enough and nerve in\nplenty for any dare-devil exploit.\"\"But,\" continued Cameron in a hesitating voice, \"I cannot bring myself\nto lay this upon him.\"\"He is a cool hand and\ndesperate.\"Yes, I know he is all that, and yet--well--in this rebellion, sir,\nI believe he is with us and against them.\"In proof of this Cameron\nproceeded to relate the story of Raven's visit to the Big Horn Ranch.\"So you see,\" he concluded, \"he would not care to work in connection\nwith the Piegans just now.\"\"I don't know about that--I don't know about that,\" replied the\nSuperintendent.\"Of course he would not work against us directly, but he\nmight work for himself in this crisis.It would furnish him with a good\nopportunity, you see.\"Yes, that is true, but still--I somehow cannot help liking the chap.\"\"He is a cold-blooded\nvillain and cattle-thief, a murderer, as you know.If ever I get my hand\non him in this rumpus--Why, he's an outlaw pure and simple!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.I have\nno use for that kind of man at all.The\nSuperintendent was indignant at the suggestion that any but the severest\nmeasures should be meted out to a man of Raven's type.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.It was the\ninstinct and training of the Police officer responsible for the\nenforcement of law and order in the land moving within him.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.The conductor thought, however, that the next\nstation could yet be reached in time to meet and there pass a\nregular train coming towards him.It may have been a miscalculation\nof seconds, it may have been a difference of watches, or perhaps\nthe regular train was slightly before its time; but, however it\nhappened, as the excursion train, while running at speed, was\nrounding a reverse curve, it came full upon the regular train, which\nhad just left the station.In those days, as compared with the\npresent, the cars were but egg-shells, and the shock was terrific.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.The locomotives struck each other, and, after rearing themselves\nup for an instant, it is said, like living animals, fell to the\nground mere masses of rubbish.In any case the force of the shock\nwas sufficient to hurl both engines from the track and lay them side\nby side at right angles to, and some distance from it.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.As only the\nexcursion train happened to be running at speed, it alone had all\nthe impetus necessary for telescoping; three of its cars accordingly\nclosed in upon each other, and the children in them were crushed;\nas in the Versailles accident, two succeeding cars were driven upon\nthis mass, and then fire was set to the whole from the ruins of the\nlocomotives.It would be hard to imagine anything more thoroughly\nheart-rending, for the holocaust was of little children on a party\nof pleasure.Five cars in all were burned, and sixty-six persons\nperished; the injured numbered more than a hundred.[5]\n\n  [5] A collision very similar to that at Camphill occurred upon the\n  Erie railway at a point about 20 miles west of Port Jervis on the\n  afternoon of July 15, 1864.The train in this case consisted of\n  eighteen cars, in which were some 850 Confederate soldiers on their\n  way under guard to the prisoner's camp at Elmira.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the office.A coal train\n  consisting of 50 loaded cars from the hanch took the main line at\n  Lackawaxen.The telegraph operator there informed its conductor that\n  the track was clear, and, while rounding a sharp reversed curve,\n  the two trains came together, the one going at about twelve and the\n  other at some twenty miles an hour.Some 60 of the soldiers, besides\n  a number of train hands were killed on the spot, and 120 more were\n  seriously injured, some of them fatally.This disaster occurred in the midst of some of the most important\n  operations of the Rebellion and excited at the time hardly any\n  notice.There was a suggestive military promptness in the subsequent\n  proceedings.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bathroom.\"T. J. Ridgeway, Esq., Associate Judge of Pike County,\n  was soon on the spot, and, after consultation with Mr.Riddle [the\n  superintendent of the Erie road] and the officer in command of the\n  men, a jury was impanneled and an inquest held; after which a large\n  trench was dug by the soldiers and the railway employ\u00e9s, 76 feet\n  long, 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep, in which the bodies were at once\n  interred in boxes, hastily constructed--one being allotted to four\n  rebels, and one to each Union soldier.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the hallway.There were sixteen of the\n  latter killed.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.Of this disaster nothing could be said either in excuse or in\nextenuation; it was not only one of the worst description, but\nit was one of that description the occurrence of which is most\nfrequent.An excursion train, while running against time on a\nsingle-track road, came in collision with a regular train.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.The\nrecord is full of similar disasters, too numerous to admit of\nspecific reference.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.Primarily of course, the conductors of the\nspecial trains are as a rule in fault in such cases.He certainly\nwas at Camphill, and felt himself to be so, for the next day he\ncommitted suicide by swallowing arsenic.But in reality in these\nand in all similar cases,--both those which have happened and those\nhereafter surely destined to happen,--the full responsibility\ndoes not rest upon the unfortunate or careless subordinate;--nor\nshould the weight of punishment be visited upon him.At this late day no board of directors, nor president,\nnor superintendent has any right to operate a single track road\nwithout the systematic use of the telegraph in connection with its\ntrain movements.That the telegraph can be used to block, as it is\ntermed, double-track roads, by dividing them into sections upon no\none of which two trains can be running at the same time, is matter\nof long and daily experience.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.There is nothing new or experimental\nabout it.It is a system which has been forced on the more crowded\nlines of the world as an alternative to perennial killings.That\nin the year 1879 excursion trains should rush along single-track\nroads and hurl themselves against regular trains, just as was done\ntwenty-three years ago at Camphill, would be deemed incredible were\nnot exactly similar accidents still from time to time reported.Louis, for instance, on July 4, 1879.The\nsimple fact is that to now operate single-track roads without the\nconstant aid of the telegraph, as a means of blocking them for every\nirregular train, indicates a degree of wanton carelessness, or an\nexcess of incompetence, for which adequate provision should be made\nin the criminal law.Nothing but this appeal to the whipping-post,\nas it were, seems to produce the needed mental activity; for it is\ndifficult to realize the stupid conservatism of ordinary men when\nbrought to the consideration of something to which they are not\naccustomed.On this very point of controlling the train movement\nof single-track roads by telegraph, for instance, within a very\nrecent period the superintendent of a leading Massachusetts road\ngravely assured the railroad commissioners of that state, that he\nconsidered it a most dangerous reliance which had occasioned many\ndisasters, and that he had no doubt it would be speedily abandoned\nas a practice in favor of the old time-table and running-rules\nsystem, from which no deviations would be allowed.This opinion\nwas expressed, also, after the Revere disaster of 1871, it might\nhave been supposed, had branded into the record of the state the\nimpossibility of safely running any crowded railroad in a reliance\nupon the schedule.[6] Such men as this, however, are not accessible\nto argument or the teachings of experience, and the gentle stimulant\nof a criminal prosecution seems to be the only thing left.And yet, even with the wires in active use, collisions will\noccasionally take place.They have sometimes, indeed, even been\ncaused by the telegraph, so that railroad officials at two adjacent\nstations on the same road, having launched trains at each other\nbeyond recall, have busied themselves while waiting for tidings of\nthe inevitable collision in summoning medical assistance for those\nsure soon to be injured.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.In such cases, however, the mishap can\nalmost invariably be traced to some defect in the system under which\nthe telegraph is used;--such as a neglect to exact return messages\nto insure accuracy, or the delegating to inexperienced subordinates\nthe work which can be properly performed only by a principal.This\nwas singularly illustrated in a terrible collision which took place\nat Thorpe, between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, on the Great Eastern\nRailway in England, on the 10th of September, 1874.The line had\nin this place but a single track, and the mail train to Norwich,\nunder the rule, had to wait at a station called Brundell until the\narrival there of the evening express from Yarmouth, or until it\nreceived permission by the telegraph to proceed.On the evening of\nthe disaster the express train was somewhat behind its time, and\nthe inspector wrote a dispatch directing the mail to come forward\nwithout waiting for it.This dispatch he left in the telegraph\noffice unsigned, while he went to attend to other matters.Just then\nthe express train came along, and he at once allowed it to proceed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.Hardly was it under way when the unsigned dispatch occurred to him,\nand the unfortunate man dashed to the telegraph office only to learn\nthat the operator had forwarded it.Under the rules of the company\nno return message was required.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.A second dispatch was instantly sent\nto Brundell to stop the mail; the reply came back that the mail was\ngone.The two trains were of very equal weight, the one consisting of\nfourteen and the other of thirteen carriages.They were both drawn\nby powerful locomotives, the drivers of which had reason for putting\non an increased speed, believing, as each had cause to believe, that\nthe other was waiting for him.The night was intensely dark and\nit was raining heavily, so that, even if the brakes were applied,\nthe wheels would slide along the slippery track.Under these\ncircumstances the two trains rushed upon each other around a slight\ncurve which sufficed to conceal their head-lights.The combined\nmomentum must have amounted to little less than sixty miles an\nhour, and the shock was heard through all the neighboring village.The smoke-stack of the locomotive drawing the mail train was swept\naway as the other locomotive seemed to rush on top of it, while\nthe carriages of both trains followed until a mound of locomotives\nand shattered cars was formed which the descending torrents alone\nhindered from becoming a funeral pyre.So sudden was the collision\nthat the driver of one of the engines did not apparently have an\nopportunity to shut off the steam, and his locomotive, though forced\nfrom the track and disabled, yet remained some time in operation in\nthe midst of the wreck.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.In both trains, very fortunately, there were\na number of empty cars between the locomotives and the carriages in\nwhich the passengers were seated, and they were utterly demolished;\nbut for this fortunate circumstance the Thorpe collision might well\nhave proved the most disastrous of all railroad accidents.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.As it\nwas, the men on both the locomotives were instantly killed, together\nwith seventeen passengers, and four other passengers subsequently\ndied of their injuries; making a total of twenty-five deaths,\nbesides fifty cases of injury.It would be difficult to conceive of a more violent collision\nthan that which has just been described; and yet, as curiously\nillustrating the rapidity with which the force of the most severe\nshock is expended, it is said that two gentlemen in the last\ncarriage of one of the trains, finding it at a sudden standstill\nclose to the place to which they were going, supposed it had stopped\nfor some unimportant cause and concluded to take advantage of a\nhappy chance which left them almost at the doors of their homes.They accordingly got out and hurried away in the rain, learning\nonly the next morning of the catastrophe in which they had been\nunconscious participants.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.The collision at Thorpe occurred in September, 1874.Seven months\nlater, on the 4th of April, 1875, there was an accident similar\nto it in almost every respect, except fatality, on the Burlington\n& Missouri road in Iowa.In this case the operator at Tyrone had\ntelegraphic orders to hold the east-bound passenger express at that\npoint to meet the west-bound passenger express.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.This order he failed\nto deliver, and the train accordingly at once went on to the usual\npassing place at the next station.It was midnight and intensely\ndark, with a heavy mist in the air which at times thickened to rain.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Both of the trains approaching each other were made up in the way\nusual with through night trains on the great western lines, and\nconsisted of locomotives, baggage and smoking cars, behind which\nwere the ordinary passenger cars of the company followed by several\nheavy Pullman sleeping coaches.Those in charge of the east-bound\ntrain, knowing that it was behind time, were running it rapidly,\nso as to delay as little as possible the west-bound train, which,\nhaving received the order to pass at Tyrone was itself being run at\nspeed.Both trains were thus moving at some thirty-five miles an\nhour, when suddenly in rounding a sharp curve they came upon each\nother.Indeed so close were they that the west-bound engineer had no\ntime in which to reverse, but, jumping straight from the gangway,\nhe afterwards declared that the locomotives came together before he\nreached the ground.The engineer of the east-bound train succeeded\nboth in reversing his locomotive and in applying his airbrake, but\nafter reversal the throttle flew open.The trains came together,\ntherefore, as at Thorpe, with their momentum practically unchecked,\nand with such force that the locomotives were completely demolished,\nthe boilers of the two, though on the same line of rails, actually,\nin some way, passing each other.The baggage-cars were also", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "So admirably did\nMiller's construction serve its purpose in this case, that, while\nthe superintendent of the road, who happened to be in the rear\nsleeping car of one of the trains, merely reported that he \"felt the\nshock quite sensibly,\" passengers in the rear coaches of the other\ntrain hardly felt it at all.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.At Tyrone the wrecks of the trains caught fire from the stoves\nthrown out of the baggage cars and from the embers from the\nfire-boxes of the locomotives, but the flames were speedily\nextinguished.Of the train hands three were killed and two injured,\nbut no passenger was more than shaken or slightly bruised.This\nwas solely due to strength of car construction.Heavy as the shock\nwas,--so heavy that in the similar case at Thorpe the carriages were\ncrushed like nut-shells under it,--the resisting power was equal to\nit.The failure of appliances at one point in the operation of the\nroad was made good by their perfection at another.Similar in some of its more dramatic features to the Versailles\naccident, though originating from a wholly different cause, was the\nAbergele disaster, which at the time occupied the attention of the\nBritish public to the exclusion of everything else.It occurred\nin 1868, and to the \"Irish mail,\" perhaps the most famous train\nwhich is run in England, if, indeed, not in the world.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Leaving\nLondon shortly after 7 A.M., the Irish mail was then timed to make\nthe distance to Chester, 166 miles, in four hours and eighteen\nminutes, or at the rate of 40 miles an hour.For the next 85 miles,\ncompleting the run to Holyhead, the speed was somewhat increased,\ntwo hours and five minutes only being allowed for it.Abergele is a\npoint on the sea-coast of Wales, nearly midway between Chester and\nHolyhead.On the day of the accident, August 20, 1868, the Irish\nmail left Chester as usual.It was made up of thirteen carriages\nin all, which were occupied, as the carriages of that train usually\nwere, by a large number of persons whose names at least were widely\nknown.Among these, on this particular occasion, was the Duchess of\nAbercorn, wife of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with five\nchildren.Under the running arrangements of the London & North\nWestern road a freight, or as it is there called a goods train, left\nChester half an hour before the mail, and was placed upon the siding\nat Llanddulas, a station about a mile and a half beyond Abergele,\nto allow the mail to pass.From Abergele to Llanddulas the track\nascended by a gradient of some sixty feet to the mile.On the day of\nthe accident it chanced that certain wagons between the engine and\nthe rear end of the goods train had to be taken out to be left at\nLlanddulas, and in doing this it became necessary to separate the\ntrain and to leave five or six of the last wagons in it standing on\nthe tracks of the main line, while those which were to be left were\nbacked onto a siding.The employ\u00e9, whose duty it was, neglected to\nset the brakes on the wagons thus left standing, and consequently\nwhen the engine and the rest of the train returned for them, the\nmoment they were touched and before a coupling could be effected,\nthe jar set them in motion down the incline towards Abergele.They\nstarted so slowly that a brakeman of the train ran after them,\nfully expecting to catch and stop them, but as they went down the\ngrade they soon outstripped him and it became clear that there was\nnothing to check them until they should meet the Irish mail, then\nalmost due.It also chanced that the cars thus set in motion were\noil cars.The track of the North Western road between Abergele and Llanddulas\nruns along the sides of the picturesque Welsh hills, which rise\nup to the south, while to the north there stretches out a wide\nexpanse of sea.The mail train was skirting the hills and laboring\nup the grade at a speed of thirty miles an hour, when its engineer\nsuddenly became aware of the loose wagons coming down upon it around\nthe curve, and then but a few yards off.Seeing that they were oil\ncars he almost instinctively sprang from his locomotive, and was\nthrown down by the impetus and rolled to the side of the road-bed.Picking himself up, bruised but not seriously hurt, he saw that\nthe collision had already taken place, that the tender had ridden\ndirectly over the engine, that the colliding cars were demolished,\nand that the foremost carriages of the train were already on fire.Running quickly to the rear of the train he succeeded in uncoupling\nsix carriages and a van, which were drawn away from the rest, before\nthe flames extended to them, by an engine which most fortunately was\nfollowing the train.All the other carriages were utterly destroyed,\nand every person in them perished.The Abergele was probably the solitary instance of a railroad\naccident in which but a single survivor sustained any injury.The collision was\nnot a particularly severe one, and the engineer of the mail train\nespecially stated that at the moment it occurred the loose cars were\nstill moving so slowly that he would not have sprung from his engine\nhad he not seen that they were loaded with oil.The very instant\nthe collision took place, however, the fluid seemed to ignite and\nto flash along the train like lightning, so that it was impossible\nto approach a carriage when once it caught fire.The fact was that\nthe oil in vast quantities was spilled upon the track and ignited by\nthe fire of the locomotive, and then the impetus of the mail train\nforced all of its leading carriages into the dense mass of smoke and\nflame.All those who were present concurred in positively stating\nthat not a cry, nor a moan, nor a sound of any description was heard\nfrom the burning carriages, nor did any one in them apparently make\nan effort to escape.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the office.The most graphic description of this extraordinary and terrible\ncatastrophe was that given by the Marquis of Hamilton, the eldest\nson of the Duke of Abercorn whose wife and family, fortunately\nfor themselves, occupied one of those rear carriages which were\nunshackled and saved.In this account the Marquis of Hamilton\nsaid:--\"We were startled by a collision and a shock which, though\nnot very severe, were sufficient to throw every one against his\nopposite neighbor.I immediately jumped out of the carriage,\nwhen a fearful sight met my view.Already the whole of the three\npassengers' carriages in front of ours, the vans, and the engine\nwere enveloped in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising fully\ntwenty feet high, and spreading out in every direction.No words can convey the instantaneous nature\nof the explosion and conflagration.I had actually got out almost\nbefore the shock of the collision was over, and this was the\nspectacle which already presented itself.Not a sound, not a scream,\nnot a struggle to escape, not a movement of any sort was apparent\nin the doomed carriages.It was as though an electric flash had\nat once paralyzed and stricken every one of their occupants.So\ncomplete was the absence of any presence of living or struggling\nlife in them that as soon as the passengers from the other parts\nof the train were in some degree recovered from their first shock\nand consternation, it was imagined that the burning carriages were\ndestitute of passengers; a hope soon changed into feelings of horror\nwhen their contents of charred and mutilated remains were discovered\nan hour afterward.From the extent, however, of the flames, the\nsuddenness of the conflagration, and the absence of any power to\nextricate themselves, no human aid would have been of any assistance\nto the sufferers, who, in all probability, were instantaneously\nsuffocated by the black and fetid smoke peculiar to paraffine, which\nrose in volumes around the spreading flames.\"<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk.Though the collision took place before one o'clock, in spite\nof the efforts of a large gang of men who were kept throwing\nwater on the tracks, the perfect sea of flame which covered the\nline for a distance of some forty or fifty yards could not be\nextinguished until nearly eight o'clock in the evening; for the\npetroleum had flowed down into the ballasting of the road, and the\nrails themselves were red-hot.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.It was therefore small occasion\nfor surprise that, when the fire was at last gotten under, the\nremains of those who lost their lives were in some cases wholly\nundistinguishable, and in others almost so.Among the thirty-three\nvictims of the disaster the body of no single one retained any\ntraces of individuality; the faces of all were wholly destroyed,\nand in no case were there found feet, or legs, or anything at all\napproaching to a perfect head.Ten corpses were finally identified\nas those of males, and thirteen as those of females, while the sex\nof ten others could not be determined.The body of one passenger,\nLord Farnham, was identified by the crest on his watch; and, indeed,\nno better evidence of the wealth and social position of the victims\nof this accident could have been asked for than the collection of\narticles found on its site.It included diamonds of great size\nand singular brilliancy; rubies, opals, emeralds, gold tops of\nsmelling-bottles, twenty-four watches, of which but two or three\nwere not gold, chains, clasps of bags, and very many bundles of\nkeys.Of these the diamonds alone had successfully resisted the\nintense heat of the flame; the settings were nearly all destroyed.Of the causes of this accident little need or can be said.No human\nappliances, no more ingenious brakes or increased strength of\nconstruction, could have averted it or warded off its consequences\nonce it was inevitable.It was occasioned primarily by two things,\nthe most dangerous and the most difficult to reach of all the\nmany sources of danger against which those managing railroads\nhave unsleepingly to contend:--a somewhat defective discipline,\naggravated by a little not unnatural carelessness.The rule of\nthe company was specific that all the wagons of every goods train\nshould be out of the way and the track clear at least ten minutes\nbefore a passenger train was due; but in this case shunting was\ngoing actively on when the Irish-mail was within a mile and a half.A careless brakeman then forgot for once that he was leaving his\nwagons close to the head of an incline; a blow in coupling, a little\nheavier perhaps than usual, sufficed to set them in motion; and they\nhappened to be loaded with oil.A catastrophe strikingly similar to that at Abergele befell an\nexpress train on the Hudson River railroad, upon the night of the\n6th of February, 1871.The weather for a number of days preceding\nthe accident had been unusually cold, and it is to the suffering\nof employ\u00e9s incident to exposure, and the consequent neglect of\nprecautions on their part, that accidents are peculiarly due.On\nthis night a freight train was going south, all those in charge of\nwhich were sheltering themselves during a steady run in the caboose\ncar at its rear end.Suddenly, when near a bridge over Wappinger's\nCreek, not far from New Hamburg, they discovered that a car in the\ncentre of the train was off the track.The train was finally stopped\non the bridge, but in stopping it other cars were also derailed,\nand one of these, bearing on it two large oil tanks, finally rested\nobliquely across the bridge with one end projecting over the up\ntrack.Hardly had the disabled train been brought to a stand-still,\nwhen, before signal lanterns could in the confusion incident to the\ndisaster be sent out, the Pacific express from New York, which was\na little behind its time, came rapidly along.As it approached the\nbridge, its engineer saw a red lantern swung, and instantly gave the\nsignal to apply the brakes.It was too late to avoid the collision;\nbut what ensued had in it, so far as the engineer was concerned,\nan element of the heroic, which his companion, the fireman of the\nengine, afterwards described on the witness stand with a directness\nand simplicity of language which exceeded all art.The engineer's\nname was Simmons, and he was familiarly known among his companions\nas \"Doc.\"His fireman, Nicholas Tallon, also saw the red light swung\non the bridge, and called out to him that the draw was open.In\nreply Simmons told him to spring the patent brake, which he did,\nand by this time they were alongside of the locomotive of the\ndisabled train and running with a somewhat slackened speed.Tallon\nhad now got out upon the step of the locomotive, preparatory to\nspringing off, and turning asked his companion if he also proposed\nto do the same:--\"'Doc' looked around at me but made no reply, and\nthen looked ahead again, watching his business; then I jumped and\nrolled down on the ice in the creek; the next I knew I heard the\ncrash and saw the fire and smoke.\"The next seen of \"Doc\" Simmons,\nhe was dragged up days afterwards from under his locomotive at the\nbottom of the river.He went out\nof the world and of the sight of men with his hand on the lever,\nmaking no reply to the suggestion that he should leave his post, but\n\"looking ahead and watching his business.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.Dante himself could not have imagined a greater complication of\nhorrors than then ensued: liquid fire and solid frost combined to\nmake the work of destruction perfect.The shock of the collision\nbroke in pieces the oil car, igniting its contents and flinging them\nabout in every direction.In an instant bridge, river, locomotive,\ncars, and the glittering surface of the ice were wrapped in a sheet\nof flame.At the same time the strain proved too severe for the\ntrestlework, which gave way, precipitating the locomotive, tender,\nbaggage cars, and one passenger car onto the ice, through which they\ninstantly crushed and sank deep out of sight beneath the water.Of the remaining seven cars of the passenger train, two, besides\nseveral of the freight train, were destroyed by fire, and shortly,\nas the supports of the remaining portions of the bridge burned away,\nthe superstructure fell on the half-submerged cars in the water and\nburied them from view.Twenty-one persons lost their lives in this disaster, and a large\nnumber of others were injured; but the loss of life, it will be\nnoticed, was only two-thirds of that at Abergele.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.The New Hamburg\ncatastrophe also differed from that at Abergele in that, under\nits particular circumstances, it was far more preventable, and,\nindeed, with the appliances since brought into use it would surely\nbe avoided.The modern train-brake had, however, not then been\nperfected, so that even the hundred rods at which the signal was\nseen did not afford a sufficient space in which to stop the train.It is difficult to see how on double track roads, where the\noccurrence of an accident on one line of tracks is always liable to\ninstantly \"foul\" the other line, it is possible to guard against\ncontingencies like that which occurred at New Hamburg.At the time,\nas is usual in such cases, the public indignation expended itself\nin vague denunciation of the Hudson River Railroad Company, because\nthe disaster happened to take place upon a bridge in which there was\na draw to permit the passage of vessels.There seemed to be a vague\nbut very general impression that draw-bridges were dangerous things,\nand, because other accidents due to different causes had happened\nupon them, that the occurrence of this accident, from whatever\ncause, was in itself sufficient evidence of gross carelessness.The\nfact was that not even the clumsy Connecticut rule, which compels\nthe stopping of all trains before entering on any draw-bridge,\nwould have sufficed to avert the New Hamburg disaster, for the\nriver was then frozen and the draw was not in use, so that for the\ntime being the bridge was an ordinary bridge; and not even in the\nfrenzy of crude suggestions which invariably succeeds each new\naccident was any one ever found ignorant enough to suggest the\nstopping of all trains before entering upon every bridge, which, as\nrailroads generally follow water-courses, would not infrequently\nnecessitate an average of one stop to every thousand feet or so.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the football.", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "Only incidentally did the bridge at New Hamburg have anything to\ndo with the disaster there, the essence of which lay in the sudden\nderailment of an oil car immediately in front of a passenger train\nrunning in the opposite direction and on the other track.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bedroom.Of course,\nif the derailment had occurred long enough before the passenger\ntrain came up to allow the proper signals to be given, and this\nprecaution had been neglected, then the disaster would have been\ndue, not to the original cause, but to the defective discipline\nof the employ\u00e9s.Such does not appear to have been the case at\nNew Hamburg, nor was that disaster by any means the first due to\nderailment and the throwing of cars from one track in front of a\ntrain passing upon the other;--nor will it be the last.Indeed, an\naccident hardly less destructive, arising from that very cause, had\noccurred only eight months previous in England, and resulted in\neighteen deaths and more than fifty cases of injury.A goods train made up of a locomotive and twenty-nine wagons was\nrunning at a speed of some twenty miles an hour on the Great\nNorthern road, between Newark and Claypole, about one hundred miles\nfrom London, when the forward axle under one of the wagons broke.As\na result of the derailment which ensued the train became divided,\nand presently the disabled car was driven by the pressure behind it\nout of its course and over the interval, so that it finally rested\npartly across the other track.At just this moment an excursion\ntrain from London, made up of twenty-three carriages and containing\nsome three hundred and forty passengers, came along at a speed of\nabout thirty-five miles an hour.It was quite dark, and the engineer\nof the freight train waved his arm as a signal of danger; one of\nthe guards, also, showed a red light with his hand lantern, but his\naction either was not seen or was misunderstood, for without any\nreduction of speed being made the engine of the excursion train\nplunged headlong into the disabled goods wagon.The collision was\nso violent as to turn the engine aside off the track and cause it\nto strike the stone pier of a bridge near by, by which it was flung\ncompletely around and then driven up the <DW72> of the cutting, where\nit toppled over like a rearing horse and fell back into the roadway.The tender likewise was overturned; but not so the carriages.They\nrushed along holding to the track, and the side of each as it passed\nwas ripped and torn by the projecting end of the goods wagon.Of the twenty-three carriages and vans in the train scarcely one\nescaped damage, while the more forward ones were in several cases\nlifted one on top of the other or forced partly up the <DW72> of\nthe cutting, whence they fell back again, crushing the passengers\nbeneath them.This accident occurred on the 21st of June, 1870; it was very\nthoroughly investigated by Captain Tyler on behalf of the Board of\nTrade, with the apparent conclusion that it was one which could\nhardly have been guarded against.The freight cars, the broken\naxle of which occasioned the disaster, did not belong to the Great\nNorthern company, and the wheels of the train had been properly\nexamined by viewing and tapping at the several stopping-places; the\nflaw which led to the fracture was, however, of such a nature that\nit could have been detected only by the removal of the wheel.It did\nnot appear that the employ\u00e9s of the company had been guilty of any\nnegligence; and it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the\naccident was due to one of those defects to which the results of\neven the most perfect human workmanship must ever remain liable, and\nthis had revealed itself under exactly those conditions which must\ninvolve the most disastrous consequences.The English accident did, however, establish one thing, if nothing\nelse; it showed the immeasurable superiority of the system of\ninvestigation pursued in the case of railroad accidents in England\nover that pursued in this country.There a trained expert after\nthe occurrence of each disaster visits the spot and sifts the\naffair to the very bottom, locating responsibility and pointing out\ndistinctly the measures necessary to guard against its repetition.Here the case ordinarily goes to a coroner's jury, the findings of\nwhich as a rule admirably sustain the ancient reputation of that\naugust tribunal.It is absolutely sad to follow the course of these\ninvestigations, they are conducted with such an entire disregard of\nmethod and lead to such inadequate conclusions.Indeed, how could it\nbe otherwise?--The same man never investigates two accidents, and,\nfor the one investigation he does make, he is competent only in his\nown esteem.Take the New Hamburgh accident as an example.Rarely has any\ncatastrophe merited a more careful investigation, and few\nindeed have ever called forth more ill-considered criticism or\ncrude suggestions.Almost nothing of interest respecting it was\nelicited at the inquest, and now no reliable criticism can be\nventured upon it.(_Aside._) I really am\ncured!Darling, you mustn't cry any more.No, papa, I won't, for I like him extremely now.He's so\nhandsome, and so amiable!Why, papa, you _asked_ him to marry me, Jane says.marry my darling to a\ndeaf man?O papa, you are cured: perhaps he can be cured in the same\nway.Not another word, my love, about that horrible deaf fellow!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.I\nasked him to dine here to-day, like an old ass;

Wittengoff were at his side.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.Profound silence\npervaded the Assembly.All were touched by the King's dignity and the\ncomposure of his looks under so great a reverse of fortune.By nature he\nhad been formed rather to endure calamity with patience than to contend\nagainst it with energy.The approach of death could not disturb his\nserenity.\"Louis, you may be seated,\" said Barere.\"Answer the questions that shall\nbe put to you.\"The King seated himself and listened to the reading of\nthe 'acte enonciatif', article by article.All the faults of the Court\nwere there enumerated and imputed to Louis XVI.He was charged\nwith the interruption of the sittings of the 20th of June, 1789, with the\nBed of Justice held on the 23d of the same month, the aristocratic\nconspiracy thwarted by the insurrection of the 14th of July, the\nentertainment of the Life Guards, the insults offered to the national\ncockade, the refusal to sanction the Declaration of Rights, as well as\nseveral constitutional articles; lastly, all the facts which indicated a\nnew conspiracy in October, and which were followed by the scenes of the\n5th and 6th; the speeches of reconciliation which had succeeded all these\nscenes, and which promised a change that was not sincere; the false oath\ntaken at the Federation of the 14th of July; the secret practices of Talon\nand Mirabeau to effect a counter-revolution; the money spent in bribing a\ngreat number of deputies; the assemblage of the \"knights of the dagger\" on\nthe 28th of February, 1791; the flight to Varennes; the fusilade of the\nChamp de Mars; the silence observed respecting the Treaty of Pilnitz; the\ndelay in the promulgation of the decree which incorporated Avignon with\nFrance; the commotions at Nimes, Montauban, Mende, and Jales; the\ncontinuance of their pay to the emigrant Life Guards and to the disbanded\nConstitutional Guard; the insufficiency of the armies assembled on the\nfrontiers; the refusal to sanction the decree for the camp of twenty\nthousand men; the disarming of the fortresses; the organisation of secret\nsocieties in the interior of Paris; the review of the Swiss and the\ngarrison of the palace on the 10th August; the summoning the Mayor to the\nTuileries; and lastly, the effusion of blood which had resulted from these\nmilitary dispositions.After each article the President paused, and said,\n\"What have you to answer?\"The King, in a firm voice, denied some of the\nfacts, imputed others to his ministers, and always appealed to the\nconstitution, from which he declared he had never deviated.His answers\nwere very temperate, but on the charge, \"You spilt the blood of the people\non the 10th of August,\" he exclaimed, with emphasis, \"No, monsieur, no; it\nwas not I.\"All the papers on which the act of accusation was founded were then shown\nto the King, and he disavowed some of them and disputed the existence of\nthe iron chest; this produced a bad impression, and was worse than\nuseless, as the fact had been proved.[A secret closet which the King had directed to be constructed in a wall\nin the Tuileries.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.The door was of iron, whence it was afterwards known by\nthe name of the iron chest.Throughout the examination the King showed great presence of mind.He was\ncareful in his answers never to

and as he had no bed, she gave him hers, and sat up all\nthe night in such deep affliction that we were afraid to leave her; but\nshe compelled my aunt and me to go to bed.Next day she again asked to\nsee my father, and to read the newspapers, that she might learn the course\nof the trial.She entreated that if she was to be denied this indulgence,\nhis children, at least, might see him.Her requests were referred to the\nCommune.The newspapers were refused; but my brother and I were to be\nallowed to see my father on condition of being entirely separated from my\nmother.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.My father replied that, great as his happiness was in seeing his\nchildren, the important business which then occupied him would not allow\nof his attending altogether to his son, and that his daughter could not\nleave her mother.\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the garden.[During their last interview Madame Elisabeth had given Clery one of her\nhandkerchiefs, saying, \"You shall keep it so long as my brother continues\nwell;

the latter complied at once with the King's request;\nand while the Assembly was considering whom to, nominate in Target's\nplace, the President received a letter from the venerable Malesherbes,\n\n[Christian Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, an eminent French\nstatesman, son of the Chancellor of France, was born at Paris in 1721.In\n1750 he succeeded his father as President of the Court of Aids, and was\nalso made superintendent of the press.On the banishment of the\nParliaments and the suppression of the Court of Aids, Malesherbes was\nexiled to his country-seat.In 1775 he was appointed Minister of State.On the decree of the Convention for the King's trial, he emerged from his\nretreat to become the voluntary advocate of his sovereign.Malesherbes\nwas guillotined in 1794, and almost his whole family were extirpated by\ntheir merciless persecutors.]then seventy years old, and \"the most respected magistrate in France,\" in\nthe course of which he said: \"I have been twice called to be counsel for\nhim who was my master, in times when that duty was coveted by every one.I\nowe him the same service now that it is a duty which many people deem\ndangerous.If I knew any possible means of acquainting him with my\ndesires, I should not take the liberty of addressing myself to you.\"Other\ncitizens made similar proposals, but the King, being made acquainted with\nthem by a deputation from the Commune, while expressing his gratitude for\nall the offers, accepted only that of Malesherbes.[The Citoyenne Olympia Degonges, calling herself a free and loyal\nRepublican without spot or blame, and declaring that the cold and selfish\ncruelty of Target had inflamed her heroism and roused her sensibility,\nasked permission to assist M, de Malesherbes in defending the King.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.The\nAssembly passed to the order of the day on this request.--BERTRAND DE\nMOLLEVILLE, \"Annals,\" edit.1802, vol, viii., p.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.On 14th December M.

but all will\nbe useless.No matter; I shall gain\nmy cause if I leave an unspotted memory behind me.'\"]<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.Another deputation brought the King the Act of Accusation and the\ndocuments relating to it, numbering more than a hundred, and taking from\nfour o'clock till midnight to read.During this long process the King had\nrefreshments served to the deputies, taking nothing himself till they had\nleft, but considerately reproving Clery for not having supped.From the\n14th to the 26th December the King saw his counsel and their colleague M.\nde Size every day.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the office.At this time a means of communication between the\nroyal family and the King was devised: a man named Turgi, who had been in\nthe royal kitchen, and who contrived to obtain employment in the Temple,\nwhen conveying the meals of the royal family to their apartments, or\narticles he had purchased for them, managed to give Madame Elisabeth news\nof the King.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.Next day, the Princess, when Turgi was removing the dinner,\nslipped into his hand a bit of paper on which she had pricked with a pin a\nrequest for a word from her brother's own hand.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the kitchen.Turgi gave this paper to\nClery, who conveyed it to the King the same evening; and he, being allowed\nwriting materials while preparing his defence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a\nshort note.An answer was conveyed in a ball of cotton, which Turgi threw\nunder Clery's bed while passing the door of his room.Letters were also\npassed between the Princess's room and that of Clery, who lodged beneath\nher, by means of a string let down and drawn up at night.This\ncommunication with his family was a great comfort to the King, who,\nnevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful servant.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.\"Take care,\" he\nwould say kindly, \"you expose yourself too much.\"[The King's natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the Temple.His own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy with the\nsmaller troubles of others.A servant in the Temple named Marchand, the\nfather of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs, --his wages for two\nmonths.The King observed his distress, asked its cause, and gave Clery\nthe amount to be handed to Marchand, with a caution not to speak of it to\nany one, and, above all, not to thank the King, lest it should injure him\nwith his employers.]During his separation from his family the King refused to go into the\ngarden.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.When it was proposed to him he said, \"I cannot make up my mind to\ngo out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with my\nfamily.\"<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful reflections.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.He talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised them by his\nvaried and practical knowledge of their trades, and his interest in their\ndomestic affairs.On the 19th December the King's breakfast was served as\nusual; but, being a fast-day, he refused to take anything.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the kitchen.At dinner-time\nthe King said to Clery, \"Fourteen years ago you were up earlier than you\nwere to-day; it is the day my daughter was born--today, her birthday,\" he\nrepeated, with tears, \"and to be prevented from seeing her!\"Madame\nRoyale had wished for a calendar; the King ordered Clery to buy her the\n\"Almanac of the Republic,\" which had replaced the \"Court Almanac,\" and ran\nthrough it, marking with a pencil many names.\"On Christmas Day,\" Says Clery, \"the King wrote his will.\"[Madame Royale says: \"On the 26th December, St.Stephen's Day, my father\nmade his will, because he expected to be assassinated that day on his way\nto the bar of the Convention.He went thither, nevertheless, with his\nusual calmness.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.On the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the\nConvention.<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his\ndefence.The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too\nrhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.[When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King, the\nevening before it was delivered to the Assembly, \"I have to request of\nyou,\" he said, \"to make a painful sacrifice; strike out of your pleading\nthe peroration.It is enough for me to appear before such judges, and\nshow my entire innocence; I will not move their feelings.--\"LACRETELLE.]At half-past nine in the morning the whole armed force was in motion to\nconduct him from the Temple to the Feuillans, with the same precautions\nand in the same order as had been observed on the former occasion.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.Riding\nin the carriage of the Mayor, he conversed, on the way, with the same\ncomposure as usual, and talked of Seneca, of Livy, of the hospitals.Arrived at the Feuillans, he showed great anxiety for his defenders; he\nseated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure\nthe benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine their\nfaces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the pleading\nof M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with Tronchet and\nMalesherbes.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bedroom.The Assembly received his defence in sullen silence, but\nwithout any tokens of disapprobation.Being afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the King\nshowed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the long\ndefence.While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his companions\nwith the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.No sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent\ntumult arose there.Others,\ncomplaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,\ndemanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the\naccused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.Lanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an\nindignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to\nrepress.He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his\npresence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether.He\nexclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the Assembly\nought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment on Louis\nXVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the Assembly in\nparticular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as a political\nbody, it could do no more than take measures of safety against the\nci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of justice it was\noverstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the vanquished to be\ntried by the conquerors, since most of the present members had declared\nthemselves the conspirators of the 10th of August.At the word\n\"conspirators\" a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.Lanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word \"conspirators,\" saying that\nhe meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of August\nwas a glorious conspiracy.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.He concluded by declaring that he would rather\ndie a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws, even the most\nexecrable of tyrants.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the milk.A great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually\nincreased.The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled\ntogether, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.After a\ntempest of an hour's duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the\nAssembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on the\ntrial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should be\ncontinued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence should be\npassed.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the kitchen.The discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a\nconstant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.Vergniaud at\nlength ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary\neagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments\nby the lips of their greatest orator.The speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.Robespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.Vergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which\nwavered between the two parties.Several members were successively heard,\nfor and against the appeal to the people.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Brissot, Gensonne, Petion,\nsupported it in their turn.One speaker at length had a decisive\ninfluence on the question.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and\nevasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.He spoke at\ngreat length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings--of facts, of\nlaws, and of policy--and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted\nspecious reasons for", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>office"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.The\ndiscussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the\ncontinual repetition of the same facts and arguments.It was therefore\ndeclared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh\nadjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a\ndecree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the\nvote.Meantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his\noutward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.On the\nmorning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the\ncommissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen a\ncopy of the King's printed defence, asked for something which had belonged\nto him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck handkerchief\nand gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another municipal, who had made\nthe same request.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.\"On January 1st,\" says Clery, \"I approached the King's\nbed and asked permission to offer him my warmest prayers for the end of\nhis misfortunes.'I accept your good wishes with affection,' he replied,\nextending his hand to me.As soon as he had risen, he requested a\nmunicipal to go and inquire for his family, and present them his good\nwishes for the new year.The officers were moved by the tone in which\nthese words, so heartrending considering the position of the King, were\npronounced.The correspondence between their Majesties went on\nconstantly.The King being informed that Madame Royale was ill, was very\nuneasy for some days.The Queen, after begging earnestly, obtained\npermission for M. Brunnier, the medical attendant of the royal children,\nto come to the Temple.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.The nearer the moment which was to decide the King's fate approached, the\ngreater became the agitation in, Paris.\"A report was circulated that the\natrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners and\ntheir relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would\nsnatch them from destruction.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that\nconspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.from\npunishment, and to restore royalty.Their anger, excited by delays and\nobstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus\nalarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.On the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,\nbeing the final judgment of Louis XVI.\"The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial,\" says Hazlitt,\n\"lasted seventy-two hours.It might naturally be supposed that silence,\nrestraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.On the\ncontrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the most\ngrotesque confusion.The farther end of the hall was converted into\nboxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,\nliqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,\nas on ordinary occasions.Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side\nopened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc\nd'Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation\nwas strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant 'Ha, ha's!'of\nthe mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,\nwhenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of\ndeath.The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole\ntrial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as\nin a tavern.\"Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring\ncoffee-houses.Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every\ncountenance.The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by\nthe pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only the\nword--Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to dinner\nbefore they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in order to\ncount the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only waking up to\ngive their sentence,--all this had the appearance rather of a hideous\ndream than of a reality.\"The Duc d'Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his\nKing and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than\ndeath itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:\n\"Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have\nresisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for\ndeath!\"Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was\nto the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously\nselfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the\nagitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single\nvote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.The President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny was\nproclaimed as follows\n\n\n     Against an appeal to the people........... 480\n     For an appeal to the people............... 283\n\n     Majority for final judgment............... 197\n\n\nThe President having announced that he was about to declare the result of\nthe scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the following\ndeclaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319 were for\nimprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment, eight for a\nsuspension of the execution of the sentence of death until after the\nexpulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for not putting\nhim to death until the French territory was invaded by any foreign power,\nand one was for a sentence of death, but with power of commutation of the\npunishment.After this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his\nvoice, said: \"In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that\nthe punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet\nis DEATH!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bathroom.Previous to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the\npart of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish\nMinister relative to that sentence.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.The Convention, however, refused to\nhear it.[It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was forwarded\nby the English Government.]M. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the\nTemple at nine o'clock on the morning of the 17th?.During the calling of the votes\nhe asked M. de Malesherbes, \"Have you not met near the Temple the White\nLady?\"\"Do you not know,\" resumed the\nKing with a smile, \"that when a prince of our house is about to die, a\nfemale dressed in white is seen wandering about the palace?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.My friends,\"\nadded he to his defenders, \"I am about to depart before you for the land\nof the just, but there, at least, we shall be reunited.\"In fact, his\nMajesty's only apprehension seemed to be for his family.--ALISON.]\"All is lost,\" he said to Clery.The King, who\nsaw him arrive, rose to receive him.[When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of the\nvote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and absorbed\nin a deep reverie.Without inquiring concerning his fate, he said: \"For\ntwo hours I have been considering whether, during my whole reign, I have\nvoluntarily given any cause of complaint to my subjects; and with perfect\nsincerity I declare that I deserve no reproach at their hands, and that I\nhave never formed a wish but for their happiness.\"M. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.The King\nraised him up and affectionately embraced him.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.When he could control his\nvoice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to\ndeath; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only\naffected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.On the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI.was awaiting\nhis advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.He stopped\nwith dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved: Garat then\ntold him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate to him the\ndecrees of the Convention.Grouvelle, secretary of the Executive Council,\nread them to him.guilty of treason against\nthe general safety of the State; the second condemned him to death; the\nthird rejected any appeal to the people; and the fourth and last ordered\nhis execution in twenty-four hours.Louis, looking calmly round, took the\npaper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a letter, in which he demanded from\nthe Convention three days to prepare for death, a confessor to assist him\nin his last moments, liberty to see his family, and permission for them to\nleave France.Garat took the letter, promising to submit it immediately\nto the Convention.then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his\ndinner, and ate as usual.There were no knives on the table, and his\nattendants refused to let him have any.\"Do they think me so cowardly,\"\nhe exclaimed, \"as to lay violent hands on myself?I am innocent, and I am\nnot afraid to die.\"The Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he\nhad made.Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom\nLouis XVI.had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.M.\nEdgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have\nthrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed\ntears of emotion.He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions\nconcerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the\nArchbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died\nfaithfully attached to his communion.--The clock having struck eight, he\nrose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that\nhe was going to see his family.The municipal officers, unwilling to lose\nsight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he should\nsee them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which they\ncould watch all his motions without hearing what he said.At half-past\neight the door opened.The Queen, holding the Dauphin by the hand, Madame\nElisabeth, and Madame Royale rushed sobbing into the arms of Louis XVI.The door was closed, and the municipal officers, Clery, and M. Edgeworth\nplaced themselves behind it.During the first moments, it was but a scene\nof confusion and despair.Cries and lamentations prevented those who were\non the watch from distinguishing anything.At length the conversation\nbecame more calm, and the Princesses, still holding the King clasped in\ntheir arms, spoke with him in a low tone.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.\"He related his trial to my\nmother,\" says Madame Royale, \"apologising for the wretches who had\ncondemned him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.He told her that he would not consent to any attempt to\nsave him, which might excite disturbance in the country.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.He then gave my\nbrother some religious advice, and desired him, above all, to forgive\nthose who caused his death; and he gave us his blessing.My mother was\nvery desirous that the whole family should pass the night with my father,\nbut he opposed this, observing to her that he much needed some hours of\nrepose and quiet.\"After a long conversation, interrupted by silence and\ngrief, the King put an end to the painful meeting, agreeing to see his\nfamily again at eight the next morning.\"Yes, yes,\" sorrowfully replied the\nKing.[\"But when we were gone,\" says his daughter, \"he requested that we might\nnot be permitted to return, as our presence afflicted him too much.\"]At this moment the Queen held him by one arm, Madame Elisabeth by the\nother, while Madame Royale clasped him round the waist, and the Dauphin\nstood before him, with one hand in that of his mother.At the moment of\nretiring Madame Royale fainted; she was carried away, and the King\nreturned to M. Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview.The\nKing retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon a\nbed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.Next morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,\nand dressed with great calmness.He congratulated himself on having\nrecovered his strength by sleep.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.Clery kindled a fire,, and moved a chest\nof drawers, out of which he formed an altar.M. Edgeworth put on his\npontifical robes, and began to celebrate mass.Clery waited on him, and\nthe King listened, kneeling with the greatest devotion.He then received\nthe communion from the hands of M. Edgeworth, and after mass rose with new\nvigour, and awaited with composure the moment for going to the scaffold.He asked for scissors that Clery might cut his hair; but the Commune\nrefused to trust him with a pair.At this moment the drums were beating in the capital.All who belonged to\nthe armed sections repaired to their company with complete submission.It\nwas reported that four or five hundred devoted men, were to make a dash\nupon the carriage, and rescue the King.<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.The Convention, the Commune, the\nExecutive Council, and the Jacobins were sitting.in the\nmorning, Santerre, with a deputation from the Commune, the department, and\nthe criminal tribunal, repaired to the Temple.Louis XVI., on hearing\nthem arrive, rose and prepared to depart.He desired Clery to transmit\nhis last farewell to his wife, his sister, and his children; he gave him a\nsealed packet, hair, and various trinkets, with directions to deliver\nthese articles to them.[In the course of the morning the King said to me: \"You will give this\nseal to my son and this ring to the Queen, and assure her that it is with\npain I part with it.This little packet contains the hair of all my\nfamily; you will give her that, too.Tell the Queen, my dear sister, and\nmy children, that, although I promised to see them again this morning, I\nhave resolved to spare them the pang of so cruel a separation.Tell them\nhow much it costs me to go away without receiving their embraces once\nmore!\"He wiped away some tears, and then added, in the most mournful\naccents, \"I charge you to bear them my last farewell.\"--CLERY.]He then clasped his hand and thanked him for his services.After this he\naddressed himself to one of the municipal officers, requesting him to\ntransmit his last will to the Commune.This officer, who had formerly\nbeen a priest, and was named Jacques Roux, brutally replied that his\nbusiness was to conduct him to execution, and not to perform his\ncommissions.Another person took charge of it, and Louis, turning towards\nthe party, gave with firmness the signal for starting.Officers of gendarmerie were placed on the front seat of the carriage.The\nKing and M. Edgeworth occupied the back.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.During the ride, which was\nrather long, the King read in M. Edgeworth's breviary the prayers for\npersons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his\npiety and tranquil resignation.<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst\nuniversal silence.At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had\nbeen left vacant about the scaffold.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.Around this space were planted\ncannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the\nscaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and\nmisfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks\nof the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "Louis XVI., rising briskly,\nstepped out into the Place.Three executioners came up; he refused their\nassistance, and took off his clothes himself.But, perceiving that they\nwere going to bind his hands, he made a movement of indignation, and\nseemed ready to resist.M. Edgeworth gave him a last look, and said,\n\"Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God who is about to be\nyour reward.\"At these words the King suffered himself to be bound and\nconducted to the scaffold.All at once Louis hurriedly advanced to\naddress the people.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.\"Frenchmen,\" said he, in a firm voice, \"I die\ninnocent of the crimes which are imputed to me; I forgive the authors of\nmy death, and I pray that my blood may not fall upon France.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the football there.He would\nhave continued, but the drums were instantly ordered to beat: their\nrolling drowned his voice; the executioners laid hold of him, and M.\nEdgeworth took his leave in these memorable words: \"Son of Saint Louis,\nascend to heaven!\"As soon as the blood flowed, furious wretches dipped\ntheir pikes and handkerchiefs in it, then dispersed throughout Paris,\nshouting \"Vive la Republique!and even went to the\ngates of the Temple to display brutal and factious joy.[The body of Louis was, immediately after the execution, removed to the\nancient cemetery of the Madeleine.Large quantities of quicklime were\nthrown into the grave, which occasioned so rapid a decomposition that,\nwhen his remains were sought for in 1816, it was with difficulty any part\ncould be recovered.Over the spot where he was interred Napoleon\ncommenced the splendid Temple of Glory, after the battle of Jena; and the\nsuperb edifice was completed by the Bourbons, and now forms the Church of\nthe Madeleine, the most beautiful structure in Paris.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,\nsir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir.\"This of course\nimplied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,\ndumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who\nwere able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been\nhalf as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in\ngeneral as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little\ndisease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their\ntreatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the\nmedicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who\nmost needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,\nand rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken\nno notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for\nbeing dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their\nadvocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because\nsuch men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little\nblack baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one\nday incurred his displeasure: \"Bo'swain's mate,\" cried he, \"take my boy\nforward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a\nrope's-ending; and,\" turning to me, \"Doctor, you'll go and attend my\nboy's flogging.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.With a face like crimson I rushed\nbelow to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for\nonce; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my\ntreatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the\nassistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been\ntaken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the football.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel\ninjustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a\ncircular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall\nhave a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he\ndoes not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant\n(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he\nwill then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no\nspare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a\nsea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,\noverboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build\nan additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the\nadmiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the garden.Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the\nrespect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the\nbest English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part\ngentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that\n\n  \"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,\n  A man's man for a' that;\"\n\nand I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a\ngentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are\nsome young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be\nsure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but\nknowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are\nnot dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or\non the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,\nI question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering\nthe service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is\nagreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can\nonly be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that\nbeautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as\nspeak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is \"shop,\" or rather\n\"ship.\"There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the\ndrama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and\nenlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but\ntoo seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former\nship-mates, and the old, old, stale \"good things,\"--these are more\nfashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such\nconversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they\ngrew.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and\nperfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of\ntheir time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I\nfear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which\nI prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if\nthe medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take\naway the \"combat,\" and leave the \"ant\"--ant-officers, as they do the\nwork of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their\ncombatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory\nshaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it\nmay seem.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra put down the milk.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless\na true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to\nprefer the army to the navy.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bathroom.\"Mere dandies,\" the reader may say, \"whom\nthis grievance would affect;\" but there is many a good man a dandy, and\nno one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal\nappearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his\nface by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--\nornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as\nthe blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,\npoints out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even\nthe Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What\nwould the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Didn't\nthe Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming\nmoustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance\nto the smallest and most effeminate?<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.Does it not even beget a certain\namount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor\nmake of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony\nTrollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed\nmoustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to\ncall on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and\nEnglish ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--\nadmitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands\nare the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in\nfavour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose\nthe best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy\nshould keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,\nsmooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable\nto wear the moustache in good society.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.Those were the days of\ncabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are\npast and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge\nunder the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative\npeace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the\ncutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,\nused, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell\nin with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the\ncommander gave the order, \"All hands to shave,\" never was such a\nhurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to\nbe lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his\nface with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,\nto borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had\ndespatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both\nstewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body\nwith their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with\nwhich he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he\nmeant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating\nknife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,\nwith bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--\"Why,\nsir,\" replied the bo'swain's mate, \"the cockroaches have been and gone\nand eaten all our razors, they has, sir.\"Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,\nwith our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on\nevery face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on\nstrike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that\ntrod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the\nmoustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy\ntook no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do\npenance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any\nother place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical\nofficer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the\n_young_ surgeon;

\"I ain't afeard of their four\ndozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast\nthough; hum-m!\"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he\nbent down his eyes.\"What,\" said I, \"have you anything the matter with your chest?\"<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.\"Nay, Doctor, nay;

he was then firmly\ntied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a\nlittle basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now\nprepared.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the\npunishment.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the hallway.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not\nuse it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a\nhalf long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the\nthongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness\nof a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the\nfirst blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly\nand determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,\nand as unflinchingly received.Then, \"One dozen, sir, please,\" he reported, saluting the commander.\"Continue the punishment,\" was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to\npurple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the\nsuffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a\ncomrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of\nthe hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--\n\n\"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.\"\"Five, six,\" the corporal slowly counted--\"seven, eight.\"It is the\nlast dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood\ncomes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your\nfeelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he\nhad borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A\nlarge pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the\ntime; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was\nonly an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen\nsummers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;\nhaving become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and\njoined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,\nthat the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with\nthe golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself\naway in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very\noften got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and\nhad many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One\nday, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little\n\"ditty-box.\"Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings\nhe kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum\nsanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of\nportable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,\nthe giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and\nwas dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the\ncorporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and\ninelegant remark concerning the fair virgin.\"That is my sister,\" cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; \"she is a--\" and he added a word\nthat cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,\nin Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's\nlips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the\nboy's fist had drawn.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the apple there.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to\nreceive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was\ncarried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed\nin cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that\nhelpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough\nbo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and\ntender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward\non the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,\nreader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and\ncries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he\nwas an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look\ndown on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,\nfor scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were\nhushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and\nfor a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the\nopportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was\ncarried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further\nrelation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider\ncorporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing\nto human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even\n_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every\ntrue-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,\nor mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,\nwith folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic\nappeals for mercy, \"Continue the punishment\"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young\ndoctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'\nservice on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure\nthe expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is\npaid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size\nof which will depend on the \"drouthiness\" of the officer who contracts\nit.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid\nfor, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a\nmoderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings\nor more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,\ncomes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to\nten years.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.A few gentlemen out of each \"batch\" who \"pass\" into the\nservice, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are\npromoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as\nfairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain\nroutine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,\nindeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a\ncommission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is\ngranted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to\na harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is\nsupposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission\nabroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station\nfor three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he\nmight be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,\nthe marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he\nspends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his\npay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to\nseventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no\nwidow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But\nI fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,\nand say most emphatically, \"Don't;\" unless, indeed, the dear creature\nhas money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions\nabroad, and less of the \"bite and buffet\" about favours granted, the\nnavy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I\ndare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think\nthat there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life\nthey have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--\"With all thy\nfaults I love thee still.\"Whether the boys were orphans or not was a\nquestion which could not be answered.Upon the death of their\nmother, their father, a rich mine owner and geological expert, had\nleft the boys in the care of his brother, Randolph Rover, an\neccentric gentleman who devoted his entire time to scientific\nfarming.Anderson Rover had then journeyed to the western\ncoast of Africa, hoping to locate some valuable gold mines in the\nheart of the Dark Continent.He had plunged into the interior\nwith a number of natives, and that was the last heard of him,\nalthough Mr.Randolph Rover had made diligent inquiries concerning\nhis whereabouts.All of the boys were bright, fun-loving fellows, and to keep them\nout of mischief Randolph Rover had sent them off to Putnam Hall, a\nfirst class school, located some distance from Cedarville, a\npretty town on Lake Cayuga, in New York State.Here the lads had\nmade numerous friends and incidentally a number of enemies.Of the friends several have already been named, and others will\ncome to the front as our story proceeds.Of the enemies the\nprincipal ones were Arnold Baxter, a man who had tried, years\nbefore, to defraud the boys' father out of a gold mine in the\nWest, and his son Dan, who had once been the bully of Putnam Hall.Arnold Baxter's tool was a good-for-nothing scamp named Buddy\nGirk, who had once robbed Dick of his watch.Both of these men\nwere now in jail charged with an important robbery in Albany, and\nthe Rover boys had aided in bringing the men to justice.Dan, the\nbully, was also under arrest, charged with the abduction of Dora\nStanhope.Dora, who was Dick Rover's dearest friend, had been\ncarried off by the directions of Josiah Crabtree, a former teacher\nof Putnam Hall, who wished to marry Mrs.Stanhope and thus get his\nhands on the money the widow held in trust for her daughter, but\nthe abduction had been nipped in the bud and Josiah Crabtree had\nfled, leaving Dan Baxter to shoulder the blame of the transaction.How Dora was restored to her mother and what happened afterward,\nold readers already know.A winter had passed since the events narrated above, and before\nand after the holidays the Rover boys had studied diligently, to\nmake up for the time lost on that never-to-be-forgotten ocean\nchase.Their efforts had not been in vain, and each lad had been\npromoted to the next higher class, much to Randolph Rover's\nsatisfaction and the joy of their tender-hearted Aunt Martha.\"The boys are all right, even if they do love to play pranks,\" was\nRandolph Rover's comment, when he heard of the promotions.\"I\ntrust they improve their time during the term to come.\"\"They are good boys, Randolph,\" returned Mr.\"They would\nnot be real boys if they did not cut up once in a while.As to\ntheir daring--why, they simply take after their father.If only we knew, what had become of him.\"\"Yes, a great weight would be lifted from our shoulders, Martha,\nif we knew that.But we do not know, and there seems to be no way\nof finding out.I have written to the authorities at various\nplaces in Africa until I know not whom to address next.\"\"He must be dead, otherwise he would write or come home, Randolph.He was not one to keep us in the dark so long.\"\"I cannot believe my brother dead, and the boys will not believe\nit either.Do you know what Dick said to me before he left for\nschool?He said, that if we didn't get word he was going to\nAfrica some day to hunt his father up.\"What will that boy do in such a jungle, and among\nsuch fierce natives?The boy is uncommonly shrewd, when it comes to\ndealing with his enemies.Just look how nicely he and Tom and Sam\nserved Arnold Baxter and those others.It was wonderful doings--for\nboys.\"\"Yes, but they may not be so successful always, Randolph.I\nshould hate to see them run into any more, danger.\"But they will take care of themselves, I\nfeel that more and more every day,\" concluded Randolph Rover; and\nthere, for the time being, the subject was dropped.\"I wonder what has become of old Josiah Crabtree?\"remarked Dick\nRover, as he and his brothers walked around the parade ground to\ninspect several improvement which Captain Putnam had caused to be\nmade.\"I'm sure I can't guess,\" answered Tom.\"Like as not he became scared to death.I suppose you'll be\nsatisfied if he keeps away from Dora and her mother in the\nfuture?\"\"Yes; I never want to set eyes on him again, Tom.He worried the\nwidow half to death with his strange ways.\"\"I wonder how the Baxters feel to be locked up?\"\"I\nknow Arnold Baxter is used to it, but it's a new experience for\nDan.\"\"Dan is as bad as his father,\" broke in Larry Colby, who had\njoined the brothers.\"I was glad to hear that Mumps had turned\nover a new leaf and cut the bully dead.\"\"By the way, do you know where\nMumps is now?In the mining business, out West, acting as some\nsort of a clerk.\"\"A spell in the West will take the nonsense out of him,\" came from\nDick.\"It was a great pity he ever got under Dan Baxter's\ninfluence I wonder how Arnold Baxter is getting along?He was\nquite severely wounded, you know, during that tussle on the\nyachts.\"\"He's about over that, so Frank Harrington says,\" replied Larry.\"I'll wager he is mighty bitter against you fellows for having put\nhim where he is.\"If a person is going to do wrong\nhe must take the consequences.Baxter might today be a fairly\nwell-to-do mine owner of the West and Dan might be a leading cadet\nhere.But instead they both threw themselves away--and now they\nmust take what comes.\"\"My father used to say it took all kind of people to make a\nworld,\" went on Larry.\"But I reckon we could do without the\nBaxter and the Buddy Girk kind.\"\"And the Josiah Crabtree kind,\" added Sam.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bathroom.\"Don't forget that\nmiserable sneak.\"\"Perhaps Crabtree has reformed, like Mumps.\"\"It wasn't in him to reform, Larry,\" came from Tom.\"Oh, how I\ndetested him, with his slick, oily tongue!I wish they had caught\nhim and placed him where he deserved to be, with the Baxters.\"\"Yes, and then we could--\"", "question": "Where is the apple?

I dink me dis vos von school only.\"\"So it is--a school to learn how to shoot and scalp.\"\"Cut an Indian's top-knot off with a knife, this way,\" and Tom\nmade an imaginary slash at Hans' golden locks.stammered the German boy, falling back.\"No, I\nton't vant to learn to schalp, noputty.\"\"But you are willing to fight the Indians, are you not?\"\"We are all going to do that, you know.\"\"I ton't like dem Indians,\" sighed Hans.\"I see me some of dem\nvonde by a show in Chermany, und I vos afraid.\"How much further the joke would have\nbeen carried it is impossible to say, but just then a bell rang\nand the boys had to go into the classroom.But Tom remembered\nabout the Indians, as the others found out about a week later.As the majority of the scholars had been to the Hall before, it\ndid not take long for matters to become settled, and in a few days\nall of the boys felt thoroughly at home, that is, all but Jim\nCaven, who went around with that same sneaking look on his face\nthat Tom had first noticed.He made but few friends, and those\nonly among the smaller boys who had plenty of pocket money to\nspend.Caven rarely showed any money of his own.With the coming of spring the cadets formed, as of old, several\nfootball teams, and played several notches, including one with\ntheir old rivals, the pupils of Pornell Academy.This game they\nlost, by a score of four to five, which made the Pornellites feel\nmuch better, they having lost every game in the past.(For the\ndoings of the Putnam Hall students previous to the arrival at that\ninstitution of the Rover boys see, \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" the\nfirst volume of which is entitled, \"The Putnam Hall Cadets.\"--Publisher)\n\n\"Well, we can't expect to beat always,\" said Tom, who played\nquarterback on the Putnam team.\"Yes, and we might have won if Larry hadn't slipped and sprained\nhis ankle,\" put in Sam.\"Well, never mind; better luck next time.Sam was right so far as a game\nbetween the rival academies was concerned, but none of the Rover\nboys were on hand to take part in the contest--for reasons which\nthe chapter to follow will disclose.With the football came kite-flying, and wonderful indeed were some\nof the kites which the boys manufactured.\"I can tell you, if a fellow had time he could reduce kite-flying\nto a regular science,\" said Dick.\"Oh, Dick, don't give us any more science!\"\"We get\nenough of science from, Uncle Randolph, with his scientific\nfarming, fowl-raising, and the like.I would just as lief fly an\nold-fashioned kite as anything.\"\"Dick is right, though,\" put in Fred Garrison.\"Now you have a\nbig flat-kite there, three times larger than mine.Yet I'll wager\nmy little box kite will fly higher than your kite.\"\"Ice cream for the boys of our dormitory,\" answered Fred.\"All right, but how is a fellow to get the cream if he loses?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.\"That's for him to find out, Sam.If I lose I'll sneak off to\nCedarville, as Dick did once, and buy what I need.\"\"Ice cream for our room it is,\" said.\"And mum's the word about the wager, or Captain Putnam will spoil\nthe whole affair if he gets wind of it.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the garden.\"I'd just like to lay hands on\nabout two quarts of chocolate cream.\"\"There won't be any stakeholder,\" said Dick.\"But when is this kite-flying contest to come off?\"The matter was talked over, and it was decided to wait until the\nnext Saturday, which would be, as usual, a half-holiday.In the\nmeantime some of the other boys heard there was going to be a\ncontest, although they knew nothing of the wager made, and half a\ndozen other matches were arranged.Saturday proved to be cool and clear with a stiff breeze blowing\ndirectly from the west.This being so, it was decided, in order\nto get clear of the woods in front of the Hall, to hold the\ncontests on Baker's Plain, a level patch of ground some distance\nto the westward.The cadets were soon on the way, shouting and laughing merrily\nover the sport promised.Only a few remained behind, including\nJim Caven, who gave as his excuse that he had a headache.\"I'm glad he is not with us,\" said Dick.\"I declare, for some\nreason, I can't bear to have him around.\"\"It's queer, but he gives me the shivers\nwhenever he comes near me.\"\"It's a wonder he came here at all.He doesn't belong in our\nstyle of a crowd.\"To reach Baker's Plain the cadets had to make a detour around a\nhigh cliff which overlooked a rocky watercourse which flowed into\nCayuga Lake.They moved slowly, as nobody wished to damage his\nkite, and it was after two o'clock before all hands were ready for\nthe first trial at kite-flying.\"Sam, have you a good strong cord on your kite?\"\"The strongest I could get,\" answered the youngest Rover.\"I\nguess it is stronger than what Fred has.\"\"My kite won't pull like yours,\" said Fred Garrison.\"Then up they go--and may the best kite win!\"Soon a dozen kites of various kinds were soaring in the air, some\nquite steadily and others darting angrily from side to side.One\nwent up with a swoop, to come down with a bang on the rocks, thus\nknocking itself into a hundred pieces.\"Mine\nGretchen kite vos busted up--und I spent me feefteen cents on\nhim alreety!\"She will pull strong enough for two, I am sure.\"The Katydid was a wonderful affair of silver and gold which Dick\nhad constructed on ideas entirely his own.It went up slowly but\nsurely and proved to be as good a kite as the majority.A number of girls living in the neighborhood, bad heard of the\nkite-flying contests, and now they came up, Dora Stanhope with the\nrest, accompanied by her two cousins, Grace and Nellie Laning.As\nmy old readers may guess, Dick was very attentive to Dora, and his\nbrothers were scarcely less so to the two Laning sisters.Dick asked of Dora, during the course of\ntheir conversation.\"She is much better,\" replied Dora, \"although she is still weak\nfrom her sickness.\"\"Does she ever mention Josiah Crabtree?\"She said that she had dreamed of him and\nof you, Nick.\"\"Oh--it was only a silly affair, Dick, not worth mentioning.\"\"But I would like to know what it was.\"\"Well, then, she dreamed that both of you were in a big forest and\nhe was about to attack you with a gun or a club, she couldn't tell\nwhich.She awoke screaming and I ran to her side, and that is how\nshe told me of the dream.\"CHAPTER III\n\nAN OLD ENEMY TURNS UP\n\n\n\"That was certainly an odd dream,\" said Dick, after a short pause.\"I am sure I never want to meet Josiah Crabtree under such\ncircumstances.\"\"It was silly, Dick--I'd forget it if I was you.\"\"And she never mentioned the man at any other time?\"But I am certain she is glad he has left for parts unknown.I never, never, want to see him again,\" and the girl shivered.\"Don't be alarmed, Dora; I don't think he will dare to show\nhimself,\" answered Dick, and on the sly gave her hand a tight\nsqueeze.They were warmer friends than ever since Dick had\nrescued her from those who had abducted her.The kite-flying was now in \"full blast,\" as Sam expressed it, and\nthe boys had all they could do to keep the various lines from\nbecoming tangled up.His own kite and Fred's were side by side\nand for a long time it looked as if neither would mount above the\nother.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"Play out a bit more, Sam; you haven't given your kite all the\nslack she wants,\" said others.So the talk ran on, while each\ncontestant did the best to make his kite mount higher.In the\nmeantime the wind kept increasing in violence, making each kite\npull harder than ever.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the bedroom.\"It's a dandy for flying,\" panted Tom, who was holding his kite\nwith all the strength he possessed.\"Something must give way\nsoon,\" and something did give way.It was the string he was\nholding, and as it snapped he went over on his back in such a\ncomical fashion that all, even to the girls, had to laugh.\"If I had I'd a-gone up in the clouds,\" answered Tom ruefully.\"That's the last of that kite, I suppose; if I--\"\n\n\"The string has caught on Sam's kite!\"\"Fred, your flying is\nnowhere now.\"\"He didn't calculate to fly one kite against two,\" answered Fred.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.\"Hold on, Sam, where are you going?\"Oh, stop him somebody, before he goes over the cliff!\"\"Don't go any closer to the\ncliff!\"\"Oh, dear, it's cutting me like a knife!\"<|begin_of_text|>John took the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the milk there.\"He's in a mess,\" came from Frank.\"If he isn't careful he'll go\nover the cliff, as sure as he's born!\"went on Dick, and, leaving his kite in Hans\nMueller's care, he ran after his brother.By this time Sam had gained a few bushes which grew but a dozen\nfeet away from the edge of the cliff, that at this point was\nnearly forty feet in height.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.With his right hand held a painful\nprisoner, he clutched at the bushes with his left.\"I've got the bushes, but I can't hold on long!\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk there.he panted, as\nDick came close.Scarcely had the words left his mouth when the bushes came up by\nthe roots and poor Sam fell over on his side.Then came another\nstrong puff of wind, and he was dragged to the very edge of the\nrocky ledge!he screamed, when, making a mighty leap, Dick caught\nhim by the foot.\"If you\ndon't you'll be killed!\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the football.\"Oh, Dick, don't let me go\nover!\"\"I'll do my best, Sam,\" was Dick's answer, and he held on like\ngrim death.By this time half a dozen boys were running to the scene.Dora\nStanhope followed, and as she came up she pulled a tiny penknife\nfrom her pocket.\"Can't I cut the line with this?\"she asked, timidly, as she\npushed her way to Dick's side.\"Oh, my wrist is almost cut in\ntwo!\"Stooping low, Dora sawed away at the kite line, which was as taut\nas a string on a bass fiddle.Suddenly there was a loud snap and\nthe cord parted.Sam and Dick fell back from the edge of the\ncliff, while the entangled kites soared away for parts unknown.\"Thank Heaven you cut the line, Dora!\"said Dick, who was the\nfirst to recover from the excitement of the situation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.He saw\nthat Dora was trembling like a leaf, and he hastened to her\nsupport, but she pushed him away and pointed to Sam.\"Don't mind me--I am all right, Dick,\" she said.\"Here is my handkerchief; he had better bind it up with that,\"\nsaid Grace Laning, as she offered the article.\"We'll wash the wound first,\" put in Frank, and raced off for some\nwater.Soon he returned with his stiff hat full, and the cut on\nSam's wrist was tenderly washed by the Laning girls, who then\nbound it up with the skill of a hospital surgeon.The kite-flying continued for the balance of the afternoon.But\nSam and Dick had had enough of it, and, along with Tom, they took\na stroll along the lake front with Dora Stanhope and Grace and\nNellie.Of course both boys and girls talked a whole lot of\nnonsense, yet all enjoyed the walk very much.\"This is the spot where they abducted me,\" shivered Dora, as they\ncame to the old boathouse.\"Oh, what a dreadful time that was, to\nbe sure!\"\"I don't believe our enemies will bother you any more, Dora,\" said\nDick.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple.\"It's not likely that old Crabtree Will try the same game\ntwice; and Mumps has really turned over a new leaf and gone to\nwork for a living.\"\"Yes, I was glad to hear that, for I don't believe he was such a\nbad fellow at heart.He was under Dan Baxter's influence, just\nas--as--\"\n\n\"As Josiah Crabtree tried to influence your mother,\" whispered\nDick, and Dora nodded slowly.\"Well, let us forget it, and--My\ngracious!\"Dick stopped short, to stare in open-mouthed wonder at a small\nboat shooting down the lake at a distance of several hundred yards\nfrom the shore.\"Don't you see that fellow in the boat?\"demanded Dick, in\nincreased wonder.\"Of course we see him,\" answered Tom.\"No; he's too far off,\" came from Sam..\n\n\"It's Dan Baxter!\"\"It does look a little like Baxter,\" was Sam's slow comment.\"Yet\nit seems impossible that he could be here, as Tom says.\"\"I say it's Baxter,\" affirmed Dick stoutly,  \"", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John took the football there.interposed Dora, becoming\nalarmed.\"Don't be alarmed--he shan't hurt anybody, Dora.\"At first there was no reply, and the boy in the rowboat kept on\npulling.But as Dick repeated his call, the rower threw up his\noars.\"You mind your own business,\" he growled.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.\"Guess I can row on the\nlake if I want to.\"\"I wish my wrist wasn't so sore--I'd\ngo after him.\"\"There's a boat below here,\" said Dick.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"He may--may shoot at you,\" faltered Dora.\"You know how wicked\nhe can be at times.\"\"But he ought to be handed\nover to the authorities.It is a crime to let him go free.\"Come over here; we want to talk to you!\"growled the former bully of Putnam Hall.\"If you don't come we'll bring\nyou.\"\"Hush, Sam, or you'll make a mess of things!\"cried Dick softly,\nbut the warning came too late.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the football.\"Just try it on and\nsee how I'll fix you.\"\"Come on for the boat,\" said Tom.\"We'll show him he can't scare\nus.\"Sam was also about to\nfollow, when his elder brother stopped him.\"You can't do much with that sore wrist, Sam,\" he said.\"Better\nstay with the girls until we come back.You can watch events from\nthe shore, and run for assistance, if it's necessary.\"Sam demurred at first, but soon saw the wisdom of  Dick's\nreasoning and consented to remain behind.By this time Tom had shoved out the rowboat Dick had mentioned--a\nneat craft belonging to a farmer living near.A pair of oars\nlay in a locker on the lake bank; and, securing these, Tom leaped\non board of the craft, and soon Dick came after.Dan Baxter had watched their movement with interest, which\nspeedily gave way to arm when he saw the other boat come out, and\nbeheld Dick and Tom each take up an oar and begin to pull for all\nthey could.\"I was a clam to come up here, when there  is no real need for\nit,\" he muttered.Well, I reckon I can put up a\npretty stiff fight if it comes to the worst.\"Then he caught up\nhis oars once more, and began to row down Cayuga Lake with all\npossible speed.CHAPTER IV\n\nTHE CHASE ON THE LAKE\n\n\n\"He means to give us as much of a chase as possible,\" remarked\nTom, as he glanced over his shoulder.\"If I remember rightly,\nBaxter was always a pretty fair oarsman.\"\"Yes, that was the one thing he could do well,\" returned Dick.\"But we ought to be able to catch him, Tom.\"\"We could if we had two pairs of oars.One pair can do just about\nso much and no more.\"Now, both together, and put all your muscle into it,\"\nand Dick set a stiff stroke that his brother followed with\ndifficulty.Baxter had been rowing down the lake, but as soon as he saw that\nhe was being pursued he changed his course for the east shore.He\nwas settled to his work, and for several minutes it was hard to\ntell whether he was holding his own or losing.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.cried Dick, after pulling for five\nminutes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football.\"Keep at it, Tom, and we'll have him before he is half\nover.\"\"He\nmust be almost exhausted to row like that.\"He sees the prison cell staring\nhim in the face again.<|begin_of_text|>John got the football there.You'd do your best, too, if you were in\nhis place.\"<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the football there.Dick set a faster stroke than ever, having caught his\nsecond wind, and the rowboat flew over the calm surface of the\nlake like a thing of life.The cry came from Baxter, while he was still a\nhundred yards from the eastern shore.\"Keep off, or it will be\nthe worse for you!\"\"We are not afraid of you, Baxter, and you ought to know it by\nthis time,\" answered Dick.\"You may as well give in now as later\non.\"\"We are two to one, and you know what we have been able to do in\nthe past.\"I don't intend to go to jug again, and that is all there\nis to it.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.Are you--going to keep off or not?\"If you don't I--I'll shoot you.\"As Dan Baxter spoke he stopped rowing and brought from a hip\npocket a highly polished nickel-plated revolver.he demanded, as he pointed the weapon toward\nthe Rover boys.Both Dick and Tom were taken aback at the sight of the weapon.But they had seen such arms before, and had faced them,\nconsequently they were not as greatly alarmed as they right\notherwise have been.They knew, too, that Dan Baxter was a\nnotoriously bad shot.\"Put that up, Baxter,\" said Dick calmly.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.\"It may only get you\ninto deeper trouble.\"\"I'm not going back to\njail and that is all there, is to it!\"\"You won't dare to shoot at us, and you know it,\" put in Tom, as\nthe two boats drifted closer together.\"I will, and don't you fool yourself on it.\"\"Drop those oars or I'll fire, as sure as my name is Dan Baxter,\"\nand the revolver, which had been partly lowered, was raised a\nsecond time.It must be confessed that Dick and Tom were much disconcerted.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.The two rowboats were now less than fifty feet apart, and any kind\nof a shot from the weapon was likely to prove more or less\ndangerous.Baxter's eyes gleamed with the hatred of an angry\nsnake ready to strike.\"You think you are smart, you Rover boys,\" said the bully, after\nan awkward pause all around.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the kitchen.\"You think you did a big thing in\nrescuing Dora Stanhope and in putting me and my father and Buddy\nGirk in prison.But let me tell you that this game hasn't come to\nan end yet, and some day we intend to square accounts.\"\"There is no use in wasting breath in this fashion, Baxter,\"\nreturned Dick, as calmly as he could.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.\"We are two to one, and the\nbest thing to do is for you to submit.If you fire on us, we may\ndo a little shooting on our own account.\"Do you imagine you can scare me in that fashion?You\nhaven't any pistol, and I know it.If you had you would have\ndrawn the weapon long ago.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.\"Don't be too sure,\" he said steadily,\nas the boats drifted still closer together.\"The minute I heard\nyou had escaped from jail I went and bought a pistol in\nCedarville.\"This was the strict truth, but Dick did not add that\nthe weapon lay at that moment safe in the bottom of his trunk at\nthe Hall.\"Got afraid I'd come around, eh?\"Now will you--\"\n\nDick did not have time to finish, for, lowering the front end of\nthe pistol, Dan Baxter pulled the trigger twice and two reports\nrang out in quick succession.One bullet buried itself in the\nseat beside Tom, while the second plowed its way through the\nbottom, near the stern.cried Dick, and in his excitement hurled his oar at\nDan Baxter, hitting the fellow across the fact with such force\nthat the bully's nose began to bleed.The shock made Baxter lose\nhis hold on the pistol and it went over the side of his craft and\nsank immediately to the bottom of the lake.muttered Tom, as he gazed at the\nhole through the seat.\"A little closer and I would have got it\nin the stomach.\"A yell now came from Sam, and a shriek from the girls, all of whom\nhad heard the pistol shots.They were too far away to see the\nresult of the shooting and feared both Tom and Dick had been\nkilled or wounded.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the bedroom.As quickly as he could recover from the blow of the oar, Dan\nBaxter picked up his own blades, and without paying attention to\nthe blood which was flowing from his nose, began once again to\npull for the shore.shouted Dick, and then his face\nfell.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.\"Confound it, I've thrown away my oar!<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.And\nhe pointed some distance to their left.\"Look at that hole in\nthe bottom, made by that pistol shot.The water is coming in just\nas fast as it can.\"There was small need to call attention to it, for the water in the\nbottom of the boat was already an inch deep.Dick started in\nperplexity, then, struck by a sudden idea, drew a lead pencil from\nhis pocket and rammed it into the opening.It fitted very well,\nand the water ceased, to come in.\"Now we'll have to bail out and pick up that other oar,\" said Tom.\"It was foolish to throw it away, Dick.\"Paddle over, and I'll pick it up.\"Tom did so, and the blade was\nspeedily recovered.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.But Dan Baxter had made good use of the precious moments lost by\nthe Rover boys, and hardly were the latter into shape for rowing\nonce more than they saw the bully beach his craft and leap out on\nthe shore.\"I told you\nthat you couldn't catch me.The next time we meet I'll make you\nsorry that you ever followed me,\" and he started to run off with\nall possible speed.Tom and Dick were too chagrined to answer him, and pulled forward\nto the shore in silence.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.They ran the craft into some bushes and\ntied up, and then started after Baxter, who was now making for the\nwoods south of the village of Nelson.When the highway skirting this portion of Cayuga Lake was gained\nDan Baxter was a good five hundred feet ahead of them.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bedroom.A turn in\nthe road soon hid him from view.Gaining the bend they discovered\nthat he had disappeared from view altogether.\"He has taken to the woods,\" sighed Dick.\"If that is so we may as well give the hunt up,\" answered his\nbrother.\"It would be worse than looking for a pin in a haystack,\nfor we wouldn't know what direction he had taken.\"\"I wish I had a bloodhound with which to trail him.He ought to\nbe run down, Tom.\"\"Well, let us notify some of the people living near and see what\ncan be done.\"<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the apple there.They ran on to the spot where they supposed Baxter had left the\nhighway.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the apple there.On both sides were dense thickets of cedars with heavy\nunderbrush.All in all, the locality formed an ideal hiding\nplace.Night was coming on by the time they gained the nearest farmhouse.Here they found three men, to whom they explained the situation.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"If he went into the woods it would be a hard job to trail him,\"\nwas the comment from Farmer Mason.\"If he ain't careful he'll\nlose himself so completely he'll never git out, b'gosh!\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.\"Well, I don't know but what that would suit me,\" responded Tom\ndryly.The search was begun, and several others joined in.It lasted\nuntil night was fairly upon the party and was then given up in\ndisgust.\"But we ought to notify the authorities,\" said Tom.\"They will\nprobably put a detective on his track.\"\"Yes; but a detective can't do any more than we can, up in this\nwild locality.\"\"Well, we can send the police a telegram from Cedarville.\"This was done, and the Rover boys returned to Putnam Hall by way\nof the side road leaving past the homes of the Stanhopes and the\nLanings.They found Sam and the girls very anxious concerning\ntheir welfare.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the hallway.\"We were afraid you had been shot,\" said Dora.\"But it's too bad that Baxter got away.I\nwonder where he will turn up next.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the bedroom.They all wondered, but could not even venture an answer.Soon the\nboys left the girls and hurried to the academy, where their story,\nhad to be told over again.Captain Putnam looked exceedingly\ngrave over the narrative.\"You must be careful in the future, lads,\" he said.\"Remember,\nyou are in my care here.I do not know what your uncle would say\nif anything should happen to you.\"\"We will be on our guard in the future,\" answered Dick.\"But I am\nawfully sorry we didn't catch him.\"\"So am I.  But perhaps the authorities will have better luck,\" and\nthere the talk came to an end, and the boys retired for the night.CHAPTER V\n\nFUN AND AN EXPLOSION\n\n\nSeveral days slipped by, and the boys waited anxiously for some\nnews from the authorities.But none came, and they rightfully\nsurmised that, for the time being, Dan Baxter had made good his\nescape.On account of the disastrous ending to the kite-flying match, many\nhad supposed that the feast in Dormitory No.6 was not to come\noff, but Sam, Tom, Frank, and several others got their heads\ntogether and prepared for a \"layout\" for the following Wednesday,\nwhich would be Dick's birthday.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.\"We'll give him a surprise,\" said Sam, and so it was agreed.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Passing around the hat netted exactly three dollars and a quarter,\nand Tom, Sam, and Fred Garrison were delegated to purchase the\ncandies, cake, and ice cream which were to constitute the spread.\"We'll do the thing up brown,\" said Sam.\"We must strike higher than that feast we had, last year.\"came from Tom, \"Oh dear, do you remember how we\nserved Mumps that night!\"and he set up a roar over the\nremembrance of the scene.Hans Mueller had become one of the occupants of the dormitory, and\nhe was as much, interested as anybody in the preparations for the\nspread.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the milk there.\"I like to have von feast\ntwist a veek, ha I ha!\"He's a jolly dog,\" said Tom to Frank.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.\"But, say, I've been thinking of having some fun with him before\nthis spread comes off.\"\"Let me in on the ground floor,\" pleaded Frank, who always wok a\ngreat interest in Tom's jokes.But the tide was fast advancing; they began to take down the easel, and\nI remembered that the narrow winding cave was our only way out from\nthis rock-inclosed fairy paradise to the prosaic beach.\"Look, they are wading ashore up to the knees!And we shall have to\nwade too if we don't make haste back.\"So cried the perplexed mother of the six too-adventurous ducklings.But mine, more considerate, answered me from the rocks where they were\nscrambling, and helped me back through the cave into safe quarters,\nwhere we stood watching the waders with mingled excitement and--envy?I can still recall the delicious sensation of paddling across the\nsmooth sea-sand, and of walking up the bed of a Highland burn.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the apple there.the change twixt Now and Then,\" I sat calmly on a stone, dry-shod; as\nwas best.Still, is it not a benign law of nature, that the things we\nare no longer able to do, we almost cease to wish to do?Perhaps even\nthe last cessation of all things will come naturally at the end, as\nnaturally as we turn round and go to sleep at night?I am proud to think how high and steep was\nthe cliff we re-ascended, all three of us, and from which we stood\nand looked at sky and sea.Such a sea and such a sky: amber clear, so\nthat one could trace the whole line of coast--Mount's Bay, with St.Michael's Mount dotted in the midst of it, and even the Land's End,\nbeyond which the sun, round and red, was just touching the top of the\nwaves.We should have liked to watch him drop below them--that splendid\nsea-sunset of which one never tires, but we had some distance to walk,\nand we began to rejoice in the prospect of Mary Mundy's tea.\"I'll go on ahead and have the carriage ready,\" said the ever\nthought", "question": "Where is the milk? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "Just follow the\nhedges\"--that tempting aerial promenade, to which we were now getting\naccustomed, becoming veritable Blondins in petticoats--\"then cross the\ncornfield; and take to the hedges again.You'll be at the farm-yard\ndirectly.\"Not quite--for we lingered, tempted by the abundance of corn-flowers,\nof which we gathered, not handfuls but armfuls.When we reached\nit, what a picture of an English farm-yard it was!With a regular\nold-fashioned English milk-maid--such as Izaak Walton would have loved\nto describe--sitting amidst her shining pails, her cows standing round\nher, meekly waiting their turn.Sleek, calm creatures they were,\nJuno-eyed and soft-skinned--of that peculiar shade of grey which I\nhave seen only in Cornwall.And, being rather a connoisseur in cows,\nI have often amused myself to notice how the kine of each country\nhave their own predominant colour, which seems to harmonise with its\nspecial landscape.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.The curious yellow tint of Highland cattle, the red,\nwhite, or brown of those of the midland counties, and the delicate\ngrey of Cornish cows, alike suit the scene around them, and belong to\nit as completely as the dainty little Swiss herds do to their Alpine\npastures, or the large, mild, cream- oxen to the Campagna at\nRome.But we had to tear ourselves away from this Arcadia, for in the midst\nof the farm-yard appeared the carriage and Charles.So we jolted\nback--it seemed as if Cornish carriages and horses could go anywhere\nand over everything--to the Old Inn and Mary Mundy.<|begin_of_text|>John dropped the milk.She _had_ come home, and everything was right.As we soon found,\neverything and everybody was accustomed to be put to rights by Miss\nMary Mundy.She stood at the door to greet us--a bright, brown-faced little\nwoman with the reddest of cheeks and the blackest of eyes; I have no\nhesitation in painting her portrait here, as she is, so to speak,\npublic property, known and respected far and wide.[Illustration: A CRABBER'S HOLE, GERRAN'S BAY.]\"Delighted to see you, ladies; delighted to see any friends of the\nProfessor's; and I hope you enjoyed the Cove, and that you're all\nhungry, and will find your tea to your liking.It's the best we can do;\nwe're very homely folk here, but we try to make people comfortable,\"\nand so on and so on, a regular stream of chatty conversation, given in\nthe strongest Cornish, with the kindliest of Cornish hearts, as she\nushered us into a neat little parlour at the back of the inn.There lay spread, not one of your dainty afternoon teas, with two or\nthree wafery slices of bread and butter, but a regular substantial\nmeal.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Cheerful candles--of course in serpentine candlesticks--were\nalready lit, and showed us the bright teapot full of that welcome drink\nto weary travellers, hot, strong and harmless; the gigantic home-baked\nloaf, which it seemed sacrilegious to have turned into toast; the rich,\nyellow butter--I am sure those lovely cows had something to do with\nit, and also with the cream, so thick that the spoon could almost have\nstood upright in it.Besides, there was a quantity of that delicious\nclotted cream, which here accompanies every meal and of which I had\nvainly tried to get the receipt, but was answered with polite scorn,\n\"Oh, ma'am, it would be of no use to _you_: Cornish cream can only be\nmade from Cornish cows!\"Whether this remarkable fact in natural history be true or not, let me\nrecord the perfection of Mary Mundy's cream, which, together with her\njam and her marmalade, was a refection worthy of the gods.She pressed us again and again to \"have some more,\" and her charge for\nour magnificent meal was as small as her gratitude was great for the\nslight addition we made to it.\"No, I'll not say no, ma'am, it'll come in handy; us has got a young\nniece to bring up--my brother and me--please'm.Yes, I'm glad you came,\nand I hope you'll come again, please'm.And if you see the Professor,\nyou'll tell him he's not forgotten, please'm.\"This garniture of \"please'm\" at the end of every sentence reminded\nus of the Venetian \"probbedirla,\" _per ubbedirla_, with which our\ngondolier Giovanna used to amuse us, often dragging it in in the oddest\nway.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.\"Yes, the Signora will get a beautiful day, probbedirla,\" or \"My\nwife has just lost her baby, probbedirla.\"Mary Mundy's \"please'm\"\noften came in with equal incongruity, and her voluble tongue ran on\nnineteen to the dozen; but her talk was so shrewd and her looks so\npleasant--once, no doubt, actually pretty, and still comely enough for\na middle-aged woman--that we departed, fully agreeing with her admiring\nProfessor that\n\n  \"The brightest thing on Cornish land\n  Is the face of Miss Mary Mundy.\"Recrossing Pradenack down in the dim light of a newly-risen moon,\neverything looked so solitary and ghostly that we started to see moving\nfrom behind a furz-bush, a mysterious figure, which crossed the road\nslowly, and stood waiting for us.Was it man or ghost, or--\n\nOnly a donkey!It might have been Tregeagle\nhimself--Tregeagle, the grim mad-demon of Cornish tradition, once a\ndishonest steward, who sold his soul to the devil, and is doomed to\nkeep on emptying Dozmare Pool, near St.Neots (the same mere wherein\nExcalibur was thrown), with a limpet-shell; and to spend his nights in\nother secluded places balancing interminable accounts, which are always\njust sixpence wrong.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football there.I fear some of us, weak in arithmetic, had a secret\nsympathy for him!But we never met him--nor anything worse than that\nspectral donkey, looming large and placid against the level horizon.Soon, \"the stars came out by twos and threes,\"--promising a fine night\nand finer morning, during which, while we were comfortably asleep,\nour good horse and man would be driving across this lonely region to\nFalmouth, in time to take the good people to church on Sunday morning.\"And we'll do it, too--don't you be anxious about us, ladies,\" insisted\nCharles.\"I'll feed him well, and groom him well.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the milk there.I likes to take care\nof a good horse, and you'll see, he'll take no harm.I'll be back when\nyou want me, at the week's end, or perhaps before then, with some party\nor other--we're always coming to the Lizard--and I'll just look in and\nsee how you're getting on, and how you liked Kynance.We thanked our kindly charioteer, bade him and his horse good-bye,\nwished him a pleasant journey through the moonlight, which was every\nminute growing more beautiful, then went indoors to supper--no!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the apple there.supper\nwould have been an insult to Mary Mundy's tea--to bed.DAY THE FOURTH\n\n\nSunday, September 4th--and we had started on September 1st; was it\npossible we had only been travelling four days?<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple there.We had seen so much, taken in so many\nnew interests--nay, made several new friends.Already we began to plan\nanother meeting with John Curgenven, who we found was a relation of\nour landlady, or of our bright-faced serving maiden, Esther--I forget\nwhich.But everybody seemed connected with everybody at the Lizard,\nand everybody took a friendly interest in everybody.The arrival of\nnew lodgers in the \"genteel\" parlour which we had not appreciated\nwas important information, and we were glad to hear that Charles had\nstarted about four in the morning quite cheery.And what a morning it was!--a typical Sabbath, a day of rest, a day\nto rejoice in.Strolling round the garden at eight o'clock, while the\ndew still lay thick on the grass, and glittered like diamonds on the\nautumnal spider-webs, even the flowers seemed to know it was Sunday,\nthe mignonette bed to smell sweeter, the marigolds--yes!aesthetic\nfashion is right in its love for marigolds--burnt in a perfect blaze\nof golden colour and aromatic scent.The air was so mild that we could\nimagine summer was still with us: and the great wide circle of sea\ngleamed in the sunshine as if there never had been, never could be,\nsuch a thing as cloud or storm.Having ascertained that there was no service nearer than Grade, some\nmiles off, until the afternoon, we \"went to church\" on the cliffs, in\nPistol Meadow, beside the green mounds where the two hundred drowned\nsailors sleep in peace.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the apple there.[Illustration: STEAM SEINE BOATS GOING OUT.]Absolutely solitary: not a living creature,\nnot even a sheep came near me the whole morning:--and in the silence\nI could hear almost every word said by my young folks, searching for\nsea-treasures among the rocks and little pools far below.Westwards\ntowards Kynance, and eastwards towards Landewednack--the church we were\nto go to in the afternoon--the cliff path was smooth and green, the\nshort grass full of those curious dainty flowers, some of which were\nnew to our eager eyes.At other times the road was so precipitous that\nwe did not wonder at those carefully white-washed stones every few\nyards, which are the sole guide to the coastguard men of dark nights.Even in daylight, if the wind were high, or the footing slippery with\nrain, the cliff-walk from the Lizard to Kynance would be no joke to\nuninitiated feet.Now, all was so still that the wind never once fluttered the letter I\nwas writing, and so warm that we were glad to escape the white glare of\nthe wall of the Lizard Lights and sit in a cool hollow, watching sky\nand ocean, with now and then a sea-bird floating lazily between, a dark\nspeck on the perpetual blue.\"If it will only keep like this all week!\"And, as we sat, we planned\nout each day, so as to miss nothing, and lose nothing--either of time\nor strength: doing enough, but never too much--as is often the fatal\nmistake of tourists.And then, following the grand law of travelling,\nto have one's \"meals reg'lar\"--we went indoors and dined.Afterwards in\nhonour of the day\n\n        \"that comes between\n  The Saturday and Monday,\"\n\nwe dressed ourselves in all our best--very humble best it was!--to join\nthe good people going to church at Landewednack.This, which in ancient Cornish means \"the white-roofed church of St.Wednack\"--hagiologists must decide who that individual was!--is the\nname of the parish to which the comparatively modern Lizard Town\nbelongs.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the office.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the football there.The church is in a very picturesque corner, close to the sea,\nthough both it and the rectory are protected by a sudden dip in the\nground, so that you see neither till you are close upon them.A fine\nNorman doorway, a curious hagioscope, and other points, interesting to\narchaeologists--also the neatest and prettiest of churchyards--make\nnote-worthy this, the most southerly church in England.A fine old\nbuilding, not spoiled though \"restored.\"The modern open pews, and a\nmodern memorial pulpit of serpentine, jarred less than might have been\nexpected with the carefully-preserved remains of the past.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.In Landewednack church is said to have been preached the last sermon in\nCornish.Since, the ancient tongue has completely\ndied out, and the people of King Arthur's country have become wholly\nEnglish.Still, they are not the English of the midland and northern districts,\nbut of a very different type and race.I have heard it said that a\nseaboard population, accustomed to wrestle with the dangers of the\ncoast, to move about from place to place, see foreign countries, and\ncarry on its business in the deep waters, is always more capable, more\nintelligent, as a whole, than an inland people, whether agricultural\nor manufacturing.It may be so: but certainly the aborigines of\nLizard Town, who could easily be distinguished from the visitors--of\nwhom there was yet a tolerable sprinkling--made a very interesting\ncongregation; orderly, respectable, reverent; simple in dress and\nmanner, yet many of them, both the men and women, exceedingly\npicturesque.That is, the old men and the old women: the younger ones\naped modern fashion even here, in this out-of-the-way corner, and\nconsequently did not look half so well as their seniors.I must name one more member of the congregation--a large black dog,\nwho walked in and settled himself in the pew behind, where he behaved\nduring half the service in an exemplary manner, worthy of the Highland\nshepherds' dogs, who always come to church with their masters, and\nconduct themselves with equal decorum.There is always a certain pathos in going in to worship in a strange\nchurch, with a strange congregation, of whom you are as ignorant as\nthey of you.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.In the intervals of kneeling with them as \"miserable\nsinners,\" one finds oneself speculating upon them, their possible\nfaults and virtues, joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, watching the\nunknown faces, and trying to read thereon the records of a common\nhumanity.A silent homily, better perhaps than most sermons.Not that there was aught to complain of in the sermon, and the singing\nwas especially good.Many a London choir might have taken a lesson from\nthis village church at the far end of Cornwall.When service was over,\nwe lingered in the pretty and carefully tended churchyard, where the\nevening light fell softly upon many curious gravestones, of seafaring\nmen, and a few of wrecked sailors--only a few, since it is but within\na generation that bodies washed ashore from the deep were allowed to\nbe buried in consecrated ground; most of them, like the two hundred in\nPistol Meadow, being interred as near as convenient to where they were\nfound, without any burial rites.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the milk there.Still, in all the churchyards along\nthis coast are graves with a story.A little corner railed off has an\nold and sad one.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the apple.There lie buried the victims of the plague, which in\n1645 devastated the village.No one since has ever ventured to disturb\ntheir resting-place.Very green and peaceful the churchyard looked: the beautiful day was\ndying, beautiful to the last.We stood and watched the congregation\nmelt slowly away, disappearing down the lane, and then, attracted by\nthe sound of music, we re-entered the church.There we sat and listened\nfor another half-hour to the practising of an anthem ready for the\nharvest festival, which had been announced for the following Tuesday;\nexceedingly well done too, the rector's voice leading it all, with an\nenergy and enthusiasm that at once accounted for the capital condition\nof the choir.was our earnest sigh as we walked\nhome; and anxious not to lose a minute of it, we gave ourselves the\nbriefest rest, and turned out again, I to watch the sunset from the\ncliffs, while the others descended once more to their beloved sea-pools.\"Such anemones, such sea-weed!Besides,\nsunsets are all alike,\" added the youthful, practical, and slightly\nunpoetical mind.Every one has a mysterious charm of its\nown--just like that in every new human face.I have seen hundreds of\nsunsets in my time, and those I shall see are narrowing down now, but\nI think to the end of my life I

", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "The usual place where the sun dropped into the\nsea, just beyond the point of the Land's End, was all a golden mist.I hastened west, climbing one intervening cliff after the other,\nanxious not to miss the clear sight of him as he set his glowing\nfeet, or rather his great round disc, on the sea.At last I found a\n\"comfortable\" stone, sheltered from the wind, which blew tolerably\nfresh, and utterly solitary (as I thought), the intense silence\nbeing such that one could almost hear the cropping of three placid\nsheep--evidently well accustomed to sunsets, and thinking them of\nlittle consequence.There I sat until the last red spark had gone out, quenched in the\nAtlantic waters, and from behind the vanished sun sprung a gleam of\nabsolutely green light, \"like a firework out of a rocket,\" the young\npeople said; such as I had never seen before, though we saw it once\nafterwards.Nature's fireworks they were; and I could see even the two\nlittle black figures moving along the rocks below stand still to watch\nthem.I watched too, with that sort of lonely delight--the one shadow\nupon it being that it is so lonely--with which all one's life one is\naccustomed to watch beautiful and vanishing things.Then seeing how\nfast the colours were fading and the sky darkening, I rose; but just\ntook a step or two farther to look over the edge of my stone into the\nnext dip of the cliff, and there I saw--\n\n[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS--EVENING.]Nothing else would have\nsat so long and so silently, for I had been within three yards of them\nall the time, and had never discovered them, nor they me.They sat, quite absorbed in\none another, hand in hand, looking quietly seaward, their faces bathed\nin the rosy sunset--which to them was a sunrise, the sort of sun which\nnever rises twice in a life-time.Evidently they did not see me, in fact I just\npeered over the rock's edge and drew back again; any slight sound they\nprobably attributed to the harmless sheep.Well, it was but an equally\nharmless old woman, who did not laugh at them, as some might have done,\nbut smiled and wished them well, as she left them to their sunset, and\nturned to face the darkening east, where the sun would rise to-morrow.The moon was rising there now, and it was a picture to behold.Indeed,\nall these Cornish days seemed so full of moonrises and sunsets--and\nsunrises too--that it was really inconvenient.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.Going to bed seemed\nalmost a sin--as on this night, when, opening our parlour door, which\nlooked right on to the garden, we saw the whole world lying in a flood\nof moonlight peace, the marigolds and carnations leaning cheek to\ncheek, as motionless as the two young lovers on the cliff.must long ago have had their dream broken, for five minutes afterwards\nI had met a most respectable fat couple from Lizard Town taking their\nSunday evening stroll, in all their Sunday best, along those very\ncliffs.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.But perhaps, the good folks had once\nbeen lovers too.How the stars\nshone, without a mist or a cloud; how the Lizard Lights gleamed, even\nin spite of the moonlight, and how clear showed the black outline of\nKynance Cove, from which came through the silence a dull murmur of\nwaves!It was, as we declared, a sin and a shame to go to bed at all\nthough we had been out the whole day, and hoped to be out the whole of\nto-morrow.Still, human nature could not keep awake for ever.We passed\nfrom the poetical to the practical, and decided to lay us down and\nsleep.But, in the middle of the night I woke, rose, and looked out of the\nwindow.Sea and sky were one blackness, literally as \"black as\nink,\" and melting into one another so that both were undistinguishable.As for the moon and stars--heaven knows where they had gone to, for\nthey seemed utterly blotted out.The only light visible was the ghostly\ngleam of those two great eyes, the Lizard Lights, stretching far out\ninto the intense darkness.I never saw such darkness--unbroken even by\nthe white crest of a wave.And the stillness was like the stillness of\ndeath, with a heavy weight in the air which made me involuntarily go\nto sleep again, though with an awed impression of \"something going to\nhappen.\"And sure enough in another hour something did happen.I started awake,\nfeeling as if a volley of artillery had been poured in at my window.It was the wildest deluge of rain, beating against the panes, and with\nit came a wind that howled and shrieked round the house as if all the\ndemons in Cornwall, Tregeagle himself included, were let loose at once.Now we understood what a Lizard storm could be.I have seen\nMediterranean storms, sweeping across the Campagna like armed\nbattalions of avenging angels, pouring out their vials of wrath--rain,\nhail, thunder, and lightning--unceasingly for two whole days.I have\nbeen in Highland storms, so furious that one had to sit down in the\nmiddle of the road with one's plaid over one's head, till the worst of\ntheir rage was spent.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the football.But I never saw or heard anything more awful than\nthis Lizard storm, to which I lay and listened till the day began to\ndawn.Then the wind lulled a little, but the rain still fell in torrents,\nand the sky and sea were as black as ever.The weather had evidently\nbroken for good--that is, for evil.the harvest, and the harvest\nfestival!And alas--of minor importance, but still some, to us at\nleast--alas for our holiday in Cornwall!It was with a heavy heart that, feeling there was not the slightest use\nin getting up, I turned round and took another sleep.DAY THE FIFTH\n\n\n\"Hope for the best, and be prepared for the worst,\" had been the motto\nof our journey.So when we rose to one of the wettest mornings that\never came out of the sky, there was a certain satisfaction in being\nprepared for it.\"We must have a fire, that is certain,\" was our first decision.This\nentailed the abolition of our beautiful decorations--our sea-holly\nand ferns; also some anxious looks from our handmaiden.Apparently no\nfire, had been lit in this rather despised room for many months--years\nperhaps--and the chimney rather resented being used.A few agonised\ndown-puffs greatly interfered with the comfort of the breakfast table,\nand an insane attempt to open the windows made matters worse.Which was most preferable--to be stifled or deluged?<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.We were just\nconsidering the question, when the chimney took a new and kinder\nthought, or the wind took a turn--it seemed to blow alternately from\nevery quarter, and then from all quarters at once--the smoke went up\nstraight, the room grew warm and bright, with the cosy peace of the\nfirst fire of the season.Existence became once more endurable, nay,\npleasant.And we began to laugh over our\nlost day which we had meant to begin by bathing in Housel Cove; truly,\njust to stand outside the door would give an admirable douche bath in\nthree minutes.\"But how nice it is to be inside, with a roof over our\nheads, and no necessity for travelling.Fancy the unfortunate tourists\nwho have fixed on to-day for visiting the Lizard!\"(Charles had told us\nthat Monday was a favourite day for excursions.)\"Fancy anybody being\nobliged to go out such weather as this!\"And in our deep pity for our fellow-creatures we forgot to pity\nourselves.Nor was there much pity needed; we had provided against emergencies,\nwith a good store of needlework and knitting, anything that would\npack in small compass, also a stock of unquestionably \"light\"\nliterature--paper-covered, double-columned, sixpenny volumes, inclosing\nan amount of enjoyment which those only can understand who are true\nlovers of Walter Scott.We had enough of him to last for a week of wet\ndays.And we had a one-volume Tennyson, all complete, and a \"Morte\nd'Arthur\"--Sir Thomas Malory's.On this literary provender we felt that\nas yet we should not starve.Also, some little fingers having a trifling turn for art, brought out\ntriumphantly a colour-box, pencils, and pictures.And the wall-paper\nbeing one of the very ugliest that ever eye beheld, we sought and\nobtained permission to adorn it with these, our _chefs-d'[oe]uvre_,\npasted at regular intervals.<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the hallway.Where we hope they still remain, for the\nedification of succeeding lodgers.We read the \"Idylls of the King\" all through, finishing with \"The\nPassing of Arthur,\" where the \"bold Sir Bedivere\" threw Excalibur into\nthe mere--which is supposed to be Dozmare Pool.Here King Arthur's\nfaithful lover was so melted--for the hundredth time--by the pathos\nof the story, and by many old associations, that the younger and\nmore practical minds grew scornful, and declared that probably King\nArthur had never existed at all--or if he had, was nothing but a rough\nbarbarian, unlike even the hero of Sir Thomas Malory, and far more\nunlike the noble modern gentleman of Tennyson's verse.Maybe: and yet,\nseeing that\n\n  \"'Tis better to have loved and lost\n  Than never to have loved at all,\"\n\nmay it not be better to have believed in an impossible ideal man, than\nto accept contentedly a low ideal, and worship blindly the worldly, the\nmean, or the base?<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.This topic furnished matter for so much hot argument, that, besides\ndoing a quantity of needlework, we succeeded in making our one wet day\nby no means the least amusing of our seventeen days in Cornwall.[Illustration: HAULING IN THE LINES.]Hour after hour we watched the rain--an even down-pour.In the midst\nof it we heard a rumour that Charles had been seen about the town, and\nsoon after he appeared at the door, hat in hand, soaked but smiling,\nto inquire for and sympathise with his ladies.Yes, he _had_ brought a\nparty to the Lizard that day!--unfortunate souls (or bodies), for there\ncould not have been a dry thread left on them!We gathered closer round\nour cosy fire; ate our simple dinner with keen enjoyment, and agreed\nthat after all we had much to be thankful for.In the afternoon the storm abated a little, and we thought we would\nseize the chance of doing some shopping, if there was a shop in Lizard\nTown.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.So we walked--I ought rather to say waded, for the road was\nliterally swimming--meeting not one living creature, except a family of\nyoung ducks, who, I need scarcely say, were enjoying supreme felicity.\"Yes, ladies, this is the sort of weather we have pretty well all\nwinter.Very little frost or snow, but rain and storm, and plenty of\nit.Also fogs; I've heard there's nothing anywhere like the fogs at the\nLizard.\"So said the woman at the post-office, which, except the serpentine\nshops, seemed to be the one emporium of commerce in the place.There we\ncould get all we wanted, and a good deal that we were very thankful we\ndid not want, of eatables, drinkables, and wearables.Also ornaments,\nchina vases, &c., of a kind that would have driven frantic any person\nof aesthetic tastes.Among them an active young Cornishman of about a\nyear old was meandering aimlessly, or with aims equally destructive\nto himself and the community.He all but succeeded in bringing down a\nrow of plates upon his devoted head, and then tied himself up, one fat\nfinger after another, in a ball of twine, upon which he began to howl\nviolently.\"He's a regular little trial,\" said the young mother proudly.\"He's\nonly sixteen months old, and yet he's up to all sorts of mischief.I\ndon't know what in the world I shall do with he, presently.\"Not naughty, only active,\" suggested another maternal spirit, and\npleaded that the young jackanapes should be found something to do that\nwas not mischief, but yet would occupy his energies, and fill his mind.At which, the bright bold face looked up as if he had understood it\nall--an absolutely fearless face, brimming with fun, and shrewdness\ntoo.The \"regular little trial\" may grow into a valuable\nmember of society--fisherman, sailor, coastguardman--daring and doing\nheroic deeds; perhaps saving many a life on nights such as last night,\nwhich had taught us what Cornish coast-life was all winter through.The storm was now gradually abating; the wind had lulled entirely, the\nrain had ceased, and by sunset a broad yellow streak all along the west\nimplied that it might possibly be a fine day to-morrow.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the office.But the lane was almost a river still, and the slippery altitudes of\nthe \"hedges\" were anything but desirable.As the only possible place\nfor a walk I ventured into a field where two or three cows cropped\ntheir supper of damp grass round one of those green hillocks seen in\nevery Cornish pasture field--a manure heap planted with cabbages, which\ngrow there with a luxuriance that turns ugliness into positive beauty.Very dreary everything was--the soaking grass, the leaden sky, the\nangry-looking sea, over which a rainy moon was just beginning to throw\na faint glimmer; while shorewards one could just trace the outline of\nLizard Point and the wheat-field behind it.Yesterday those fields had\nlooked so sunshiny and fair, but to-night they were all dull and grey,\nwith rows of black dots indicating the soppy, sodden harvest sheaves.Which reminded me that to-morrow was the harvest festival at\nLandewednack, when all the world and his wife was invited by shilling\ntickets to have tea in the rectory garden, and afterwards to assist at\nthe evening thanksgiving service in the church.some poor farmer might well exclaim,\nespecially on such a day as this.Some harvest festivals must\noccasionally seem a bitter mockery.Indeed, I doubt if the next\ngeneration will not be wise in taking our \"Prayers for Rain,\"\n\"Prayers for Fair Weather,\" clean out of the liturgy.Such conceited\nintermeddling with the government of the world sounds to some\nridiculous, to others actually profane.\"Snow and hail, mists and\nvapours, wind and storm, fulfilling His Word.\"And it must be\nfulfilled, no matter at what cost to individuals or to nations.The\nlaws of the universe must be carried out, even though the mystery\nof sorrow, like the still greater mystery of evil, remains for ever\nunexplained.\"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\"How marvellously beautiful He can make this\nworld!until we can hardly imagine anything more beautiful in the world\neverlasting.Ay, even after such a day as to-day, when the world seems\nhardly worth living in, yet we live on, live to wake up unto such a\nto-morrow--\n\nBut I must wait to speak of it in another page.DAY THE SIXTH\n\n\nAnd a day absolutely divine!Not a cloud upon the sky, not a ripple\nupon the water, or it appeared so in the distance.Nearer, no doubt,\nthere would have been that heavy ground-swell which is so long in\nsubsiding, in fact is scarcely ever absent on this coast.The land,\nlike the sea, was all one smile; the pasture fields shone in brilliant\ngreen, the cornfields gleaming yellow--at once a beauty and a\nthanksgiving.It was the very perfection of an autumn morning.We would not lose\nan hour of it, but directly after breakfast started leisurely to\nfind Housel Cove and try our first experiment of bathing in the wide\nAtlantic.Not a rood of land lay between us and\nAmerica.Yet the illimitable ocean \"where the great ships go down,\"\nrolled in to our feet in baby ripples<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the office.", "question": "Where is the apple?

on the contrary, he hasted\nto change the subject.\"The sun,\" he said, \"moves slowly on the index.After the painful\ninformation you have given me, I expected the Lords of my Council ere\nnow, to take order with the ravelled affairs of this unhappy riot.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.Evil\nwas the fortune which gave me rule over a people among whom it seems\nto me I am in my own person the only man who desires rest and\ntranquillity!\"\"The church always desires peace and tranquillity,\" added the prior,\nnot suffering even so general a proposition to escape the poor king's\noppressed mind without insisting on a saving clause for the church's\nhonour.\"But, father prior, you will\nallow that the church, in quelling strife, as is doubtless her purpose,\nresembles the busy housewife, who puts in motion the dust which she\nmeans to sweep away.\"To this remark the prior would have made some reply, but the door of\nthe apartment was opened, and a gentleman usher announced the Duke of\nAlbany.CHAPTER X.\n\n     Gentle friend,\n     Chide not her mirth, who was sad yesterday,\n     And may be so tomorrow.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.The Duke of Albany was, like his royal brother, named Robert.The\nChristian name of the latter had been John until he was called to the\nthrone; when the superstition of the times observed that the name\nhad been connected with misfortune in the lives and reigns of John of\nEngland, John of France, and John Baliol of Scotland.It was therefore\nagreed that, to elude the bad omen, the new king should assume the name\nof Robert, rendered dear to Scotland by the recollections of Robert\nBruce.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.We mention this to account for the existence of two brothers of\nthe same Christian name in one family, which was not certainly an usual\noccurrence, more than at the present day.Albany, also an aged man, was not supposed to be much more disposed for\nwarlike enterprise than the King himself.But if he had not courage, he\nhad wisdom to conceal and cloak over his want of that quality, which,\nonce suspected, would have ruined all the plans which his ambition had\nformed.He had also pride enough to supply, in extremity, the want\nof real valour, and command enough over his nerves to conceal their\nagitation.In other respects, he was experienced in the ways of courts,\ncalm, cool, and crafty, fixing upon the points which he desired to\nattain, while they were yet far removed, and never losing sight of them,\nthough the winding paths in which he trode might occasionally seem to\npoint to a different direction.In his person he resembled the King, for\nhe was noble and majestic both in stature and countenance.But he had\nthe advantage of his elder brother, in being unencumbered with any\ninfirmity, and in every respect lighter and more active.His dress was\nrich and grave, as became his age and rank, and, like his royal brother,\nhe wore no arms of any kind, a case of small knives supplying at his\ngirdle the place usually occupied by a dagger in absence of a sword.At the Duke's entrance the prior, after making an obeisance,\nrespectfully withdrew to a recess in the apartment, at some distance\nfrom the royal seat, in order to leave the conversation of the brothers\nuncontrolled by the presence of a third person.It is necessary to\nmention, that the recess was formed by a window; placed in the inner\nfront of the monastic buildings, called the palace, from its being the\nfrequent residence of the Kings of Scotland, but which was, unless on\nsuch occasions, the residence of the prior or abbot.The window\nwas placed over the principal entrance to the royal apartments, and\ncommanded a view of the internal quadrangle of the convent, formed on\nthe right hand by the length of the magnificent church, on the left by\na building containing the range of cellars, with the refectory, chapter\nhouse, and other conventual apartments rising above them, for such\nexisted altogether independent of the space occupied by King Robert and\nhis attendants; while a fourth row of buildings, showing a noble\noutward front to the rising sun, consisted of a large hospitium, for\nthe reception of strangers and pilgrims, and many subordinate offices,\nwarehouses, and places of accommodation, for the ample stores which\nsupplied the magnificent hospitality of the Dominican fathers.A lofty\nvaulted entrance led through this eastern front into the quadrangle,\nand was precisely opposite to the window at which Prior Anselm stood, so\nthat he could see underneath the dark arch, and observe the light which\ngleamed beneath it from the eastern and open portal; but, owing to the\nheight to which he was raised, and the depth of the vaulted archway, his\neye could but indistinctly reach the opposite and extended portal.It is\nnecessary to notice these localities.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the office.We return to the conversation between the princely relatives.\"My dear brother,\" said the King, raising the Duke of Albany, as\nhe stooped to kiss his hand--\"my dear, dear brother, wherefore this\nceremonial?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the kitchen.Are we not both sons of the same Stuart of Scotland and of\nthe same Elizabeth More?\"\"I have not forgot that it is so,\" said Albany, arising; \"but I must not\nomit, in the familiarity of the brother, the respect that is due to the\nking.\"\"Oh, true--most true, Robin,\" answered the King.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.\"The throne is like a\nlofty and barren rock, upon which flower or shrub can never take root.All kindly feelings, all tender affections, are denied to a monarch.A king must not fold a brother to his heart--he dare not give way to\nfondness for a son.\"\"Such, in some respects, is the doom of greatness, sire,\" answered\nAlbany; \"but Heaven, who removed to some distance from your Majesty's\nsphere the members of your own family, has given you a whole people to\nbe your children.\"Robert,\" answered the monarch, \"your heart is better framed for\nthe duties of a sovereign than mine.I see from the height at which fate\nhas placed me that multitude whom you call my children.I love them, I\nwish them well; but they are many, and they are distant from me.even the meanest of them has some beloved being whom he can clasp to\nhis heart, and upon whom he can lavish the fondness of a father.But all\nthat a king can give to a people is a smile, such as the sun bestows\non the snowy peaks of the Grampian mountains, as distant and as\nineffectual.our father used to caress us, and if he chid\nus it was with a tone of kindness; yet he was a monarch as well as I,\nand wherefore should not I be permitted, like him, to reclaim my poor\nprodigal by affection as well as severity?\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.\"Had affection never been tried, my liege,\" replied Albany, in the tone\nof one who delivers sentiments which he grieves to utter, \"means of\ngentleness ought assuredly to be first made use of.Your Grace is best\njudge whether they have been long enough persevered in, and whether\nthose of discouragement and restraint may not prove a more effectual\ncorrective.It is exclusively in your royal power to take what measures\nwith the Duke of Rothsay you think will be most available to his\nultimate benefit, and that of the kingdom.\"\"This is unkind, brother,\" said the King: \"you indicate the painful path\nwhich you would have me pursue, yet you offer me not your support in\ntreading it.\"\"My support your Grace may ever command,\" replied Albany; \"but would it\nbecome me, of all men on earth, to prompt to your Grace severe measures\nagainst your son and heir?Me, on whom, in case of failure--which Heaven\nforefend!--of your Grace's family, this fatal crown might descend?Would\nit not be thought and said by the fiery March and the haughty Douglas,\nthat Albany had sown dissension between his royal brother and the heir\nto the Scottish throne, perhaps to clear the way for the succession of\nhis own family?No, my liege, I can sacrifice my life to your service,\nbut I must not place my honour in danger.\"\"You say true, Robin.--you say very true,\" replied the King, hastening\nto put his own interpretation upon his brother's words.\"We must not\nsuffer these powerful and dangerous lords to perceive that there is\naught like discord in the royal family.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the milk there.That must be avoided of all\nthings: and therefore we will still try indulgent measures, in hopes\nof correcting the follies of Rothsay.I behold sparks of hope in\nhim, Robin, from time to time, that are well worth cherishing.He is\nyoung--very young--a prince, and in the heyday of his blood.We will\nhave patience with him, like a good rider with a hot tempered horse.Let\nhim exhaust this idle humor, and no one will be better pleased with\nhim than yourself.You have censured me in your kindness for being too\ngentle, too retired; Rothsay has no such defects.\"\"I will pawn my life he has not,\" replied Albany, drily.\"And he wants not reflection as well as spirit,\" continued the poor\nking, pleading the cause of his son to his brother.\"I have sent for him\nto attend council today, and we shall see how he acquits himself of\nhis devoir.You yourself allow, Robin, that the Prince wants neither\nshrewdness nor capacity for affairs, when he is in the humor to consider\nthem.\"\"Doubtless, he wants neither, my liege,\" replied Albany, \"when he is in\nthe humor to consider them.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.\"I say so,\" answered the King; \"and am heartily glad that you agree with\nme, Robin, in giving this poor hapless young man another trial.He has\nno mother now to plead his cause with an incensed father.\"I trust,\" said Albany, \"the course which is most agreeable to your\nGrace's feelings will also prove the wisest and the best.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.The Duke well saw the simple stratagem by which the King was\nendeavouring to escape from the conclusions of his reasoning, and\nto adopt, under pretence of his sanction, a course of proceeding the\nreverse of what it best suited him to recommend.But though he saw he\ncould not guide his brother to the line of conduct he desired, he would\nnot abandon the reins, but resolved to watch for a fitter opportunity of\nobtaining the sinister advantages to which new quarrels betwixt the King\nand Prince were soon, he thought, likely to give rise.In the mean time, King Robert, afraid lest his brother should resume\nthe painful subject from which he had just escaped, called aloud to the\nprior of the Dominicans, \"I hear the trampling of horse.Your station\ncommands the courtyard, reverend father.Look from the window, and tell\nus who alights.\"The noble Earl of March, with his followers,\" said the prior.At the same moment, Albany whispered the King, \"Fear nothing, the\nBrandanes of your household are under arms.\"The King nodded thanks, while the prior from the window answered the\nquestion he had put.\"The Earl is attended by two pages, two gentlemen,\nand four grooms.One page follows him up the main staircase, bearing his\nlordship's sword.The others halt in the court, and--Benedicite, how is\nthis?Here is a strolling glee woman, with her viol, preparing to sing\nbeneath the royal windows, and in the cloister of the Dominicans, as\nshe might in the yard of an hostelrie!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.\"Let me implore grace for the poor\nwanderer.The joyous science, as they call it, which they profess,\nmingles sadly with the distresses to which want and calamity condemn a\nstrolling race; and in that they resemble a king, to whom all men cry,\n'All hail!'while he lacks the homage and obedient affection which\nthe poorest yeoman receives from his family.Let the wanderer remain\nundisturbed, father; and let her sing if she will to the yeomen and\ntroopers in the court; it will keep them from quarrelling with each\nother, belonging, as they do, to such unruly and hostile masters.\"So spoke the well meaning and feeble minded prince, and the prior bowed\nin acquiescence.As he spoke, the Earl of March entered the hall of\naudience, dressed in the ordinary riding garb of the time, and wearing\nhis poniard.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.He had left in the anteroom the page of honour who carried\nhis sword.The Earl was a well built, handsome man, fair complexioned,\nwith a considerable profusion of light  hair, and bright\nblue eyes, which gleamed like those of a falcon.He exhibited in his\ncountenance, otherwise pleasing, the marks of a hasty and irritable\ntemper, which his situation as a high and powerful feudal lord had given\nhim but too many opportunities of indulging.\"I am glad to see you, my Lord of March,\" said the King, with a\ngracious inclination of his person.\"You have been long absent from our\ncouncils.\"\"My liege,\" answered March with a deep reverence to the King, and a\nhaughty and formal inclination to the Duke of Albany, \"if I have been\nabsent from your Grace's councils, it is because my place has been\nsupplied by more acceptable, and, I doubt not, abler, counsellors.And\nnow I come but to say to your Highness, that the news from the English\nfrontier make it necessary that I should return without delay to my\nown estates.Your Grace has your wise and politic brother, my Lord of\nAlbany, with whom to consult,<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.", "question": "Where is the apple?

Warden of the Eastern\nMarches.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.\"You will not deal so unkindly with us, cousin,\" replied the gentle\nmonarch.\"Here are evil tidings on the wind.These unhappy Highland\nclans are again breaking into general commotion, and the tranquillity\neven of our own court requires the wisest of our council to advise, and\nthe bravest of our barons to execute, what may be resolved upon.The\ndescendant of Thomas Randolph will not surely abandon the grandson of\nRobert Bruce at such a period as this?\"\"I leave with him the descendant of the far famed James of Douglas,\"\nanswered March.\"It is his lordship's boast that he never puts foot in\nstirrup but a thousand horse mount with him as his daily lifeguard, and\nI believe the monks of Aberbrothock will swear to the fact.Surely, with\nall the Douglas's chivalry, they are fitter to restrain a disorderly\nswarm of Highland kerne than I can be to withstand the archery of\nEngland and power of Henry Hotspur?And then, here is his Grace of\nAlbany, so jealous in his care of your Highness's person, that he\ncalls your Brandanes to take arms when a dutiful subject like myself\napproaches the court with a poor half score of horse, the retinue of\nthe meanest of the petty barons who own a tower and a thousand acres\nof barren heath.When such precautions are taken where there is not the\nslightest chance of peril--since I trust none was to be apprehended from\nme--your royal person will surely be suitably guarded in real danger.\"\"My Lord of March,\" said the Duke of Albany, \"the meanest of the barons\nof whom you speak put their followers in arms even when they receive\ntheir dearest and nearest friends within the iron gate of their castle;\nand, if it please Our Lady, I will not care less for the King's person\nthan they do for their own.The Brandanes are the King's immediate\nretainers and household servants, and an hundred of them is but a small\nguard round his Grace, when yourself, my lord, as well as the Earl of\nDouglas, often ride with ten times the number.\"\"My Lord Duke,\" replied March, \"when the service of the King requires\nit, I can ride with ten times as many horse as your Grace has named;\nbut I have never done so either traitorously to entrap the King nor\nboastfully to overawe other nobles.\"\"Brother Robert,\" said the King, ever anxious to be a peacemaker, \"you\ndo wrong even to intimate a suspicion of my Lord of March.And you,\ncousin of March, misconstrue my brother's caution.But hark--to divert\nthis angry parley--I hear no unpleasing touch of minstrelsy.You know\nthe gay science, my Lord of March, and love it well.Step to yonder\nwindow, beside the holy prior, at whom we make no question touching\nsecular pleasures, and you will tell us if the music and play be worth\nlistening to.My brother of Albany's\njudgment is not worth a cockle shell in such matters, so you, cousin,\nmust report your opinion whether the poor glee maiden deserves\nrecompense.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Our son and the Douglas will presently be here, and then,\nwhen our council is assembled, we will treat of graver matters.\"With something like a smile on his proud brow, March withdrew into the\nrecess of the window, and stood there in silence beside the prior, like\none who, while he obeyed the King's command, saw through and despised\nthe timid precaution which it implied, as an attempt to prevent the\ndispute betwixt Albany and himself.The tune, which was played upon a\nviol, was gay and sprightly in the commencement, with a touch of the\nwildness of the troubadour music.But, as it proceeded, the faltering\ntones of the instrument, and of the female voice which accompanied it,\nbecame plaintive and interrupted, as if choked by the painful feelings\nof the minstrel.The offended earl, whatever might be his judgment in such matters on\nwhich the King had complimented him, paid, it may be supposed, little\nattention to the music of the female minstrel.His proud heart was\nstruggling between the allegiance he owed his sovereign, as well as\nthe love he still found lurking in his bosom for the person of his well\nnatured king, and a desire of vengeance arising out of his disappointed\nambition, and the disgrace done to him by the substitution of Marjory\nDouglas to be bride of the heir apparent, instead of his betrothed\ndaughter.March had the vices and virtues of a hasty and uncertain\ncharacter, and even now, when he came to bid the King adieu, with the\npurpose of renouncing his allegiance as soon as he reached his own\nfeudal territories, he felt unwilling, and almost unable, to resolve\nupon a step so criminal and so full of peril.It was with such dangerous\ncogitations that he was occupied during the beginning of the glee\nmaiden's lay; but objects which called his attention powerfully, as the\nsongstress proceeded, affected the current of his thoughts, and riveted\nthem on what was passing in the courtyard of the monastery.The song was\nin the Provencal dialect, well understood as the language of poetry\nin all the courts of Europe, and particularly in Scotland.It was more\nsimply turned, however, than was the general cast of the sirventes,\nand rather resembled the lai of a Norman minstrel.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the hallway.It may be translated\nthus:\n\n     The Lay of Poor Louise.The livelong day\n     She roams from cot to castle gay;\n     And still her voice and viol say,\n     Ah, maids, beware the woodland way;\n     Think on Louise.The sun was high;\n     It smirch'd her cheek, it dimm'd her eye.The woodland walk was cool and nigh,\n     Where birds with chiming streamlets vie\n     To cheer Louise.The savage bear\n     Made ne'er that lovely grove his lair;\n     The wolves molest not paths so fair.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the apple there.But better far had such been there\n     For poor Louise.In woody wold\n     She met a huntsman fair and bold;\n     His baldrick was of silk and gold,\n     And many a witching tale he told\n     To poor Louise.Small cause to pine\n     Hadst thou for treasures of the mine;\n     For peace of mind, that gift divine,\n     And spotless innocence, were thine.I know not if by force or theft,\n     Or part by violence, part by gift;\n     But misery is all that's left\n     To poor Louise,\n\n     Let poor Louise some succour have!She will not long your bounty crave,\n     Or tire the gay with warning stave;\n     For Heaven has grace, and earth a grave\n     For poor Louise.The song was no sooner finished than, anxious lest the dispute should be\nrevived betwixt his brother and the Earl of March, King Robert called to\nthe latter, \"What think you of the minstrelsy, my lord?Methinks, as I\nheard it even at this distance, it was a wild and pleasing lay.\"\"My judgment is not deep my lord; but the singer may dispense with\nmy approbation, since she seems to have received that of his Grace of\nRothsay, the best judge in Scotland.\"said the King in alarm; \"is my son below?\"\"He is sitting on horseback by the glee maiden,\" said March, with a\nmalicious smile on his cheek, \"apparently as much interested by her\nconversation as her music.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary dropped the apple.\"I have no will to see, my\nlord, things which it would pain me to repeat.\"said the King, who  deeply, and seemed about\nto rise from his chair; but changed his mind, as if unwilling, perhaps,\nto look upon some unbecoming prank of the wild young prince, which he\nmight not have had heart to punish with necessary severity.The Earl\nof March seemed to have a pleasure in informing him of that of which\ndoubtless he desired to remain ignorant.\"My liege,\" he cried, \"this is better and better.The glee maiden has\nnot only engaged the ear of the Prince of Scotland, as well as of every\ngroom and trooper in the courtyard, but she has riveted the attention of\nthe Black Douglas, whom we have not known as a passionate admirer of\nthe gay science.But truly, I do not wonder at his astonishment, for the\nPrince has honoured the fair professor of song and viol with a kiss of\napprobation.\"cried the King, \"is David of Rothsay trifling with a glee maiden,\nand his wife's father in presence?Go, my good father abbot, call the\nPrince here instantly.Go, my dearest brother--\" And when they had both\nleft the room, the King continued, \"Go, good cousin of March; there will\nbe mischief, I am assured of it.I pray you go, cousin, and second my\nlord prior's prayers with my commands.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the milk there.\"You forget, my liege,\" said March, with the voice of a deeply offended\nperson, \"the father of Elizabeth of Dunbar were but an unfit intercessor\nbetween the Douglas and his royal son in law.\"\"I crave your pardon, cousin,\" said the gentle old man.\"I own you have\nhad some wrong; but my Rothsay will be murdered--I must go myself.\"But, as he arose precipitately from his chair, the poor king missed a\nfootstep, stumbled, and fell heavily to the ground, in such a manner\nthat, his head striking the corner of the seat from which he had risen,\nhe became for a minute insensible.The sight of the accident at once\novercame March's resentment and melted his heart.He ran to the fallen\nmonarch, and replaced him in his seat, using, in the tenderest and most\nrespectful manner, such means as seemed most fit to recall animation.Robert opened his eyes, and gazed around with uncertainty.\"What has\nhappened?--are we alone?--who is with us?\"\"Your dutiful subject, March,\" replied the Earl.repeated the King, his still disturbed\nintellect receiving some alarm from the name of a powerful chief whom he\nhad reason to believe he had mortally offended.\"Yes, my gracious liege, with poor George of Dunbar, of whom many have\nwished your Majesty to think ill, though he will be found truer to your\nroyal person at the last than they will.\"\"Indeed, cousin, you have had too much wrong; and believe me, we shall\nstrive to redress--\"\n\n\"If your Grace thinks so, it may yet be righted,\" interrupted the Earl,\ncatching at the hopes which his ambition suggested: \"the Prince and\nMarjory Douglas are nearly related--the dispensation from Rome was\ninformally granted--their marriage cannot be lawful--the Pope, who will\ndo much for so godly a prince, can set aside this unchristian union, in\nrespect of the pre-contract.Bethink you well, my liege,\" continued\nthe Earl, kindling with a new train of ambitious thoughts, to which\nthe unexpected opportunity of pleading his cause personally had given\nrise--\"bethink you how you choose betwixt the Douglas and me.He is\npowerful and mighty, I grant.But George of Dunbar wears the keys of\nScotland at his belt, and could bring an English army to the gates of\nEdinburgh ere Douglas could leave the skirts of Carintable to oppose\nthem.Your royal son loves my poor deserted girl, and hates the haughty\nMarjory of Douglas.Your Grace may judge the small account in which he\nholds her by his toying with a common glee maiden even in the presence\nof her father.\"The King had hitherto listened to the Earl's argument with the\nbewildered feelings of a timid horseman, borne away by an impetuous\nsteed, whose course he can neither arrest nor direct.But the last words\nawakened in his recollection the sense of his son's immediate danger.\"Oh, ay, most true--my son--the Douglas!Oh, my dear cousin, prevent\nblood, and all shall be as you will.Hark, there is a tumult--that was\nthe clash of arms!\"\"By my coronet, by my knightly faith, it is true!\"said the Earl,\nlooking from the window upon the inner square of the convent, now filled\nwith armed men and brandished weapons, and resounding with the clash\nof armour.The deep vaulted entrance was crowded with warriors at its\nfarthest extremity, and blows seemed to be in the act of being exchanged\nbetwixt some who were endeavouring to shut the gate and others who\ncontended to press in.\"I will go instantly,\" said the Earl of March, \"and soon quell this\nsudden broil.Humbly I pray your Majesty to think on what I have had the\nboldness to propose.\"\"I will--I will, fair cousin,\" said the King, scarce knowing to what he\npledged himself; \"do but prevent tumult and bloodshed!\"CHAPTER XI\n\n     Fair is the damsel, passing fair;\n     Sunny at distance gleams her smile;\n     Approach--the cloud of woful care\n     Hangs trembling in her eye the while.We must here trace a little more correctly the events which had been\nindistinctly seen from the window of the royal apartments, and yet more\nindistinctly reported by those who witnessed them.The glee maiden,\nalready mentioned, had planted herself where a rise of two large broad\nsteps, giving access to the main gateway of the royal apartments, gained\nher an advantage of a foot and a half in height over those in the\ncourt, of whom she hoped to form an audience.She wore the dress of her\ncalling, which was more gaudy than rich, and showed the person more than\ndid the garb of other females.She had laid aside an upper mantle, and\na small basket which contained her slender stock of necessaries; and a\nlittle French spaniel dog sat beside them, as their protector.An azure\nblue jacket, embroidered with silver, and sitting close to the person,\nwas open in front, and showed several waistcoats of different \nsilks, calculated to set off the symmetry of the shoulders and bosom,\nand remaining open at the throat.A small silver chain worn around her\nneck involved itself amongst these brilliant  waistcoats, and\nwas again produced from them; to display a medal of the same metal,\nwhich intimated, in the name of some court or guild of minstrels,\nthe degree she had taken in the gay or joyous science.A small scrip,\nsuspended over her shoulders by a blue silk riband; hung on her left\nside.Her sunny complexion, snow white teeth, brilliant black eyes, and raven\nlocks marked her country lying far in the south of France, and the arch\nsmile and dimpled chin bore the same character.Her luxuriant raven\nlocks, twisted around a small gold bodkin, were kept in their position\nby a net of silk and gold.Short petticoats, deep laced with silver, to\ncorrespond with the jacket, red stockings which were visible so high as\nnear the calf of the leg, and buskins of Spanish leather, completed her\nadjustment, which, though far from new, had been saved as an untarnished\nholiday suit, which much care had kept in good order.She seemed about\ntwenty-five years old; but perhaps fatigue and wandering had anticipated\nthe touch of time in obliterating the freshness of early youth.We have said the glee maiden's manner was lively, and we may add that\nher smile and repartee were ready.But her gaiety was assumed, as a\nquality essentially necessary to her trade, of which it was one of the\nmiseries, that the professors were obliged frequently to cover an aching\nheart with a compelled smile.This seemed to be the case with Louise,\nwho, whether she was actually the heroine of her own song, or whatever\nother cause she might have for sadness, showed at times a strain of deep\nmelancholy thought, which interfered with and controlled the natural\nflow of lively spirits which the practice of the joyous science\nespecially required.She lacked also, even in her gayest sallies, the\ndecided boldness and effrontery of her sisterhood, who were seldom at", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>hallway"}, {"input": "It may be here remarked, that it was impossible that this class of\nwomen, very numerous in that age, could bear a character generally\nrespectable.They were, however, protected by the manners of the time;\nand such were the immunities they possessed by the rights of chivalry,\nthat nothing was more rare than to hear of such errant damsels\nsustaining injury or wrong, and they passed and repassed safely, where\narmed travellers would probably have encountered a bloody opposition.But though licensed and protected in honour of their tuneful art, the\nwandering minstrels, male or female, like similar ministers to the\npublic amusement, the itinerant musicians, for instance, and strolling\ncomedians of our own day, led a life too irregular and precarious to\nbe accounted a creditable part of society.Indeed, among the stricter\nCatholics, the profession was considered as unlawful.Such was the damsel who, with viol in hand, and stationed on the slight\nelevation we have mentioned, stepped forward to the bystanders and\nannounced herself as a mistress of the gay science, duly qualified by a\nbrief from a Court of Love and Music held at Aix, in Provence, under the\ncountenance of the flower of chivalry, the gallant Count Aymer; who now\nprayed that the cavaliers of merry Scotland, who were known over the\nwide world for bravery and courtesy, would permit a poor stranger to try\nwhether she could afford them any amusement by her art.The love of song\nwas like the love of fight, a common passion of the age, which all\nat least affected, whether they were actually possessed by it or no;\ntherefore the acquiescence in Louise's proposal was universal.At\nthe same time, an aged, dark browed monk who was among the bystanders\nthought it necessary to remind the glee maiden that, since she was\ntolerated within these precincts, which was an unusual grace, he trusted\nnothing would be sung or said inconsistent with the holy character of\nthe place.The glee maiden bent her head low, shook her sable locks, and crossed\nherself reverentially, as if she disclaimed the possibility of such a\ntransgression, and then began the song of \"Poor Louise.\"which we gave\nat length in the last chapter.Just as she commenced, she was stopped by a cry of \"Room--room--place\nfor the Duke of Rothsay!\"\"Nay, hurry no man on my score,\" said a gallant young cavalier, who\nentered on a noble Arabian horse, which he managed with exquisite grace,\nthough by such slight handling of the reins, such imperceptible pressure\nof the limbs and sway of the body, that to any eye save that of an\nexperienced horseman the animal seemed to be putting forth his paces for\nhis own amusement, and thus gracefully bearing forward a rider who was\ntoo indolent to give himself any trouble about the matter.The Prince's apparel, which was very rich, was put on with slovenly\ncarelessness.His form, though his stature was low, and his limbs\nextremely slight, was elegant in the extreme; and his features no less\nhandsome.But there was on his brow a haggard paleness, which seemed\nthe effect of care or of dissipation, or of both these wasting causes\ncombined.His eyes were sunk and dim, as from late indulgence in revelry\non the preceding evening, while his cheek was inflamed with unnatural\nred, as if either the effect of the Bacchanalian orgies had not passed\naway from the constitution, or a morning draught had been resorted to,\nin order to remove the effects of the night's debauchery.Such was the Duke of Rothsay, and heir of the Scottish crown, a sight\nat once of interest and compassion.All unbonneted and made way for him,\nwhile he kept repeating carelessly, \"No haste--no haste: I shall arrive\nsoon enough at the place I am bound for.How's this--a damsel of the\njoyous science?Stand\nstill, my merry men; never was minstrelsy marred for me.Louise did not know the person who addressed her; but the general\nrespect paid by all around, and the easy and indifferent manner in which\nit was received, showed her she was addressed by a man of the highest\nquality.She recommenced her lay, and sung her best accordingly; while\nthe young duke seemed thoughtful and rather affected towards the close\nof the ditty.But it was not his habit to cherish such melancholy\naffections.\"This is a plaintive ditty, my nut brown maid,\" said he, chucking the\nretreating glee maiden under the chin, and detaining her by the collar\nof her dress, which was not difficult, as he sat on horseback so close\nto the steps on which she stood.\"But I warrant me you have livelier\nnotes at will, ma bella tenebrosa; ay, and canst sing in bower as well\nas wold, and by night as well as day.\"\"I am no nightingale, my lord,\" said Louise, endeavouring to escape a\nspecies of gallantry which ill suited the place and circumstances--a\ndiscrepancy to which he who addressed it to her seemed contemptuously\nindifferent.he added, removing his hold from her\ncollar to the scrip which she carried.Glad was Louise to escape his grasp, by slipping the knot of the riband,\nand leaving the little bag in the Prince's hand, as, retiring back\nbeyond his reach, she answered, \"Nuts, my lord, of the last season.\"The Prince pulled out a handful of nuts accordingly.they\nwill break thine ivory teeth, hurt thy pretty voice,\" said Rothsay,\ncracking one with his teeth, like a village schoolboy.\"They are not the walnuts of my own sunny clime, my lord,\" said Louise;\n\"but they hang low, and are within the reach of the poor.\"\"You shall have something to afford you better fare, poor wandering\nape,\" said the Duke, in a tone in which feeling predominated more than\nin the affected and contemptuous gallantry of his first address to the\nglee maiden.At this moment, as he turned to ask an attendant for his purse, the\nPrince encountered the stern and piercing look of a tall black man,\nseated on a powerful iron grey horse, who had entered the court with\nattendants while the Duke of Rothsay was engaged with Louise, and now\nremained stupefied and almost turned to stone by his surprise and anger\nat this unseemly spectacle.To this end the uncle would bring to bear his own influence and that\nof His Eminence, the Archbishop of Seville.The letter closed with an\ninvocation to the Saints and the ever-blessed Virgin.It was nominally from the Bishop of\nCartagena, although written, he well knew, by Wenceslas.His Reverence\nregretted that Jose had not come to him again before leaving\nCartagena.He deplored exceedingly the necessity of assigning him to\nso lowly a parish; but it was discipline.His tenure of the parish\nwould be a matter of probation.Assuming a penitent desire on the part\nof the priest to make reparation for past indiscretions, His Grace\nextended assurances of his support and tender consideration.And,\nregarding him still as a faithful son, he was setting forth herewith\ncertain instructions which Jose would zealously carry out, to the\nglory of the sacred Mother Church and the blessed Virgin, and to his\nown edification, to wit: In the matter of the confessional he must be\nunremittingly zealous, not failing to put such questions to the people\nof Simiti as would draw out their most secret thoughts.<|begin_of_text|>Mary picked up the football there.In the present\ncrisis it was especially necessary to learn their political views.Likewise, he must not fail to impress upon them the sin of concealing\nwealth, and of withholding contributions to the support of the\nglorious Mother.He, as priest of the parish, would be held personally\nresponsible for the collection of an adequate \"Peter's Pence,\" which\nmust be sent to Cartagena at frequent intervals for subsequent\nshipment to Rome.For all contributions he was to allow liberal\nplenary indulgences.In the matter of inciting zeal for the salvation\nof those unfortunate souls lingering in the torments of purgatory,\nJose must be unflagging.Each family in the parish should be\nconstantly admonished and threatened, if necessary, to have Masses\nsaid for their deceased members; and he must forward the proceeds from\nsuch Masses at once to Cartagena.No less important, he must keep\nconstantly before him the great fact that the hope of the blessed\nMother lay in her young.To this end he must see that all children in\nhis parish were in due time confirmed, and every effort made to have\nthe females sent to the convent of Mompox.To encourage his\nparishioners, he might assure them of His Reverence's tender regard\nfor them as his beloved children, and that he had certain special\nfavors to grant to them in due time.Also, that a statue of the\nVirgin, which had arrived from Rome, and which carried the most potent\nblessing of the Holy Father, was to be bestowed upon that church in\nthe diocese which within the next twelve months should contribute the\nlargest amount of Peter's Pence in proportion to population.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.This plan\nshould be especially attractive to the people of Simiti, as the town\nlay on the confines of a district renowned in the ancient annals for\nits mineral wealth.Herein, too, lay a great opportunity for the\npriest; and His Reverence rejoiced in the certain knowledge that he\nwould embrace it.Invoking the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the\nEver-Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph, His Grace awaited with interest\nthe priest's first report from the parish of Simiti.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.The letter fell like a wet blanket upon Jose, chilling him to the\nmarrow, for it revived with cruel poignancy the fact that he was still\na servant of Rome.In the past few happy days he had dwelt apart from\nthe world in the consciousness of a new heaven and a new earth,\nrevealed by Carmen.This sudden call to duty was like a summons from\nMephistopheles to the fulfillment of a forgotten pact.Beneath the specious kindliness of\nWenceslas lay sinister motives, he knew.But--a darker thought--did Wenceslas know of Carmen's existence?Could\nCartagena have received any intimation of his plans for her?<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football there.Refusal\nto comply with these instructions meant--he dared not think what!On\nthe other hand, strict compliance with them certainly was out of the\nquestion.As for Peter's Pence, what could the impoverished folk of this\ndecrepit town furnish!And yet, if a reasonable sum could only be\ncontributed at frequent intervals, would not the vampire Wenceslas\nrest content, at least for a while?Oh, for a fortune of his own, that\nhe might dump it all into the yawning maw of Holy Church, and thus\ngain a few years' respite for himself and Carmen!<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the hallway.Rosendo inquired, anxiously regarding the priest's\nstrained features.What could the man do or say, limited, hounded, and without resources?Could he force these simple people to buy Masses?Could he take their\nmoney on a pretext which he felt to be utterly false?Yet Cartagena\n_must_ be kept quiet at any hazard!\"Rosendo,\" he asked earnestly, \"when you had a priest in Simiti, did\nthe people have Masses offered for their dead?\"\"_Na_, Padre, we have little money for Masses,\" replied Rosendo\nsadly.\"At times--long ago--for my first wife, when she died without a\npriest, up in the Tigui country.I\ncouldn't see how Masses said by that drunken priest could please God,\nor make Him release souls from purgatory--and Padre Diego was drunk\nmost of the time.\"\"Rosendo, we _must_ send money to the Bishop in\nCartagena.I _must_ stay here--I _must_!<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.And I can stay only by\nsatisfying Wenceslas!If I can send him money he will think me too\nvaluable to remove.It is not the Church, Rosendo, but Wenceslas who\nis persecuting me.He is using the\nChurch for his own evil ends.But I--I\ncan't make these poor people buy Masses!And--but here, read his\nletter,\" thrusting it into Rosendo's hand.Rosendo shook his head thoughtfully, and a cloud had gathered over his\nstrong face when he returned the Bishop's letter to Jose.\"Padre, we will be hard pressed to support the church and you, without\nbuying Masses.There are about two hundred people here, perhaps fifty\nfamilies.Only a few can afford to pay\neven a _peso oro_ a month to the schoolmaster to have their children\ntaught.They may be able to give twenty _pesos_ a month to support you\nand the church.It seemed to Jose that his soul must burst under its limitations.\"Rosendo, let us take Carmen and flee!\"He lapsed into silence-shrouded despair.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.The sun dropped below the wooded hills, and Cantar-las-horas had sung\nhis weird vesper song.Dusk was thickening into night, though upon the\ndistant _Sierras_ a mellow glow still illumined the frosted peaks.Moments crept slowly through the enveloping silence.Then the mental gloom parted, and through it arose the great soul of\nthe black-faced man sitting beside the despairing priest.\"Padre\"--Rosendo spoke slowly and with deep emotion.Tears trickled\ndown his swart cheeks--\"I am no longer young.More than sixty years of\nhardship and heavy toil rest upon me.My parents--I have not told you\nthis--were slaves.They worked in the mines of Guamoco, under hard\nmasters.They lived in bamboo huts, and slept on the damp ground.At\nfour each morning, year after year, they were driven from their hard\nbeds and sent out to toil under the lash fourteen hours a day, washing\ngold from the streams.The gold went to the building of Cartagena's\nwalls, and to her Bishop, to buy idleness and luxury for him and his\nfat priests.When the war came it lasted thirteen years; but we drove\nthe Christian Spaniards into the sea!Then my father and mother went\nback to Guamoco; and there I was born.When I was old enough to use a\n_batea_ I, too, washed gold in the Tigui, and in the little streams so\nnumerous in that region.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.But they had been pretty well washed out\nunder the Spaniards; and so my father came down here and made a little\n_hacienda_ on the hills across the lake from Simiti.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Then he and my\npoor mother lay down and died, worn out with their long years of toil\nfor their cruel masters.\"He brushed the tears from his eyes; then resumed: \"The district of\nGuamoco gradually became deserted.Revolution after revolution broke\nout in this unhappy country, sometimes stirred up by the priests,\nsometimes by political agitators who tried to get control of the\nGovernment.The men and boys went to the wars, and were killed off.Guamoco was again swallowed up by the forest--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and sat some moments silent.\"I have been back there many times since, and often I have washed gold\nagain along the beautiful Tigui,\" he continued.\"But the awful\nloneliness of the jungle, and the memories of those gloomy days when I\ntoiled there as a boy, and the thoughts of my poor parents' sufferings\nunder the Spaniards, made me so sad that I could not stay.And then I\ngot too old for that kind of work, standing bent over in the cold\nmountain water all day long, swinging a _batea_ heavy with gravel.\"He paused again, and seemed to lose himself in the memory of those\ndark days.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.\"But there is still gold in the Tigui.It means hard\nwork--but I can do it.Padre, I will go back there and wash out gold\nfor you to send to the Bishop of Cartagena, that you may stay here and\nprotect and teach the little Carmen.Perhaps in time I can wash", "question": "Where is the football?

but it was decided that no further explanation should be made\nthan that he was again going to prospect in the mineral districts\nalready so familiar to him.As Rosendo had said, this venture,\ntogether with the unannounced and unsolicited presence of the priest\nin the town, could not but excite extreme curiosity and raise the most\nlively conjectures, which might, in time, reach Wenceslas.On the\nother hand, if success attended his efforts, it was more than probable\nthat Cartagena would remain quiet, as long as her itching palm was\nbrightened with the yellow metal which he hoped to wrest from the\nsands of Guamoco.\"It is only a chance, Padre,\" Rosendo said\ndubiously.\"In the days of the Spaniards the river sands of Guamoco\nproduced from two to ten _reales_ a day to each slave.But the rivers\nhave been almost washed out.\"A Spanish _real_ was equivalent\nto half a franc.Then ten _reales_ would amount to five francs, the\nvery best he could hope for as a day's yield.\"And my supplies and the support of the senora and Carmen must come\nout of that,\" Rosendo added.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.\"Besides, I must pay Juan for working the\n_hacienda_ across the lake for me while I am away.\"Possibly ten _pesos oro_, or forty francs, might remain at the end of\neach month for them to send to Cartagena.Jose sighed heavily as he\nbusied himself with the preparations.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the kitchen.\"I got these supplies from Don Mario on credit, Padre,\" explained\nRosendo.<|begin_of_text|>John picked up the milk there.\"I thought best to buy from him to prevent making him angry.I have coffee, _panela_, rice, beans, and tobacco for a month.He was\nvery willing to let me have them--but do you know why?He wants me to\ngo up there and fail.Then he will have me in his debt, and I become\nhis _peon_--and I would never be anything after that but his slave,\nfor never again would he let me get out of debt to him.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Jose shuddered at the thought of the awful system of peonage prevalent\nin these Latin countries, an inhuman custom only a degree removed from\nthe slavery of colonial times.This venture was, without doubt, a\ndesperate risk.But it was for Carmen--and its expediency could not be\nquestioned.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Jose penned a letter to the Bishop of Cartagena that morning, and\nsent it by Juan to Bodega Central to await the next down-river\nsteamer.He did not know that Juan carried another letter for the\nBishop, and addressed in the flowing hand of the Alcalde.Jose\nbriefly acknowledged the Bishop's communication, and replied that he\nwould labor unflaggingly to uplift his people and further their\nspiritual development.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.As to the Bishop's instructions, he would\nendeavor to make Simiti's contribution to the support of Holy\nChurch, both material and spiritual, fully commensurate with the\npopulation.He did not touch on the other instructions, but closed\nwith fervent assurances of his intention to serve his little flock\nwith an undivided heart.Carmen received no lesson that day, and\nher rapidly flowing questions anent the unusual activity in the\nhousehold were met with the single explanation that her padre\nRosendo had found it necessary to go up to the Tigui river, a\njourney which some day she might perhaps take with him.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the office.During the afternoon Jose wrote two more letters, one to his uncle,\nbriefly announcing his appointment to the parish of Simiti, and his\nalready lively interest in his new field; the other to his beloved\nmother, in which he only hinted at the new-found hope which served as\nhis pillow at night.He did not mention Carmen, for fear that his\nletter might be opened ere it left Cartagena.But in tenderest\nexpressions of affection, and regret that he had been the unwitting\ncause of his mother's sorrow, he begged her to believe that his life\nhad received a stimulus which could not but result in great happiness\nfor them both, for he was convinced that he had at last found his\n_metier_, even though among a lowly people and in a sequestered part\nof the world.He hoped again to be reunited to her--possibly she might\nsome day meet him in Cartagena.And until then he would always hold\nher in tenderest love and the brightest and purest thought.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.He brushed aside the tears as he folded this letter; and, lest regret\nand self-condemnation seize him again, hurried forth in search of\nCarmen, whose radiance always dispelled his gloom as the rushing dawn\nshatters the night.She was not in Rosendo's house, and Dona Maria said she had seen the\nchild some time before going in the direction of the \"shales.\"These\nwere broad beds of rock to the south of town, much broken and deeply\nfissured, and so glaringly hot during most of the day as to be\nimpassable.Thither Jose bent his steps, and at length came upon the\ngirl sitting in the shade of a stunted _algarroba_ tree some distance\nfrom the usual trail.\"Well, what are you doing here, little one?\"\"I was thinking, Padre,\" she\nmade slow reply.\"But do you have to go away from home to think?\"\"I wanted to be alone; and there was so much going on in the house\nthat I came out here.\"\"And what have you been thinking about, Carmen?\"pursued Jose,\nsuspecting that her presence in the hot shale beds held some deeper\nsignificance than she had as yet revealed.\"I--I was just thinking that God is everywhere,\" she faltered.\"That He is where padre Rosendo is going, and that He will take care\nof him up there, and bring him back to Simiti again.\"\"And were you asking Him to do it, little one?\"\"No, Padre; I was just _knowing_ that He would.\"The little lip quivered, and the brown eyes were wet with tears.But\nJose could see that faith had conquered, whatever the struggle might\nhave been.The child evidently had sought solitude, that she might\nmost forcibly bring her trust in God to bear upon the little problem\nconfronting her--that she might make the certainty of His immanence\nand goodness destroy in her thought every dark suggestion of fear or\ndoubt.\"God will take care of him, won't He, Padre?\"Jose had taken her hand and was leading her back to the house.\"You have said it, child; and I believe you are a law unto yourself,\"\nwas the priest's low, earnest reply.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.The child smiled up at him; and\nJose knew he had spoken truth.That evening, the preparations for departure completed, Rosendo and\nJose took their chairs out before the house, where they sat late, each\nloath to separate lest some final word be left unsaid.The tepid\nevening melted into night, which died away in a deep silence that hung\nwraith-like over the old town.Myriad stars rained their shimmering\nlustre out of the unfathomable vault above.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the office.\"_Un canasto de flores_,\" mused Rosendo, looking off into the infinite\nblue.\"A basket of flowers, indeed,\" responded Jose reverently.\"Padre--\" Rosendo's brain seemed to struggle with a tremendous\nthought--\"I often try to think of what is beyond the stars; and I\ncannot.\"But, if we could get out to the last star--what then?\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bathroom.\"Still no end, no limit,\" replied Jose.\"And they are very far away--how far, Padre?\"\"You would not comprehend, even if I could tell you, Rosendo.Others so far that\ntheir light reaches us only after the lapse of centuries.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Light from those stars above us travels nearly two hundred\nthousand miles a second--\"\n\n\"_Hombre!_\" ejaculated the uncomprehending Rosendo.\"And yet, even at that awful rate of speed, it is probable that there\nare many stars whose light has not yet reached the earth since it\nbecame inhabited by men.\"\"_Caramba!_\"\n\n\"You may well say so, friend.\"\"But, Padre--does the light never stop?When does it reach an end--a\nstopping-place?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the kitchen.Go whichever way you will, you can never reach an end.\"Rosendo's brow knotted with puzzled wonder: Even Jose's own mind\nstaggered anew at its concept of the immeasurable depths of space.\"But, Padre, if we could go far enough up we would get to heaven,\nwouldn't we?\"\"And if we went far enough down we\nwould reach purgatory, and then hell, is it not so?\"He dared not answer lest he reveal his\nown paucity of ideas regarding these things.Happily the loquacious\nRosendo continued without waiting for reply.\"Padre Simon used to say when I was a child that the red we saw in the\nsky at sunset was the reflection of the flames of hell; so I have\nalways thought that hell was below us--perhaps in the center of the\nearth.\"For a time his simple mind mused over this puerile idea.Then--\n\n\"What do you suppose God looks like, Padre?\"Jose's thought flew back to the galleries and chapels of Europe, where\nthe masters have so often portrayed their ideas of God in the shape of\nan old, gray-haired man, partly bald, and with long, flowing beard.how pitifully crude, how lamentably impotent such childish\nconcepts.For they saw in God only their own frailties infinitely\nmagnified.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.Small wonder that they lived and died in spiritual gloom!\"Padre,\" Rosendo went on, \"if there is no limit to the universe, then\nit is--\"\n\n\"Infinite in extent, Rosendo,\" finished Jose.\"Then whoever made it is infinite, too,\" Rosendo added hypothetically.\"An infinite effect implies an infinite cause--yes, certainly,\" Jose\nanswered.\"So, if God made the universe, He is infinite, is He not, Padre?\"\"Then He can't be at all like us,\" was the logical conclusion.And\nscientists agree that it is infinite in extent.Its creator therefore\nmust be infinite in extent.And as the universe continues to exist,\nthat which called it into being, and still maintains it, must likewise\ncontinue to exist.\"Padre, what holds the stars in place?\"Rosendo's questions were as\npersistent as a child's.\"They are held in place by laws, Rosendo,\" the priest replied\nevasively.But as he made answer he revolved in his own mind that the\nlaws by which an infinite universe is created and maintained must\nthemselves be infinite.But, the priest mused, a power great enough to frame infinite laws\nmust be itself all-powerful.And if it has ever been all-powerful, it\ncould never cease to be so, for there could be nothing to deprive it\nof its power.Or, what is the\nsame thing, is all-inclusive.<|begin_of_text|>John put down the milk there.But laws originate, even as among human beings, in mind, for a law is\na mental thing.So the infinite laws which bind the stars together,\nand by which the universe was designed and is still maintained, could\nhave originated only in a mind, and that one infinite.\"Then God surely must know everything,\" commented Rosendo, by way of\nsimple and satisfying conclusion.Certainly the creator of an infinite universe--a universe, moreover,\nwhich reveals intelligence and knowledge on the part of its cause--the\noriginator of infinite laws, which reveal omnipotence in their\nmaker--must have all knowledge, all wisdom, at his command.But, on\nthe other hand, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, are ever mental\nthings.<|begin_of_text|>John left the apple.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the garden.What could embrace these things, and by them create an\ninfinite universe, but an infinite _mind_?Jose's thought reverted to Cardinal Newman's reference to God as \"an\ninitial principle.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the hallway.Surely the history of the universe reveals the\npatent fact that, despite the mutations of time, despite growth,\nmaturity, and decay, despite \"the wreck of matter and the crash of\nworlds,\" _something_ endures.Yes, the mind which is the _anima mundi_, the\nprinciple, of all things.\"But if He is so great, Padre, and knows everything, I don't see why\nHe made the devil,\" continued Rosendo; \"for the devil fights against\nHim all the time.\"A mind so pure as yours should\ngive no heed to thoughts of Satan.And the man at your side is now too\ndeeply buried in the channels which run below the superficiality of\nthe world's thought to hear your childish question.The cause of\nan infinite effect must itself be infinite.The framer of infinite\nlaws must be an infinite mind.And an infinite mind must contain all\nknowledge, and have all power.But were it to contain any seeds or\ngerms of decay, or any elements of discord--in a word, any evil--it\nmust disintegrate.Verily, to be\neternal and perfect _it must be wholly good_!<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bedroom.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.\"And so,\" the priest\nmused aloud, \"we call it God.\"But, he continued to reflect, when we accept the conclusion that the\nun", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.The minds of men\nmanifest themselves continually, and the manifestation is in mental\nprocesses and things.Mental activity results in the unfolding of\nideas.Does the activity of an infinite mind differ in this respect?And, if not, can the universe be other than a mental thing?For, if an\ninfinite mind created a universe, it must have done so _by the\nunfolding of its own ideas_!And, remaining infinite, filling all\nspace, this mind must ever continue to contain those ideas.And the\nuniverse--the creation--is mental.The burden of thought oppressed the priest, and he got up from his\nchair and paced back and forth before the house.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.But still his\nsearching mind burrowed incessantly, as if it would unearth a living\nthing that had been buried since the beginning.In order to fully express itself, an infinite mind would have to\nunfold an infinite number and variety of ideas.And this unfolding\nwould go on forever, since an infinite number is never reached.This\nis \"creation,\" and it could never terminate.\"Rosendo,\" said Jose, returning to his chair, \"you have asked what\nGod looks like.I cannot say, for God must be mind, unlimited mind.He\nhas all knowledge and wisdom, as well as all power.He is necessarily\neternal--has always existed, and always will, for He is entirely\nperfect and harmonious, without the slightest trace or taint of\ndiscord or evil.\"\"Then you think He does not look like us?\"\"Mind does not look like a human body, Rosendo.And an infinite cause\ncan be infinite only by being mind, not body.Moreover, He is\nunchanging--for He could not change and remain eternal.Carmen insists\nthat He is everywhere.To be always present He must be what the Bible\nsays He is spirit.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the garden.Or, what is the same thing, mind.Rosendo, He\nmanifests Himself everywhere and in everything--there is no other\nconclusion admissible.And to be eternal He has got to be _absolutely\ngood_!\"<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the kitchen.\"But, Padre,\" persisted Rosendo, \"who made the devil?\"\"God is infinite good, and there\ncan be no real evil.\"\"But how do you know that, Padre?\"\"I can't say how I know it--it reasons out that way logically.I think\nI begin to see the light.Can you not see that for some reason Carmen\ndoesn't admit the existence of evil?And you know, and I know, that\nshe is on the right track.I have followed the opposite path all my\nlife; and it led right into the slough of despond.Now I have turned,\nand am trying to follow her.And do you put the thought of Satan out\nof your mentality and do likewise.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.\"But, the Virgin Mary--she has power with God?\"Rosendo's primitive\nideas were in a hopeless tangle.\"Good friend, forget the Virgin Mary,\" said Jose gently, laying his\nhand on Rosendo's arm._Hombre!_ Why--she has all power--she works miracles\nevery hour--she directs the angels--gives commands to God himself!Padre Simon said she was the absolute mistress of heaven and earth,\nand that men and animals, the plants, the winds, all health, sickness,\nlife and death, depended upon her will!<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the garden.He said she did not die as we\nmust, but that she was taken up into heaven, and that her body was not\nallowed to decay and return to dust, as ours will._Hombre!_ She is in\nheaven now, praying for us.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.What would become of us but for her?--for\nshe prays to God for us--she--!\"\"No, Rosendo, she does nothing of the kind.He could not be moved or influenced by the Virgin Mary or\nany one else.He is not angry with us--He\ncouldn't be, for He could not know anger.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.Did not Jesus say that God\nwas Love?Love does not afflict--Love does not need to be importuned\nor prayed to.We\nsuffer when we sin, because we'miss the mark.'<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the garden.But the punishment\nlasts only as long as the sin continues.And we suffer only until we\nknow that God is infinite good, and that there is no evil.That is the\ntruth, I feel sure, which Jesus came to teach, and which he said would\nmake us free.From the awful beliefs that use us, and\nto which we are now subject, until we learn the facts about God and\nHis creation.Don't you see that infinite good could never create\nevil, nor ever permit evil to be created, nor allow it to really\nexist?\"\"That we must wait to learn, Rosendo, little by little.You know, the\nSpanish proverb says, 'Step by step goes a great way.'But meantime,\nlet us go forward, clinging to this great truth: God is infinite\ngood--He is love--we are His dear children--and evil was _not_ made by\nHim, and does not have His sanction.And, being such, it can be overcome, as Jesus said\nit could.\"\"_Na_, Padre--\"\n\n\"Wait, Rosendo!\"\"Carmen is doing just what I\nam advising you to do--is she not?\"\"Padre, she knows God better than she knows me,\" the man whispered.\"It was you who first told her that God was everywhere, was it not?\"And the mind of the child, keenly sensitive and receptive to truth,\nhad eagerly grasped this dictum and made it the motif of her life.She\nknew nothing of Jesus, nothing of current theology.Divine Wisdom had\nused Rosendo, credulous and superstitious though he himself was, to\nguard this girl's mind against the entrance of errors which were\ntaught him as a child, and which in manhood held him shackled in\nchains which he might not break.\"Rosendo,\" Jose spoke low and reverently, \"I believe now that you and\nI have both been guided by that great mind which I am calling God.I\nbelieve we are being used for some beneficent purpose, and that it has\nto do with Carmen.That purpose will be unfolded to us as we bow to\nHis will.Every way closed against me, excepting the one that led to\nSimiti.And now there seems to be but one way open\nto you--to go back to Guamoco.And you go, forgetful of self, thinking\nonly that you serve her.Ah, friend, you are serving Him whom you\nreflect in love to His beautiful child.\"\"But, while we accept our tasks gratefully, I feel that we shall be\ntried--and we may not live to see the results of our labors.There are\ninfluences abroad which threaten danger to Carmen and to us.But we have given ourselves to her,

in the\ndoorway.\"Padre,\" he replied, \"I am an old man, and I have but few years left.But however many they be, they are hers.And had I a thousand, I would\ndrag them all through the fires of hell

verge burned\nsoftly with a ruddy glow.From the water's dimpling surface downy\nvapors rose languidly in delicate tints and drew slowly out in\nnebulous bands across the dawn sky.The smiling softness of the\nvelvety hills beckoned him, and the pungent odor of moist earth\ndilated his nostrils.He laughed aloud as the joyousness of youth\nsurged again through his veins.The village still slumbered, and no\none saw him as he smote his great chest and strode to the boat, where\nJuan had disposed his outfit and was waiting to pole him across.Only\nthe faithful Dona Maria had softly called a final \"_adioscito_\" to him\nwhen he left his house.A half hour later, when the dugout poked its\nblunt nose into the ooze of the opposite shore, he leaped out and\nhurriedly divested himself of his clothing.Then he lifted his chair\nwith its supplies to his shoulders, and Juan strapped it securely to\nhis back, drawing the heavy band tightly across his forehead.With a\nfarewell wave of his hand to the lad, the man turned and plunged into\nthe Guamoco trail, and was quickly lost in the dense thicket.Six days\nlater, if no accident befell, he would reach his destination, the\nsinging waters of the crystal Tigui.His heart leaped as he strode, though none knew better than he what\nhardships those six days held for him--days of plunging through\nfever-laden bogs; staggering in withering heat across open savannas;\nnow scaling the slippery <DW72>s of great mountains; now swimming the\nchill waters of rushing streams; making his bed where night overtook\nhim, among the softly pattering forest denizens and the swarming\ninsect life of the dripping woods.His black skin glistened with\nperspiration and the heavy dew wiped from the close-growing bush.With\none hand he leaned upon a young sapling cut for a staff.With the\nother he incessantly swung his _machete_ to clear the dim trail.His\neyes were held fixed to the ground, to escape tripping over low vines,\nand to avoid contact with crawling creatures of the jungle, whose\nsting, inflicted without provocation, might so easily prove fatal.His\nactive mind sported the while among the fresh thoughts stimulated by.his journey, though back of all, as through a veil, the vision of\nCarmen rose like the pillar of cloud which guided the wandering\nIsrael.Toil and danger fled its presence; and from it radiated a warm\nglow which suffused his soul with light.When Jose arose that morning he was still puzzling over the logical\nconclusions drawn from his premise of the evening before, and trying\nto reconcile them with common sense and prevalent belief.In a way, he\nseemed to be an explorer, carving a path to hidden wonders.Dona Maria\ngreeted him at the breakfast table with the simple announcement of\nRosendo's early departure.No sign of sorrow ruffled her quiet and\ndignified demeanor.Nor did Carmen, who bounded into his arms, fresh\nas a new-blown rose, manifest the slightest indication of anxiety\nregarding Rosendo's welfare.Jose might not divine the thoughts which\nthe woman's placid exterior concealed.But for the child, he well knew\nthat her problem had been met and solved, and that she had laid it\naside with a trust in immanent good which he did not believe all the\nworldly argument of pedant or philosopher could shake.cried Jose joyously, the meal finished.CHAPTER XX\n\nIN WHICH HARRY PASSES THROUGH HIS SEVEREST TRIAL, AND ACHIEVES HIS\nGREATEST TRIUMPH\n\n\nThree years may appear to be a great while to the little pilgrim\nthrough life's vicissitudes; but they soon pass away and are as \"a\ntale that is told.\"To note all the events of Harry's experience\nthrough this period would require another volume; therefore I can only\ntell the reader what he was, and what results he had achieved in that\ntime.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.It was filled with trials and temptations, not all of which were\novercome without care and privation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel took the football there.Often he failed, was often\ndisappointed, and often was pained to see how feebly the Spirit warred\nagainst the Flesh.He loved money, and avarice frequently prompted him to do those things\nwhich would have wrecked his bright hopes.That vision of the grandeur\nand influence of the rich man's position sometimes deluded him,\ncausing him to forget at times that the soul would live forever, while\nthe body and its treasures would perish in the grave.As he grew\nolder, he reasoned more; his principles became more firmly fixed; and\nthe object of existence assumed a more definite character.He was an\nattentive student, and every year not only made him wiser, but better.I do not mean to say that Harry was a remarkably good boy, that his\ncharacter was perfect, or anything of the kind.He meant well, and\ntried to do well, and he did not struggle in vain against the trials\nand temptations that beset him.I dare say those with whom he\nassociated did not consider him much better than themselves.It is\ntrue, he did not swear, did not frequent the haunts of vice and\ndissipation, did not spend his Sundays riding about the country; yet\nhe had his faults, and captious people did not fail to see them.He was still with Wake & Wade, though he was a salesman now, on a\nsalary of five dollars a week.Flint,\nthough Edward was no longer his room-mate.A year had been sufficient\nto disgust his \"fast\" companion with the homely fare and homely\nquarters of his father's house; and, as his salary was now eight\ndollars a week, he occupied a room in the attic of a first-class\nhotel.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the football there.Harry was sixteen years old, and he had three hundred dollars in the\nSavings Bank.He might have had more if he had not so carefully\nwatched and guarded against the sin of avarice.He gave some very\nhandsome sums to the various public charities, as well as expended\nthem in relieving distress wherever it presented itself.It is true,\nit was sometimes very hard work to give of his earnings to relieve the\npoor; and if he had acted in conformity with the nature he had\ninherited, he might never have known that it was \"more blessed to give\nthan to receive.\"As he grew older, and the worth of money was more\napparent, he was tempted to let the poor and the unfortunate take care\nof themselves; but the struggle of duty with parsimony rendered his\ngifts all the more worthy.Joe Flint had several times violated his solemn resolution to drink no\nmore ardent spirits; but Harry, who was his friend and confidant,\nencouraged him, when he failed, to try again; and it was now nearly a\nyear since he had been on a \"spree.\"Our hero occasionally heard from Rockville; and a few months before\nthe event we are about to narrate he had spent the pleasantest week of\nhis life with Julia Bryant, amid those scenes which were so full of\ninterest to both of them.As he walked through the woods where he had\nfirst met the \"little angel\"--she had now grown to be a tall girl--he\ncould not but recall the events of that meeting.It was there that he\nfirst began to live, in the true sense of the word.It was there that\nhe had been born into a new sphere of moral existence.Julia was still his friend, still his guiding star.Though the freedom\nof childish intimacy had been diminished, the same heart resided in\neach, and each felt the same interest in the other.The correspondence\nbetween them had been almost wholly suspended, perhaps by the\ninterference of the \"powers\" at Rockville, and perhaps by the growing\nsense of the \"fitness of things\" in the parties.But they occasionally\nmet, which amply compensated for the deprivations which propriety\ndemanded.But I must pass on to the closing event of my story--it was Harry's\nseverest trial, yet it resulted in his most signal triumph.He lived extravagantly, and\nhis increased salary was insufficient to meet his wants.When Harry\nsaw him drive a fast horse through the streets on Sundays, and heard\nhim say how often he went to the theatre, what balls and parties he\nattended--when he observed how elegantly he dressed, and that he wore\na gold chain, a costly breastpin and several rings--he did not wonder\nthat he was \"", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bedroom"}, {"input": "He lived like a prince, and it seemed as though\neight dollars a week would be but a drop in the bucket in meeting his\nexpenses.One day, in his extremity, he applied to Harry for the loan of five\ndollars.Our hero did not like to encourage his extravagance, but he\nwas good-natured, and could not well avoid doing the favor, especially\nas Edward wanted the money to pay his board.However, he made it the\noccasion for a friendly remonstrance, and gave the spendthrift youth\nsome excellent advice.Edward was vexed at the lecture; but, as he\nobtained the loan, he did not resent the kindly act.About a fortnight after, Edward paid him the money.It consisted of a\ntwo-dollar bill and six half dollars.Harry was about to make a\nfurther application of his views of duty to his friend's case, when\nEdward impatiently interrupted him, telling him that, as he had got\nhis money, he need not preach.This was just before Harry went home to\ndinner.Wake called him into the private office, and when\nthey had entered he closed and locked the door.Harry regarded this as\nrather a singular proceeding; but, possessing the entire confidence of\nhis employers, it gave him no uneasiness.Wake began, \"we have been losing money from the store for\nthe last year or more.I have missed small sums a great many times.\"exclaimed Harry, not knowing whether he was regarded as a\nconfidant or as the suspected person.\"To-day I gave a friend of mine several marked coins, with which he\npurchased some goods.\"Now, we have four salesmen besides yourself.\"I can form no idea, sir,\" returned Harry.\"Oh, well, I had no suspicion it was you,\" added Mr.\"I am going to try the same experiment again; and I want you to\nkeep your eyes on the money drawer all the rest of the afternoon.\"Wade took several silver coins from his pocket and scratched them\nin such a way that they could be readily identified, and then\ndismissed Harry, with the injunction to be very vigilant.When he came out of the office he perceived that Edward and Charles\nWallis were in close conversation.\"I say, Harry, what's in the wind?\"asked the former, as our hero\nreturned to his position behind the counter.Harry evaded answering the question, and the other two salesmen, who\nwere very intimate and whose tastes and amusements were very much\nalike, continued their conversation.They were evidently aware that\nsomething unusual had occurred, or was about to occur.Soon after, a person appeared at the counter and purchased a dozen\nspools of cotton, offering two half dollars in payment.Harry kept his\neye upon the money drawer, but nothing was discovered.From what he\nknew of Edward's mode of life, he was prepared to believe that he was\nthe guilty person.The experiment was tried for three days in succession before any\nresult was obtained.The coins were always found in the drawer; but on\nthe fourth day, when they were very busy, and there was a great deal\nof money in the drawer, Harry distinctly observed Edward, while making\nchange, take several coins from the till.The act appalled him; he\nforgot the customer to whose wants he was attending, and hastened to\ninform Mr.\"Only to the office,\" replied he; and his appearance and manner might\nhave attracted the attention of any skillful rogue.\"Come, Harry, don't leave your place,\" added Edward, playfully\ngrasping him by the collar, on his return.\"Don't stop to fool, Edward,\" answered Harry, as he shook him off and\ntook his place at the counter again.He was very absent-minded the rest of the forenoon, and his frame\nshook with agitation as he heard Mr.But he trembled still more when he was summoned also, for it was very\nunpleasant business.\"Of course, you will not object to letting me see the contents of\nyour pockets, Edward,\" said Mr.\"Certainly not, sir;\" and he turned every one of his pockets inside\nout.Not one of the decoy pieces was found upon him, or any other coins,\nfor that matter; he had no money.Wake was confused, for he fully\nexpected to convict the culprit on the spot.\"I suppose I am indebted to this young man for this,\" continued\nEdward, with a sneer.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the hallway.\"I'll bet five dollars he stole the money\nhimself, if any has been stolen.\"Search me, sir, by all means,\" added Harry; and he began to turn his\npockets out.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the apple there.From his vest pocket he took out a little parcel wrapped in a shop\nbill.I wasn't aware that there was any such thing in my\npocket.\"\"But you seem to know more about it than Edward,\" remarked Mr.The senior opened the wrapper, and to his surprise and sorrow found it\ncontained two of the marked coins.But he was not disposed hastily to\ncondemn Harry.He could not believe him capable of stealing; besides,\nthere was something in Edward's manner which seemed to indicate that\nour hero was the victim of a conspiracy.\"As he has been so very generous towards me, Mr.Wake,\" interposed\nEdward, \"I will suggest a means by which you may satisfy yourself.My\nmother keeps Harry's money for him, and perhaps, if you look it over,\nyou will find more marked pieces.\"Wake, I'm innocent,\" protested Harry, when he had in some measure\nrecovered from the first shock of the heavy blow.\"I don't believe you ever did, Harry.But can you explain how this\nmoney happened to be in your pocket?\"If you wish to look at my money, Mrs.\"Don't let him go with you, though,\" said Edward, maliciously.Flint, requesting her to exhibit the\nmoney, and Harry signed it.sneered Edward, when he had gone.\"So you have been\nwatching me, I thought as much.\"Wade told me to do,\" replied Harry, exceedingly\nmortified at the turn the investigation had taken.That is the way with you psalm-singers.Steal yourself, and\nlay it to me!\"\"I am sorry, Harry, to find that I have been mistaken in you.Is it\npossible that one who is outwardly so correct in his habits should be\na thief?But your career is finished,\" said he, very sternly, as he\nentered the office.\"Nothing strange to the rest of us,\" added Edward.\"I never knew one\nyet who pretended to be so pious that did not turn out a rascal.\"Wake, I am neither a thief nor a hypocrite,\" replied Harry, with\nspirit.\"I found four of the coins--four half dollars--which I marked first,\nat Mrs.Flint's,\" said the senior, severely.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the apple.Those half dollars were part of the money paid\nhim by Edward, and he so explained how they came in his possession.exclaimed Edward, with well-feigned surprise.\"I\nnever borrowed a cent of him in my life; and, of course, never paid\nhim a cent.\"Harry looked at Edward, amazed at the coolness with which he uttered\nthe monstrous lie.He questioned him in regard to the transaction, but\nthe young reprobate reiterated his declaration with so much force and\nart that Mr.Our hero, conscious of his innocence, however strong appearances were\nagainst him, behaved with considerable spirit, which so irritated Mr.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the apple there.Wake that he sent for a constable, and Harry soon found himself in\nLeverett Street Jail.Strange as it may seem to my young friends, he\nwas not very miserable there.He was innocent, and he depended upon\nthat special Providence which had before befriended him to extricate\nhim from the difficulty.It is true, he wondered what Julia would say\nwhen she heard of his misfortune.She would weep and grieve; and he\nwas sad when he thought of her.But she would be the more rejoiced\nwhen she learned that he was innocent.The triumph would be in\nproportion to the trial.On the following day he was brought up for examination.As his name\nwas called, the propriety of the court was suddenly disturbed by an\nexclamation of surprise from an elderly man, with sun-browned face and\nmonstrous whiskers.almost shouted the elderly man, regardless of the dignity\nof the court.An officer was on the point of turning him out; but his earnest manner\nsaved him.Wake, he questioned him in\nregard to the youthful prisoner.muttered the elderly man, in the\nmost intense excitement.Harry had a friend who had not been idle,\nas the sequel will show.Wake first testified to the facts we have already related, and the\nlawyer, whom Harry's friends had provided, questioned him in regard to\nthe prisoner's character and antecedents.He was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Harry's\ncounsel, in which he repeatedly denied that he had ever borrowed or\npaid any money to the accused.While the events preceding Harry's\narrest were transpiring, he had been absent from the city, but had\nreturned early in the afternoon.He disagreed with his partner in\nrelation to our hero's guilt, and immediately set himself to work to\nunmask the conspiracy, for such he was persuaded it was.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel dropped the apple.He testified that, a short time before, Edward had requested him to\npay him his salary two days before it was due, assigning as a reason\nthe fact that he owed Harry five dollars, which he wished to pay.He\nproduced two of the marked half dollars, which he had received from\nEdward's landlady.Of course, Edward was utterly confounded; and, to add to his\nconfusion, he was immediately called to the stand again.This time his\ncoolness was gone; he crossed himself a dozen times, and finally\nacknowledged, under the pressure of the skillful lawyer's close\nquestioning, that Harry was innocent.He had paid him the money found\nin Mrs.Flint's possession, and had slipped the coins wrapped in the\nshop bills into his pocket when he took him by the collar on his\nreturn from the office.He had known for some time that the partners were on the watch for the\nthief.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.He had heard them talking about the matter; but he supposed he\nhad managed the case so well as to exonerate himself and implicate\nHarry, whom he hated for being a good boy.His heart swelled with gratitude for the kindly\ninterposition of Providence.The trial was past--the triumph had come.Wade, and other friends, congratulated him on the happy\ntermination of the affair; and while they were so engaged the elderly\nman elbowed his way through the crowd to the place where Harry stood.\"Young man, what is your father's name?\"he asked, in tones tremulous\nwith emotion.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the apple there.\"You had a father--what was his name?\"<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the office.\"Franklin West; a carpenter by trade.He went from Redfield to\nValparaiso when I was very young, and we never heard anything from\nhim.\"exclaimed the stranger, grasping our hero by the hand, while\nthe tears rolled down his brown visage.Harry did not know what to make of this announcement.\"Is it possible that you are my father?\"\"I am, Harry; but I was sure you were dead.I got a letter, informing\nme that your mother and the baby had gone; and about a year after I\nmet a man from Rockville who told me that you had died also.\"They continued the conversation as they walked from the court room to\nthe store.There was a long story for each to tell.West confessed\nthat, for two years after his arrival at Valparaiso, he had\naccomplished very little.He drank hard, and brought on a fever, which\nhad nearly carried him off.But that fever was a blessing in disguise;\nand since his recovery he had been entirely temperate.He had nothing\nto send to his family, and shame prevented him from even writing to\nhis wife.He received the letter which conveyed the intelligence of\nthe death of his wife and child, and soon after learned that his\nremaining little one was also gone.Carpenters were then in great demand in Valparaiso.He was soon in a\ncondition to take contracts, and fortune smiled upon him.He had\nrendered himself independent, and had now returned to spend his\nremaining days in his native land.He had been in Boston a week, and\nhappened to stray into the Police Court, where he had found the son\nwho, he supposed, had long ago been laid in the grave.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bathroom.Edward Flint finished his career of \"fashionable dissipation\" by being\nsentenced to the house of correction.Just before he was sent over, he\nconfessed to Mr.Wade that it was he who had stolen Harry's money,\nthree years before.The next day Harry obtained leave of absence, for the purpose of\naccompanying his father on a visit to Redfield.<|begin_of_text|>John took the milk there.He was in exuberant\nspirits.It seemed as though his cup of joy was full.He could hardly\nrealize that he had a father--a kind, affectionate father--who shared\nthe joy of his heart.They went to Redfield; but I cannot stop to tell my readers how\nastonished Squire Walker, and Mr.Nason, and the paupers were, to see\nthe spruce young clerk come to his early home, attended by his\nfather--a rich father, too.We can follow our hero no farther through the highways and byways of\nhis life-pilgrimage.We have seen him struggle like a hero through\ntrial and temptation, and come off conqueror in the end.He has found\na rich father, who crowns his lot with plenty; but his true wealth is\nin those good principles which the trials, no less than the triumphs,\nof his career have planted in his soul.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.CHAPTER XXI\n\nIN WHICH HARRY IS VERY PLEASANTLY SITUATED, AND THE STORY COMES TO AN\nEND\n\n\nPerhaps my young readers will desire to know something of Harry's\nsubsequent life; and we will \"drop in\" upon him at his pleasant\nresidence in Rockville, without the formality of an introduction.The\nyears have elapsed since we parted with him, after his triumphant\ndischarge from arrest.His father did not live long after his return\nto his native land, and when he was twenty-one, Harry came into\npossession of a handsome fortune.But even wealth could not tempt him\nto choose a life of idleness; and he went into partnership with Mr.Wade, the senior retiring at the same time.The firm of Wade and West\nis quite as respectable as any in the city.Harry is not a slave to business; and he spends a portion of his time\nat his beautiful place in Rockville; for the cars pass through the\nvillage, which is only a ride of an hour and a half from the city.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the office.West's house is situated on a gentle eminence not far distant from\nthe turnpike road.It is built upon the very spot where the cabin of\nthe charcoal burners stood, in which Harry, the fugitive, passed two\nnights.The aspect of the place is entirely changed, though the very\nrock upon which our hero ate the sumptuous repast the little angel\nbrought him may be seen in the centre of the beautiful garden, by the\nside of the house.West often seats himself there to think of the\nevents of the past, and to treasure up the pleasant memories connected\nwith the vicinity.The house is elegant and spacious, though there is nothing gaudy or\ngay about it.It is plainly furnished, though the\narticles are rich and tasteful.Who is that\nbeautiful lady sitting at the piano-forte?<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bathroom.Do you not recognize her,\ngentle reader?West, and an old\nacquaintance.She is no longer the little angel, though I cannot tell\nher height or her weight; but her husband thinks she is just as much\nof an angel now as when she fed him on doughnuts upon the flat rock in\nthe garden.He is a fine-looking man, rather tall; and\nthough he does not wear a mustache, I have no doubt Mrs.West thinks\nhe is handsome--which is all very well, provided he does not think so\nhimself.\"This is a capital day, Julia; suppose we ride over to Redfield, and\nsee friend Nason,\" said Mr.The horse is ordered; and as they ride along, the gentleman amuses his\nwife with the oft-repeated story of his flight from Jacob Wire's.\"That is the very one<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.", "question": "Where is the milk?

Y.Papineau undoubtedly did much to hasten the day of responsible\ngovernment in Canada; {42} but in this process he was in reality an\nunwitting agent.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel put down the milk.The Ninety-Two Resolutions secured a majority of fifty-six to\ntwenty-four.But in the minority voted John Neilson, Augustin\nCuvillier, F. A. Quesnel, and Andrew Stuart, who now definitely broke\naway from Papineau's party.There are signs, too, that the\nconsiderable number of Catholic clergy who had openly supported\nPapineau now began to withdraw from the camp of a leader advocating\nsuch republican and revolutionary ideas.There is ground also for\nbelieving that not a little unrest disturbed those who voted with\nPapineau in 1834.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bathroom.In the next year Elzear Bedard, who had moved the\nNinety-Two Resolutions, broke with Papineau.Another seceder was\nEtienne Parent, the editor of the revived _Canadien_, and one of the\ngreat figures in French-Canadian literature.Both Bedard and Parent\nwere citizens of Quebec, and they carried with them the great body of\npublic opinion in the provincial capital.It will be observed later\nthat during the disturbances of 1837 Quebec remained quiet.None of the seceders abandoned the demand for the redress of\ngrievances.They merely {43} refused to follow Papineau in his extreme\ncourse.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the milk there.For this they were assailed with some of the rhetoric which\nhad hitherto been reserved for the 'Bureaucrats.'To them was applied\nthe opprobrious epithet of _Chouayens_[1]--a name which had been used\nby Etienne Parent himself in 1828 to describe those French Canadians\nwho took sides with the government party.[1] The name _Chouayen_ or _Chouaguen_ appears to have been first used\nas a term of reproach at the siege of Oswego in 1756.It is said that\nafter the fall of the forts there to Montcalm's armies a number of\nCanadian soldiers arrived too late to take part in the fighting.By\nthe soldiers who had borne the brunt of the battle the late-comers were\ndubbed _Chouaguens_, this being the way the rank and file of the French\nsoldiers pronounced the Indian name of Oswego.Thus the term came to\nmean one who refuses to follow, or who lets others do the fighting and\nkeeps out of it himself.Perhaps the nearest English, or rather\nAmerican, equivalent is the name Mugwump.{44}\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE ROYAL COMMISSION\n\nA general election followed soon after the passing of the Ninety-Two\nResolutions and revealed the strength of Papineau's position in the\ncountry.All those members of the _Patriote_ party who had opposed the\nResolutions--Neilson, Cuvillier, Quesnel, Stuart, and two or three\nothers--suffered defeat at the polls.The first division-list in the\nnew Assembly showed seventy members voting for Papineau as speaker, and\nonly six voting against him.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the garden.The Resolutions were forwarded to Westminster, both through the\nAssembly's agent in London and through Lord Aylmer, who received the\naddress embodying the Resolutions, despite the fact that they demanded\nhis own impeachment.The British House of Commons appointed a special\ncommittee to inquire into the grievances of which the Resolutions\ncomplained; but there followed {45} no immediate action by the\ngovernment.The years 1834 and 1835 saw much disturbance in British\npolitics: there were no less than four successive ministers at the\nColonial Office.It was natural that there should be some delay in\ndealing with the troubles of Lower Canada.In the spring of 1835,\nhowever, the government made up its mind about the course to pursue.It decided to send to Canada a royal commission for the purpose of\ninvestigating, and if possible settling, the questions in dispute.It\nwas thought advisable to combine in one person the office of chief\nroyal commissioner and that of governor of Canada.To clear the way\nfor this arrangement Lord Aylmer was recalled.But he was expressly\nrelieved from all censure: it was merely recognized by the authorities\nthat his unfortunate relations with the Assembly made it unlikely that\nhe would be able to offer any assistance in a solution of the problem.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the milk.The unenviable position of governor and chief royal commissioner was\noffered in turn to several English statesmen and declined by all of\nthem.It was eventually accepted by Lord Gosford, an Irish peer\nwithout experience in public life.With him were associated as\ncommissioners Sir Charles Grey, afterwards {46} governor of Jamaica,\nand Sir George Gipps, afterwards governor of New South Wales.These\ntwo men were evidently intended to offset each other: Grey was commonly\nrated as a Tory, while Gipps was a Liberal.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bedroom.Lord Gosford's appointment\ncaused much surprise.He was a stranger in politics and in civil\ngovernment.There is no doubt that his appointment was a last\nresource.But his Irish geniality and his facility in being all things\nto all men were no small recommendations for a governor who was to\nattempt to set things right in Canada.The policy of Lord Glenelg, the colonial secretary during Gosford's\nperiod of office, was to do everything in his power to conciliate the\nCanadian _Patriotes_, short of making any real constitutional\nconcessions.By means of a conciliatory attitude he hoped to induce\nthem to abate some of their demands.There is, indeed, evidence that\nhe was personally willing to go further: he seems to have proposed to\nWilliam IV that the French Canadians should be granted, as they\ndesired, an elective Legislative Council; but the staunch old Tory king\nwould not hear of the change.'The king objects on principle,' the\nministers were told, 'and upon what he {47} considers sound\nconstitutional principle, to the adoption of the elective principle in\nthe constitution of the legislative councils in the colonies.'In 1836\nthe king had not yet become a negligible factor in determining the\npolicy of the government; and the idea was dropped.Lord Gosford arrived in Canada at the end of the summer of 1835 to find\nhimself confronted with a discouraging state of affairs.A short\nsession of the Assembly in the earlier part of the year had been marked\nby unprecedented violence.Papineau had attacked Lord Aylmer in\nlanguage breathing passion; and had caused Lord Aylmer's reply to the\naddress of the Assembly containing the Ninety-Two Resolutions to be\nexpunged from the journals of the House as 'an insult cast at the whole\nnation.'Papineau had professed himself hopeless of any amendment of\ngrievances by Great Britain.'When Reform ministries, who called\nthemselves our friends,' he said, 'have been deaf to our complaints,\ncan we hope that a Tory ministry, the enemy of Reform, will give us a\nbetter hearing?We have nothing to expect from the Tories unless we\ncan inspire them with fear or worry them by ceaseless importunity.'It\n{48} should be observed, however, that in 1835 Papineau explicitly\ndisclaimed any intention of stirring up civil war.When Gugy, one of\nthe English members of the Assembly,[1] accused him of such an\nintention, Papineau replied:\n\n\nMr Gugy has talked to us again about an outbreak and civil war--a\nridiculous bugbear which is regularly revived every time the House\nprotests against these abuses, as it was under Craig, under Dalhousie,\nand still more persistently under the present governor.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the kitchen.Doubtless the\nhonourable gentleman, having studied military tactics as a lieutenant\nin the militia--I do not say as a major, for he has been a major only\nfor the purposes of the parade-ground and the ball-room--is quite\ncompetent to judge of the results of a civil war and of the forces of\nthe country, but he need not fancy that he can frighten us by hinting\nto us that he will fight in the ranks of the enemy.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the garden.All his threats\nare futile, and his fears but the creatures of imagination.Papineau did not yet contemplate an appeal {49} to arms; and of course\nhe could not foresee that only two years later Conrad Gugy would be one\nof the first to enter the village of St Eustache after the defeat of\nthe _Patriote_ forces.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the football there.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.In spite of the inflamed state of public feeling, Lord Gosford tried to\nput into effect his policy of conciliation.He sought to win the\nconfidence of the French Canadians by presiding at their\nentertainments, by attending the distribution of prizes at their\nseminaries, and by giving balls on their feast days.He entertained\nlavishly, and his manners toward his guests were decidedly convivial.'_Mil", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>garden"}, {"input": "'Pardonnez,' replied Gosford; '_c'est le\nvin_.'Even Papineau was induced to accept the governor's hospitality,\nthough there were not wanting those who warned Gosford that Papineau\nwas irreconcilable.'By a wrong-headed and melancholy alchemy,' wrote\nan English officer in Quebec to Gosford, 'he will transmute every\npublic concession into a demand for more, in a ratio equal to its\nextent; and his disordered moral palate, beneath the blandest smile and\nthe {50} softest language, will turn your Burgundy into vinegar.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bedroom.The speech with which Lord Gosford opened the session of the\nlegislature in the autumn of 1835 was in line with the rest of his\npolicy.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the hallway.<|begin_of_text|>Mary grabbed the football there.He announced his determination to effect the redress of every\ngrievance.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bedroom.In some cases the action of the executive government would\nbe sufficient to supply the remedy.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the milk there.In others the assistance of the\nlegislature would be necessary.A third class of cases would call for\nthe sanction of the British parliament.He promised that no\ndiscrimination against French Canadians should be made in appointments\nto office.He expressed the opinion that executive councillors should\nnot sit in the legislature.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.He announced that the French would be\nguaranteed the use of their native tongue.He made an earnest plea for\nthe settlement of the financial difficulty, and offered some\nconcessions.The legislature should be given control of the hereditary\nrevenues of the Crown, if provision were made for the support of the\nexecutive and the judiciary.Finally, he made a plea for the\nreconciliation of the French and English races in the country, whom he\ndescribed as 'the offspring of the two foremost nations {51} of\nmankind.'Not even the most extreme of the _Patriotes_ could fail to\nsee that Lord Gosford was holding out to them an olive branch.Great dissatisfaction, of course, arose among the English in the colony\nat Lord Gosford's policy.'Constitutional associations,' which had\nbeen formed in Quebec and Montreal for the defence of the constitution\nand the rights and privileges of the English-speaking inhabitants of\nCanada, expressed gloomy forebodings as to the probable result of the\npolicy.The British in Montreal organized among themselves a volunteer\nrifle corps, eight hundred strong, 'to protect their persons and\nproperty, and to assist in maintaining the rights and principles\ngranted them by the constitution'; and there was much indignation when\nthe rifle corps was forced to disband by order of the governor, who\ndeclared that the constitution was in no danger, and that, even if it\nwere, the government would be competent to deal with the situation.Nor did Gosford find it plain sailing with all the French Canadians.Papineau's followers in the House took up at first a distinctly\nindependent attitude.Gosford was informed {52} that the appointment\nof the royal commission was an insult to the Assembly; it threw doubt\non the assertions which Papineau and his followers had made in\npetitions and resolutions.If the report of the commissioners turned\nout to be in accord with the views of the House, well and good; but if\nnot, that would not influence the attitude of the House.In spite, however, of the uneasiness of the English official element,\nand the obduracy of the extreme _Patriotes_, it is barely possible that\nGosford, with his _bonhomie_ and his Burgundy, might have effected a\nmodus vivendi, had there not occurred, about six months after Gosford's\narrival in Canada, one of those unfortunate and unforeseen events which\nupset the best-laid schemes of mice and men.<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the football.This was the indiscreet\naction of Sir Francis Bond Head, the newly appointed\nlieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, in communicating to the\nlegislature of Upper Canada the _ipsissima verba_ of his instructions\nfrom the Colonial Office.It was immediately seen that a discrepancy\nexisted between the tenor of Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions and\nthe tenor of Lord Gosford's speech at the opening of the legislature of\nLower Canada in 1835.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the football there.{53} Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions showed\nbeyond peradventure that the British government did not contemplate any\nreal constitutional changes in the Canadas; above all, it did not\npropose to yield to the demand for an elective Legislative Council.This fact was called to the attention of Papineau and his friends by\nMarshall Spring Bidwell, the speaker of the Assembly of Upper Canada;\nand immediately the fat was in the fire.Papineau was confirmed in his\nbelief that justice could not be hoped for; those who had been won over\nby Gosford's blandishments experienced a revulsion of feeling; and\nGosford saw the fruit of his efforts vanishing into thin air.<|begin_of_text|>John got the milk there.Lord Gosford had asked the\nAssembly to vote a permanent civil list, in view of the fact that the\ngovernment offered to hand over to the control of the legislature the\ncasual and territorial revenues of the Crown.But the publication of\nSir Francis Bond Head's instructions effectually destroyed any hope of\nthis compromise being accepted.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the bathroom.In the session of the House which was\nheld in the early part of 1836, Papineau and his friends not only\nrefused to vote a permanent civil {54} list; they declined to grant\nmore than six months' supply in any case; and with this they made the\nthreat that if the demands of the _Patriotes_ were not met at the end\nof the six months, no more supplies would be voted.This action was\ndeemed so unsatisfactory that the Legislative Council threw out the\nbill of supply.The result was widespread distress among the public\nofficials of the colony.This was the fourth year in which no\nprovision had been made for the upkeep of government.In 1833 the bill\nof supply had been so cumbered with conditions that it had been\nrejected by the Legislative Council.In 1834, owing to disputes\nbetween the Executive and the Assembly, the legislature had separated\nwithout a vote on the estimates.In 1835 the Assembly had declined to\nmake any vote of supply.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.In earlier years the Executive had been able,\nowing to its control of certain royal and imperial revenues, to carry\non the government after a fashion under such circumstances; but since\nit had transferred a large part of these revenues to the control of the\nlegislature, it was no longer able to meet the situation.Papineau and\nhis friends doubtless recognized that they now had the 'Bureaucrats' at\ntheir mercy; and {55} they seem to have made up their minds to achieve\nthe full measure of their demands, or make government impossible by\nwithholding the supplies, no matter what suffering this course might\ninflict on the families of the public servants.In the autumn of 1836 the royal commissioners brought their labours to\na close.Lord Gosford, it is true, remained in the colony as governor\nuntil the beginning of 1838, and Sir George Gipps remained until the\nbeginning of 1837, but Sir Charles Grey left for England in November\n1836 with the last of the commissioners' reports.These reports, which\nwere six in number, exercised little direct influence upon the course\nof events in Canada.The commissioners pronounced against the\nintroduction of responsible government, in the modern sense of the\nterm, on the ground that it would be incompatible with the status of a\ncolony.They advised against the project of an elective Legislative\nCouncil.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the hallway.In the event of a crisis arising, they submitted the question\nwhether the total suspension of the constitution would not be less\nobjectionable than any partial interference with the particular\nclauses.It is evident from the reports that the commissioners had\n{56} bravely survived their earlier view that the discontented\nCanadians might be won over by unctuous blandishments alone.They\ncould not avoid the conclusion that this policy had failed.[1] He was really of Swiss extraction.{57}\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE RUSSELL RESOLUTIONS\n\nWhen the legislature of Lower Canada met in the autumn of 1836, Lord\nGosford earnestly called its attention to the estimates of the current\nyear and the accounts showing the arrears unpaid.Six months, however,\nhad passed by, and there was no sign of the redress of grievances.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the bedroom.The\nroyal commission, indeed, had not completed its investigations.The\nAssembly, therefore, refused once more to vote the necessary supplies.'In reference to the demand for a supply,' they told the governor,\n'relying on the salutary maxim, that the correction of abuses and the\nredress of grievances ought to precede the grant thereof, we have been\nof opinion that there is nothing to authorize us to alter our\nresolution of the last session.'This answer marked the final and indubitable breakdown of the policy of\nconciliation without concession.This was recognized by {58} Gosford,\nwho soon afterwards wrote home asking to be allowed to resign, and\nrecommending the appointment of a governor whose hands were 'not\npledged as mine are to a mild and conciliatory line of policy.'<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.Two alternatives were now open to the British ministers--either to make\na complete capitulation to the demands of the _Patriotes_, or to deal\nwith the situation in a high-handed way.They chose the latter course,\nthough with some hesitation and perhaps with regret.On March 6, 1837,\nLord John Russell, chancellor of the Exchequer in the Melbourne\nadministration and one of the most liberal-minded statesmen in England,\nintroduced into the House of Commons ten resolutions dealing with the\naffairs of Canada.These resolutions recited that since 1832 no\nprovision had been made by the Assembly of Lower Canada for defraying\nthe charges for the administration of justice or for the support of the\ncivil government; that the attention of the Assembly had been called to\nthe arrears due; and that the Assembly had declined to vote a supply\nuntil its demands for radical political changes were satisfied.The\nresolutions declared that though both the bodies in question might be\nimproved in respect of their composition, it {59} was inadvisable to\ngrant the demand to make the Legislative Council elective, or to\nsubject the Executive Council to the responsibility demanded by the\nHouse of Assembly.In regard to the financial question, the\nresolutions repeated the offer made by Lord Aylmer and Lord\nGosford--namely, to hand over to the Assembly the control of the\nhereditary, territorial, and casual revenues of the Crown, on condition\nthat the Assembly would grant a permanent civil list.<|begin_of_text|>John travelled to the hallway.But the main\nfeature of the resolutions was the clause empowering the governor to\npay out of the public revenues, without authorization of the Assembly,\nthe moneys necessary for defraying the cost of government in the\nprovince up to April 10, 1837.This, though not exactly a suspension\nof the constitution of Lower Canada and a measure quite legally within\nthe competency of the House of Commons, was a flat negative to the\nclaim of the Lower-Canadian Assembly to control over the executive\ngovernment, through the power of the purse or otherwise.A long and important debate in Parliament followed on these\nresolutions.Some of the chief political leaders of the day took part\nin the discussion.Daniel O'Connell, the great {60} tribune of the\nIrish people, took up the cudgels for the French Canadians.Doubtless\nit seemed to him that the French Canadians, like the Irish, were\nvictims of Anglo-Saxon tyranny and bigotry.Sir George Grey, the\ncolleague of Gosford, Lord Stanley, a former colonial secretary, and\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, then a vigorous young Tory, spoke in support\nof the resolutions.The chief opposition came from the Radical wing of\nthe Whig party, headed by Hume and Roebuck; but these members were\ncomparatively few in number, and the resolutions were passed by\noverwhelming majorities.From a print in the Chateau de Ramezay.]As soon as the passage of the resolutions became known in Canada,\nPapineau and his friends began to set the heather on fire.On May 7,\n1837, the _Patriotes_ held a huge open-air meeting at St Ours, eleven\nmiles above Sorel on the river Richelieu.The chief organizer of the\nmeeting was Dr Wolfred Nelson, a member of the Assembly living in the\nneighbouring village of St Denis, who was destined to be one of the\nleaders of the revolt at the end of the year.Papineau himself was\npresent at the meeting and he spoke in his usual violent strain.He\nsubmitted a resolution declaring that 'we cannot but {61} consider a\ngovernment which has recourse to injustice, to force, and to a\nviolation of the social contract, anything else than an oppressive\ngovernment, a government by force, for which the measure of our\nsubmission should henceforth be simply the measure of our numerical\nstrength, in combination with the sympathy we may find elsewhere.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the office.At\nSt Laurent a week later he used language no less dangerous.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the football.'The\nRussell resolutions,' he cried, 'are a foul stain; the people should\nnot, and will not, submit to them; the people must transmit their just\nrights to their posterity, even though it cost them their property and\ntheir lives to do so.'All over the\nprovince the _Patriotes_ met together to protest against what they\ncalled 'coercion.'As a rule the meetings were held in the country\nparishes after church on Sunday, when the habitants were gathered\ntogether.Most inflammatory language was used, and flags and placards\nwere displayed bearing such devices as '_Papineau et le systeme\nelectif_,' '_Papineau et l'independence_,' and '_A bas le despotisme_.'Alarmed by such language, Lord Gosford issued on June 15 a proclamation\ncalling on all loyal {62} subjects to discountenance writings of a\nseditious tendency, and to avoid meetings of a turbulent or political\ncharacter.But the proclamation produced no abatement in the\nagitation; it merely offered one more subject for denunciation.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the hallway.During this period Papineau and his friends continually drew their\ninspiration from the procedure of the Whigs in the American colonies\nbefore 1776.The resolutions of the _Patriotes_ recalled the language\nof the Declaration of Independence.One of the first measures of the\nAmericans had been to boycott English goods; one of the first measures\nof the _Patriotes_ was a resolution passed at St Ours binding them to\nforswear the use of imported English goods and to use only the products\nof Canadian industry.At the short and abortive session of the\nlegislature which took place at the end of the summer of 1837, nearly\nall the members of the Assembly appeared in clothes made of Canadian\nfrieze.The shifts of some of the members to avoid wearing English\nimported articles were rather amusing.'Mr Rodier's dress,' said the\nQuebec _Mercury_, 'excited the greatest attention, being unique with\nthe exception of a pair of Berlin gloves, viz.: frock coat of {63}\ngranite colored _etoffe du pays_; inexpressibles and vest of the same\nmaterial, striped blue and white; straw hat, and beef shoes, with a\npair of home-made socks, completed the _outre_ attire.Mr Rodier, it\nwas remarked, had no shirt on, having doubtless been unable to smuggle\nor manufacture one.'But Louis LaFontaine and 'Beau' Viger limited\ntheir patriotism, it appears, to the wearing of Canadian-made\nwaistcoats.The imitation of the American revolutionists did not end\nhere.If the New England colonies had their 'Sons of Liberty,' Lower\nCanada had its '_Fils de la Liberte_'--an association formed in\nMontreal in the autumn of 1837.And the Lower Canada Patriotes\noutstripped the New England patriots in the republican character of\ntheir utterances.'Our only hope,' announced _La Minerve_, 'is to\nelect our governor ourselves, or, in other words, to cease to belong to\nthe British Empire.'<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the milk.A manifesto of some of the younger spirits of the\n_Patriote_ party, issued on October", "question": "Where is the milk?

and an attempt was made to form a\nloyalist rifle corps in Montreal.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the bedroom.The attempt failed owing to the\nopposition of the governor, who was afraid that such a step would\nmerely aggravate the situation.Not even Gosford, however, was blind\nto the seriousness of the situation.He wrote to the colonial\nsecretary on September 2, 1837, that all hope of conciliation had\npassed.Papineau's aims were now the separation of Canada from England\nand the establishment of a republican form of government.'I am\ndisposed to think,' he concluded, 'that you may be under the necessity\nof suspending the constitution.'It was at this time that the Church first threw its weight openly\nagainst the revolutionary movement.The British government had\naccorded to Catholics in Canada a measure of liberty at once just and\ngenerous; and the bishops and clergy were not slow to see that under a\nrepublican form of government, {65} whether as a state in the American\nUnion or as an independent _nation canadienne_, they might be much\nworse off, and would not be any better off, than under the dominion of\nGreat Britain.In the summer of 1837 Mgr Lartigue, the bishop of\nMontreal, addressed a communication to the clergy of his diocese asking\nthem to keep the people within the path of duty.In October he\nfollowed this up by a Pastoral Letter, to be read in all the churches,\nwarning the people against the sin of rebellion.He held over those\nwho contemplated rebellion the penalties of the Church: 'The present\nquestion amounts to nothing less than this--whether you will choose to\nmaintain, or whether you will choose to abandon, the laws of your\nreligion.'The ecclesiastical authorities were roused to action by a great meeting\nheld on October 23, at St Charles on the Richelieu, the largest and\nmost imposing of all the meetings thus far.<|begin_of_text|>John left the milk.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.Five or six thousand\npeople attended it, representing all the counties about the Richelieu.Dr Wolfred Nelson was in the\nchair, but Papineau was the central figure.A company of armed men,\nheaded by two militia officers who had been dismissed for disloyalty,\nand {66} drawn up as a guard, saluted every resolution of the meeting\nwith a volley.A wooden pillar, with a cap of liberty on top, was\nerected, and dedicated to Papineau.At the end of the proceedings\nPapineau was led up to the column to receive an address.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the bedroom.After this\nall present marched past singing popular airs; and each man placed his\nhand on the column, swearing to be faithful to the cause of his\ncountry, and to conquer or die for her.All this, of course, was\ncomparatively innocent.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went to the bathroom.The resolutions, too, were not more violent\nthan many others which had been passed elsewhere.Nor did Papineau use\nlanguage more extreme than usual.Many of the _Patriotes_, indeed,\nconsidered his speech too moderate.He deprecated any recourse to arms\nand advised his hearers merely to boycott English goods, in order to\nbring the government to righteousness.But some of his lieutenants\nused language which seemed dangerous.Roused by the eloquence of their\nleader, they went further than he would venture, and advocated an\nappeal to the arbitrament of war.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.'The time has come,' cried Wolfred\nNelson, 'to melt our spoons into bullets.'The exact attitude of Papineau during {67} these months of agitation is\ndifficult to determine.He does not seem to have been quite clear as\nto what course he should pursue.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the office.He had completely lost faith in\nBritish justice.He earnestly desired the emancipation of Canada from\nBritish rule and the establishment of a republican system of\ngovernment.But he could not make up his mind to commit himself to\narmed rebellion.'I must say, however,' he had announced at St\nLaurent, 'and it is neither fear nor scruple that makes me do so, that\nthe day has not yet come for us to respond to that appeal.'The same\nattitude is apparent, in spite of the haughty and defiant language, in\nthe letter which he addressed to the governor's secretary in answer to\nan inquiry as to what he had said at St Laurent:\n\n\nSIR,--The pretension of the governor to interrogate me respecting my\nconduct at St Laurent on the 15th of May last is an impertinence which\nI repel with contempt and silence.I, however, take the pen merely to tell the governor that it is false\nthat any of the resolutions adopted at the meeting of the county of\nMontreal, held at St Laurent {68} on the 15th May last, recommend a\nviolation of the laws, as in his ignorance he may believe, or as he at\nleast asserts.--Your obedient servant,\n\nL. J. PAPINEAU.<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the milk there.At St Charles Papineau was even more precise in repudiating revolution;\nand there is no evidence that, when rebellion was decided upon,\nPapineau played any important part in laying the plans.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.In later years\nhe was always emphatic in denying that the rebellion of 1837 had been\nprimarily his handiwork.'I was,' he said in 1847, 'neither more nor\nless guilty, nor more nor less deserving, than a great number of my\ncolleagues.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary went back to the bathroom.The truth seems to be that Papineau always balked a\nlittle at the idea of armed rebellion, and that he was carried off his\nfeet at the end of 1837 by his younger associates, whose enthusiasm he\nhimself had inspired.He had raised the wind, but he could not ride\nthe whirlwind.[Illustration: South-Western Lower Canada, 1837.]{69}\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE DOGS OF WAR\n\nAs the autumn of 1837 wore on, the situation in Lower Canada began to\nassume an aspect more and more threatening.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the office.In spite of a proclamation\nfrom the governor forbidding such meetings, the _Patriotes_ continued\nto gather for military drill and musketry exercises.Armed bands went\nabout the countryside, in many places intimidating the loyalists and\nforcing loyal magistrates and militia officers to send in their\nresignations to the governor.As early as July some of the Scottish\nsettlers at Cote St Joseph, near St Eustache, had fled from their\nhomes, leaving their property to its fate.Several houses at Cote St\nMary had been fired upon or broken into.A letter of Sir John\nColborne, the commander of the forces in British North America, written\non October 6, shows what the state of affairs was at that time:\n\n\nIn my correspondence with Col.Eden I have had occasion to refer to the\nfacts {70} and reports that establish the decided character which the\nagitators have lately assumed.The people have elected the dismissed\nofficers of the militia to command them.At St Ours a pole has been\nerected in favour of a dismissed captain with this inscription on it,\n'Elu par le peuple.'<|begin_of_text|>Mary put down the milk.At St Hyacinthe the tri-coloured flag was\ndisplayed for several days.Two families have quitted the town in\nconsequence of the annoyance they received from the patriots.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel moved to the bathroom.Wolfred\nNelson warned the patriots at a public meeting to be ready to arm.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.The\ntri-coloured flag is to be seen at two taverns between St Denis and St\nCharles.Many of the tavern-keepers have discontinued their signs and\nsubstituted for them an eagle.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.The bank notes or promissory notes\nissued at Yamaska have also the same emblem marked on them.Mr\nPapineau was escorted from Yamaska to St Denis by a numerous retinue,\nand it is said that 200 or 300 carriages accompanied him on his route.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.He has attended five public meetings lately; and at one of them La\nValtrie, a priest, was insulted in his presence.The occurrence at St\nDenis was certainly {71} a political affair, a family at St Antoine\nopposed to the proceedings of W. Nelson, having been annoyed by the\nsame mob that destroyed the house of Madame St Jacques a few hours\nbefore the shot was fired from her window.Special animosity was shown toward the Chouayens, those French\nCanadians who had refused to follow Papineau's lead.P. D. Debartzch,\na legislative councillor and a former supporter of Papineau, who had\nwithdrawn his support after the passing of the Ninety-Two Resolutions,\nwas obliged to flee from his home at St Charles; and Dr Quesnel, one of\nthe magistrates of L'Acadie, had his house broken into by a mob that\ndemanded his resignation as magistrate.On November 6 rioting broke out in Montreal.The Doric Club, an\norganization of the young men of English blood in the city, came into\nconflict with the French-Canadian _Fils de la Liberte_.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the kitchen.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra left the milk.Which side\nprovoked the hostilities, it is now difficult to say.Certainly, both\nsides were to blame for their behaviour during the day.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the bedroom.The sons of\nliberty broke the windows of prominent loyalists; and the members of\nthe Doric Club completely wrecked {72} the office of the _Vindicator_\nnewspaper.It was only when the Riot Act was read, and the troops were\ncalled out, that the rioting ceased.Up to this point the _Patriotes_ had not indulged in any overt acts of\narmed rebellion.Some of their leaders, it is true, had been laying\nplans for a revolt.So much is known from the correspondence which\npassed between the leading _Patriotes_ in Lower Canada and William Lyon\nMackenzie, the leader of the rebellion in Upper Canada.Thomas Storrow\nBrown, one of Papineau's lieutenants, wrote to Mackenzie asking him to\nstart the ball rolling in Upper Canada first, in order to draw off some\nof the troops which Sir John Colborne had massed in Lower Canada.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra picked up the milk there.But\nall calculations were now upset by events which rapidly precipitated\nthe crisis in the lower province.Soon after the fracas in the streets of Montreal between the Doric Club\nand the _Fils de la Liberte_, a priest named Quibilier waited on\nPapineau, and advised him, since his presence in Montreal had become a\nsource of disturbance, to leave the city.Whether he came as an\nemissary from the ecclesiastical authorities or merely as a friend is\nnot clear.At any rate, Papineau accepted his advice, {73} and\nimmediately set out for St Hyacinthe.The government, thinking that Papineau had left the city for the\npurpose of stirring up trouble in the Richelieu district, promptly\nissued warrants for the arrest of Papineau and some of his chief\nlieutenants, Dr Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown, Edmund Bailey\nO'Callaghan, and several others.Meanwhile, on the day that these warrants for arrest were being issued\n(November 16), a skirmish took place between a small party of British\ntroopers and a band of _Patriotes_ on the road between Chambly and\nLongueuil--a skirmish which may be described as the Lexington of the\nLower Canada rebellion.If a young lady were to wish her father to pull her on the river, what\nclassical name might she mention?How do we know that Jupiter wore very pinching boots?Because we read\nof his struggles with the tight uns (Titans).What hairy Centaur could not possibly be spared from the story of\nHercules?The one that is--Nessus-hairy!To be said to your _inamorata_, your lady love: What's the difference\nbetween Jupiter and your very humble servant?Jupiter liked nectar and\nambrosia;

as well that I\nmight have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as\nwithout doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the\npublick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and\noftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first\nconceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing\nthem to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the\nPublick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,\nthose to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what\nuse of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published\nduring my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto\nperhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it\nwere, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of\nmispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for\nalthough it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in\nhim lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is\nproperly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought\nto reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those\nthings which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are\nalive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more\nadvantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that\nthe little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of\nwhat I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For\nit's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the\ntruth in Learning; as with those who beginning to grow rich, are less\ntroubled to make great purchases, then they were before when they were\npoorer, to make little ones.Or else one may compare them to Generals of\nArmies, whose Forces usually encrease porportionably to their Victories;\nand who have need of more conduct to maintain themselves after the loss\nof a battail, then after the gaining one, to take Towns and Provinces.For to endeavour to overcome all the difficulties and errours which\nhinder us to come to the knowledg of the Truth, is truly to fight\nbattails.And to receive any false opinion touching a generall or\nweighty matter, is as much as to lose one; there is far more dexterity\nrequired to recover our former condition, then to make great progresses\nwhere our Principles are already certain.For my part, if I formerly\nhave discovered some Truths in Learning, as I hope my Discourse will\nmake it appear I have, I may say, they are but the products and\ndependances of five or six principall difficulties which I have\novercome, and which I reckon for so many won Battails on my side.Neither will I forbear to say; That I think, It's only necessary for me\nto win two or three more such, wholly to perfect my design.And that I\nam not so old, but according to the ordinary course of Nature, I may\nhave time enough to effect it.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the hallway.But I beleeve I am so much the more\nobliged to husband the rest of my time, as I have more hopes to employ\nit well; without doubt, I should have divers occasions of impeding it,\nshould I publish the grounds of my Physicks.For although they are\nalmost all so evident, that to beleeve them, it's needfull onely to\nunderstand them; and that there is none whereof I think my self unable\nto give demonstration.Yet because it's impossible that they should\nagree with all the severall opinions of other men, I foresee I should\noften be diverted by the opposition they would occasion.It may be objected, These oppositions might be profitable, as well to\nmake me know my faults, as if any thing of mine were good to make others\nby that means come to a better understanding thereof; and as many may\nsee more then one man, beginning from this time to make use of my\ngrounds, they might also help me with their invention.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.But although I\nknow my self extremely subject to fail, and do never almost trust my\nfirst thoughts; yet the experience I have of the objections which may be\nmade unto me, hinder me from hoping for any profit from them; For I have\noften tried the judgments as well of those whom I esteem'd my friends,\nas of others whom I thought indifferent, and even also of some, whose\nmalignity and envie did sufficiently discover what the affection of my\nfriends might hide.But it seldom happened that any thing was objected\nagainst me, which I had not altogether foreseen, unless it were very\nremote from my Subject: So that I never almost met with any Censurer of\nmy opinions, that seemed unto me either less rigorous, or less equitable\nthen my self.Neither did I ever observe, that by the disputations\npracticed in the Schools any Truth which was formerly unknown, was ever\ndiscovered.For whilest every one seeks to overcome, men strive more to\nmaintain probabilities, then to weigh the reasons on both sides; and\nthose who for a long time have been good Advocates, are not therefore\nthe better Judges afterwards.As for the benefit which others may receive from the communication of my\nthoughts, it cannot also be very great, forasmuch as I have not yet\nperfected them, but that it is necessary to add many things thereunto,\nbefore a usefull application can be made of them.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the bedroom.And I think I may say\nwithout vanity, That if there be any one capable thereof, it must be my\nself, rather then any other.<|begin_of_text|>John moved to the garden.Not but that there may be divers wits in\nthe world incomparably better then mine; but because men cannot so well\nconceive a thing and make it their own, when they learn it of another,\nas when they invent it themselves: which is so true in this Subject,\nthat although I have often explain'd some of my opinions to very\nunderstanding men, and who, whilest I spake to them, seem'd very\ndistinctly to conceive them; yet when they repeated them, I observ'd,\nthat they chang'd them almost always in such a manner, that I could no\nlonger own them for mine.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.Upon which occasion, I shall gladly here\ndesire those who come after me, never to beleeve those things which may\nbe delivered to them for mine, when I have not published them my self.And I do not at all wonder at the extravagancies which are attributed to\nall those ancient Philosophers, whose Writings we have not; neither do I\nthereby judge, that their thoughts were very irrationall, seeing they\nwere the best Wits of their time; but onely that they have been ill\nconvey'd to us: as it appears also, that never any of their followers\nsurpass'd them.And I assure my self, that the most passionate of those,\nwho now follow _Aristotle_, would beleeve himself happy, had he but as\nmuch knowledge of Nature as he had, although it were on condition that\nhe never might have more: They are like the ivie, which seeks to climb\nno higher then the trees which support it, and ever after tends\ndownwards again when it hath attain'd to the height thereof: for, me\nthinks also, that such men sink downwards; that is to say, render\nthemselves in some manner lesse knowing, then if they did abstain from\nstudying; who being not content to know all which is intelligibly set\ndown in their Authour, will besides that, finde out the solution of\ndivers difficulties of which he says nothing, and perhaps never thought\nof them: yet their way of Philosophy is very fit for those who have but\nmean capacities: For the obscurity of the distinctions and principles\nwhich they use causeth them to speak of all things as boldly, as if they\nknew them, and maintain all which they say, against the most subtill and\nmost able; so that there is no means left to convince them.Wherein they\nseem like to a blinde man, who, to fight without disadvantage against\none that sees, should challenge him down into the bottom of a very dark\ncellar: And I may say, that it is these mens interest, that I should\nabstain from publishing the principles of the Philosophy I use, for\nbeing most simple and most evident, as they are, I should even do the\nsame in publishing of them, as if I opened some windows, to let the day\ninto this cellar, into which they go down to fight.But even the best\nWits have no reason to wish for the knowledge of them: for if they will\nbe able to speak of all things, and acquire the reputation of being\nlearned, they will easily attain to it by contenting themselves with\nprobability, which without much trouble may be found in all kinde of\nmatters; then in seeking the Truth, which discovers it self but by\nlittle and little, in some few things; and which, when we are to speak\nof others, oblige us freely to confesse our ignorance of them.But if\nthey prefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of seeming to\nbe ignorant of nothing, as without doubt they ought to do, and will\nundertake a designe like mine, I need not tell them any more for this\npurpose, but what I have already said in this Discourse: For if they\nhave a capacity to advance farther then I have done, they may with\ngreater consequence finde out of themselves whatsoever I think I have\nfound; Forasmuch as having never examined any thing but by order, it's\ncertain, that what remains yet for me to discover, is in it self more\ndifficult and more hid, then what I have already here before met with;\nand they would receive much less satisfaction in learning it from me,\nthen from themselves.Besides that, the habit which they would get by\nseeking first of all the easie things, and passing by degrees to others\nmore difficult, will be more usefull to them, then all my instructions.As I for my part am perswaded, that had I been taught from my youth all\nthe Truths whose demonstrations I have discovered since, and had taken\nno pains to learn them, perhaps I should never have known any other, or\nat least, I should never have acquired that habit, and that faculty\nwhich I think I have, still to finde out new ones, as I apply my self to\nthe search of them.And in a word, if there be in the world any work\nwhich cannot be so well ended by any other, as by the same who began it,\nit's that which I am now about.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the hallway.It's true, That one man will not be sufficient to make all the\nexperiments which may conduce thereunto: But withall, he cannot\nprofitably imploy other hands then his own, unlesse it be those of\nArtists, or others whom he hires, and whom the hope of profit (which is\na very powerfull motive) might cause exactly to do all those things he\nshould appoint them: For as for voluntary persons, who by curiosity or a\ndesire to learn, would perhaps offer themselves to his help, besides\nthat commonly they promise more then they perform, and make onely fair\npropositions, whereof none ever succeeds, they would infallibly be paid\nby the solution of some difficulties, or at least by complements and\nunprofitable entertainments, which could not cost him so little of his\ntime, but he would be a loser thereby.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the apple there.And for the Experiments which\nothers have already made, although they would even communicate them to\nhim (which those who call them Secrets would never do,) they are for\nthe most part composed of so many circumstances, or superfluous\ningredients, that it would be very hard for him to decypher the truth of\nthem: Besides, he would find them all so ill exprest, or else so false,\nby reason that those who made them have laboured to make them appear\nconformable to their principles; that if there were any which served\ntheir turn, they could not at least be worth the while which must be\nimployed in the choice of them.So that, if there were any in the world\nthat were certainly known to be capable of finding out the greatest\nthings, and the most profitable for the Publick which could be, and that\nother men would therefore labour alwayes to assist him to accomplish his\nDesignes; I do not conceive that they could do more for him, then\nfurnish the expence of the experiments whereof he stood in need; and\nbesides, take care only that he may not be by any body hindred of his\ntime.But besides that, I do not presume so much of my Self, as to\npromise any thing extraordinary, neither do I feed my self with such\nvain hopes, as to imagine that the Publick should much interesse it self\nin my designes; I have not so base a minde, as to accept of any favour\nwhatsoever, which might be thought I had not deserved.All these considerations joyned together, were the cause three years\nsince why I would not divulge the Treatise I had in hand; and which is\nmore, that I resolved to publish none whilest I lived, which might be so\ngeneral, as that the Grounds of my Philosophy might be understood\nthereby.But since, there hath been two other reasons have obliged me to\nput forth some particular Essays, and to give the Publick some account\nof my Actions and Designes.The first was, that if I failed therein,\ndivers who knew the intention I formerly had to print some of my\nWritings, might imagine that the causes for which I forbore it, might\nbe more to my disadvantage then they are.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the kitchen.For although I do not affect\nglory in excess; or even, (if I may so speak) that I hate it, as far as\nI judge it contrary to my rest, which I esteem above all things: Yet\nalso did I never seek to hide my actions as crimes, neither have I been\nvery wary to keep my self unknown; as well because I thought I might\nwrong my self, as that it might in some manner disquiet me, which would\nagain have been contrary to the perfect repose of my minde which I seek.And because having alwayes kept my self indifferent, caring not whether\nI were known or no, I could not chuse but get some kinde of reputation,\nI thought that I ought to do my best to hinder it at least from being\nill.The other reason which obliged me to write this, is, that observing\nevery day more and more the designe I have to instruct my self, retarded\nby reason of an infinite number of experiments which are needful to me,\nand which its impossible for me to make without the help of others;\nalthough I do not so much flatter my self, as to hope that the Publick,\nshares much in my concernments; yet will I not also be so much wanting\nto my self, as to give any cause to those who shall survive me, to\nreproach this, one day to me, That I could have left them divers things\nfar beyond what I have done, had I not too much neglected to make them\nunderstand wherein they might contribute to my designe.<|begin_of_text|>John went to the hallway.And I thought it easie for me to choose some matters, which being not\nsubject to many Controversies, nor obliging me to declare any more of my\nPrinciples then I would willingly, would neverthelesse expresse clearly\nenough, what my abilities or defects are in the Sciences.Wherein I\ncannot say whether I have succeeded or no; neither will I prevent the\njudgment of any man by speaking of my own Writings: but I should be\nglad they might be examin'd; and to that end I beseech all those who\nhave any objections to make, to take the pains to send them to my\nStationer, that I being advertised by him, may endeavour at the same\ntime to adjoyn", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "For\nI promise, that I will never make any long Answers, but only very freely\nconfesse my own faults, if I find them; or if I cannot discover them,\nplainly say what I shal think requisite in defence of what I have writ,\nwithout adding the explanation of any new matter, that I may not\nendlesly engage my self out of one into another.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the hallway.Now if there be any whereof I have spoken in the beginning, of the\nOpticks and of the Meteors, which at first jarr, by reason that I call\nthem Suppositions, and that I seem not willing to prove them; let a man\nhave but the patience to read the whole attentively, and I hope he will\nrest satisfied: For (me thinks) the reasons follow each other so\nclosely, that as the later are demonstrated by the former, which are\ntheir Causes; the former are reciprocally proved by the later, which are\ntheir Effects.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the milk there.And no man can imagine that I herein commit the fault\nwhich the Logicians call a _Circle_; for experience rendring the\ngreatest part of these effects most certain, the causes whence I deduce\nthem serve not so much to prove, as to explain them; but on the\ncontrary, they are those which are proved by them.Neither named I them\nSuppositions, that it might be known that I conceive my self able to\ndeduce them from those first Truths which I have before discovered: But\nthat I would not expresly do it to crosse certain spirits, who imagine\nthat they know in a day al what another may have thought in twenty\nyeers, as soon as he hath told them but two or three words; and who are\nso much the more subject to erre, and less capable of the Truth, (as\nthey are more quick and penetrating) from taking occasion of erecting\nsome extravagant Philosophy on what they may beleeve to be my\nPrinciples, and lest the fault should be attributed to me.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.For as for\nthose opinions which are wholly mine, I excuse them not as being new,\nbecause that if the reasons of them be seriously considered, I assure my\nself, they will be found so plain, and so agreeable to common sense,\nthat they will seem less extraordinary and strange then any other which\nmay be held on the same Subjects.Neither do I boast that I am the first\nInventor of any of them; but of this indeed, that I never admitted any\nof them, neither because they had, or had not been said by others, but\nonly because Reason perswaded me to them.<|begin_of_text|>John went back to the bathroom.If Mechanicks cannot so soon put in practise the Invention which is set\nforth in the Opticks, I beleeve that therefore men ought not to condemn\nit; forasmuch as skill and practice are necessary for the making and\ncompleating the Machines I have described; so that no circumstance\nshould be wanting.I should no less wonder if they should succeed at\nfirst triall, then if a man should learn in a day to play excellently\nwell on a Lute, by having an exact piece set before him.And if I write\nin French, which is the language of my Country, rather then in Latin,\nwhich is that of my Tutors, 'tis because I hope such who use their meer\nnaturall reason, wil better judge of my opinions, then those who only\nbeleeve in old Books.And for those who joyn a right understanding with\nstudy, (who I only wish for my Judges) I assure my self, they will not\nbe so partiall to the Latin, as to refuse to read my reasons because I\nexpresse them in a vulgar tongue.To conclude, I will not speak here in particular of the progresse I\nhoped to make hereafter in Learning; Nor engage my self by any promise\nto the Publick, which I am not certain to perform.<|begin_of_text|>John grabbed the apple there.But I shall onely\nsay, That I am resolved to employ the remainder of my life in no other\nthing but the study to acquire some such knowledge of Nature as may\nfurnish us with more certain rules in Physick then we hitherto have had:\nAnd that my inclination drives me so strongly from all other kind of\ndesignes, chiefly from those which cannot be profitable to any, but by\nprejudicing others;

Douglas, however, seemed anything but baffled\nas he rose to reply.As he waited for the cheers which greeted him to\ndie out, his attitude was easy and indifferent, as a public man's should\nbe.The question seemed not to trouble him in the least.But for Stephen\nBrice the Judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him, even\nas Abraham Lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors,\nand left it punily naked.Standing up, the very person of the Little Giant was contradictory, as\nwas the man himself.But he had the head\nand shoulders of a lion, and even the lion's roar.What at contrast the\nring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of Mr.If Stephen expected the Judge to tremble, he was greatly\ndisappointed.As if to show the people\nhow lightly he held his opponent's warnings, he made them gape by\nputting things down Mr.Lincoln's shirt-front and taking them out of his\nmouth: But it appeared to Stephen, listening with all his might, that\nthe Judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might\nlead one to expect.Was he not among his own Northern Democrats at\nFreeport?And yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his\nhearers \"Black Republicans.\"\"Not black,\" came from the crowd again\nand again, and once a man: shouted, \"Couldn't you modify it and call\nit brown?\"cried the Judge, and dubbed them \"Yankees,\"\nalthough himself a Vermonter by birth.He implied that most of these\nBlack Republicans desired <DW64> wives.But quick,--to the Question, How was the Little Giant, artful in debate\nas he was, to get over that without offence to the great South?Very\nskillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations.And\nthen, save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees, the grove might\nhave been empty of its thousands, such was the silence that fell.But\ntighter and tighter they pressed against the stand, until it trembled.Oh, Judge, the time of all artful men will come at length.How were you\nto foresee a certain day under the White Dome of the Capitol?<|begin_of_text|>John discarded the apple.Had your\nsight been long, you would have paused before your answer.Had your\nsight been long, you would have seen this ugly Lincoln bareheaded before\nthe Nation, and you are holding his hat.Judge Douglas, this act alone\nhas redeemed your faults.It has given you a nobility of which we did\nnot suspect you.At the end God gave you strength to be humble, and so\nyou left the name of a patriot.Judge, you thought there was a passage between Scylla and Charybdis\nwhich your craftiness might overcome.\"It matters not,\" you cried when you answered the Question, \"it matters\nnot which way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract\nquestion whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under\nthe Constitution.The people have the lawful means to introduce or to\nexclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist\na day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police\nregulations.\"Judge Douglas, uneasy will you lie to-night, for you have uttered the\nFreeport Heresy.It only remains to be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster\nHouse after the debate, found Mr.On his knee, in transports\nof delight, was a small boy, and Mr.Lincoln was serenely playing on\nthe child's Jew's-harp.Standing beside him was a proud father who had\ndragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who was to\nreturn on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the milk.In a\ncorner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who\nwished to talk about the Question.Lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome\nthat is still, and ever will be, remembered and cherished.<|begin_of_text|>John got the apple there.\"Tell Judge Whipple that I have attended to that little matter, Steve,\"\nhe said.Lincoln,\" he exclaimed, \"you have had no time.\"Lincoln replied, \"and I think that I am\nwell repaid.Steve,\" said he, \"unless I'm mightily mistaken, you know a\nlittle more than you did yesterday.\"Didn't you feel sorry for\nme last night?\"\"I never shall again, sir,\" he said.The wonderful smile, so ready to come and go, flickered and went out.In\nits stead on the strange face was ineffable sadness,--", "question": "Where is the milk?

hopes of you, Stephen,\" he said.Why was it that he walked to the station with a\nheavy heart?It was a sense of the man he had left, who had been and was\nto be.This Lincoln of the black loam, who built his neighbor's cabin\nand hoed his neighbor's corn, who had been storekeeper and postmaster\nand flat-boatman.Who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice\naround a rough circuit; who had rolled a local bully in the dirt;\nrescued women from insult; tended the bedside of many a sick coward who\nfeared the Judgment; told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight (but\nthese are pure beside the vice of great cities); who addressed political\nmobs in the raw, swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers\neast and west.This physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the\nNation in her agony; whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse, and\nwhose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing.So was it that, the Physician Himself performed His cures, and when work\nwas done, died a martyr.Abraham Lincoln died in His name\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.GLENCOE\n\nIt was nearly noon when Stephen walked into the office the next day,\ndusty and travel-worn and perspiring.He had come straight from the\nferry, without going home.And he had visions of a quiet dinner with\nRichter under the trees at the beer-garden, where he could talk about\nAbraham Lincoln.But the young German met him at the top of the stair--and his face was\nmore serious than usual, although he showed his magnificent teeth in a\nsmile of welcome.<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the garden.\"You are a little behind your time, my friend,\" said he, \"What has\nhappened you?\"\"Ah, I know not,\" he answered, \"He has gone is Glencoe.Doctor Polk says that he has worked all his life too hard.<|begin_of_text|>Mary moved to the hallway.The Doctor and Colonel Carvel tried to get him to go to Glencoe.But\nhe would not budge until Miss Carvel herself comes all the way from the\ncountry yesterday, and orders him.exclaimed Richter, impulsively,\n\"what wonderful women you have in America!I could lose my head when I\nthink of Miss Carvel.\"\"Miss Carvel was here, you say?\"said Richter, disgusted, \"you don't care.\"And becoming grave again, added: \"Except on\nJudge Whipple's account.Have you heard from him to-day, Carl?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary got the football there.\"This morning one of Colonel Carvel's servants came for his letters.I--I pray that he is better,\" said Richter, his\nvoice breaking.But he had been conscious all at once of an\naffection for the Judge of which he had not suspected himself.That\nafternoon, on his way home, he stopped at Carvel & Company's to inquire.Hopper said, and added that he \"presumed\nlikely the Colonel would not be in for a week.\"Eliphalet was actually in the Colonel's sanctum behind the partition,\ngiving orders to several clerks at the time.He was so prosperous and\nimportant that he could scarce spare a moment to answer Stephen, who\nwent away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law.On Monday, when Stephen called at Carvel & Company's, Eliphalet was too\nbusy to see him.But Ephum, who went out to Glencoe every night with\norders, told him that the \"Jedge was wuss, suh.\"On Wednesday, there\nbeing little change, Mrs.Brice ventured to despatch a jelly by Ephum.On Friday afternoon, when Stephen was deep in Whittlesey and the New\nCode, he became aware of Ephum standing beside him.In reply to his\nanxious question Ephum answered:\n\n\"I reckon he better, suh.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.He an' de Colonel done commence wrastlin'\n'bout a man name o' Linkum.De Colonel done wrote you dis note, suh.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.It was a very polite note, containing the Colonel's compliments, asking\nMr.Brice to Glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the\nJudge might wish to see.And since there was no convenient train in the\nevening, Colonel Carvel would feel honored if Mr.The Missouri side of the Mississippi is a very different country from\nthe hot and treeless prairies of Illinois.As Stephen alighted at the\nlittle station at Glencoe and was driven away by Ned in the Colonel's\nbuggy, he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the Meramec Valley.There had been a shower, and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and\nflowers, and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road.At last they\ncame to a white gate in the picket fence, in sight of a rambling wooden\nhouse with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle.And then he saw\nthe Colonel, in white marseilles, smoking a cigar.As Stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward\nthe house, Colonel Carvel rose to his full height and greeted him.\"You are very welcome, sir,\" he said gravely.\"I regret to say that we had a little argument this morning,\nand my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again to-day.Jinny is reading to him now, or she would be here to entertain you, Mr.Jackson appeared hurriedly, seized Stephen's bag, and led the way\nupstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on\nthe south side, with matting, and roses on the simple dressing-table.After he had sat awhile staring at these, and at the wet flower-garden\nfrom between the slats of his shutters, he removed the signs of the\nrailroad upon him, and descended.The Colonel was still on the porch, in\nhis easy-chair.He had lighted another, cigar, and on the stand beside\nhim stood two tall glasses, green with the fresh mint.Colonel Carvel\nrose, and with his own hand offered one to Stephen.Brice,\" he said, \"and I hope you will feel at home\nhere, sir.Jackson will bring you anything you desire, and should you\nwish to drive, I shall be delighted to show you the country.\"Stephen drank that julep with reverence, and then the Colonel gave him\na cigar.He was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young\nYankee.The Colonel did not talk politics--such was not his notion of\nhospitality to a stranger.He talked horse, and no great discernment on\nStephen's part was needed to perceive that this was Mr.Brice, before they ruined gentleman's\nsport with these trotters ten years ago.Yes sir, we used to be at\nLexington one week, and Louisville the next, and over here on the Ames\ntrack after that.Did you ever hear of Water Witch and Netty Boone?\"\"Why, sir,\" he cried, \"that very <DW65>, Ned, who drove you here from\nthe cars-he used to ride Netty Boone.He was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the Elleardsville track\nhere.He wore my yellow and green, sir, until he got to weigh one\nhundred and a quarter.And I kept him down to that weight a whole year,\nMr.I had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with\nholes bored in the seat.Then we lighted a spirit lamp under him.Many\na time I took off ten pounds that way.It needs fire to get flesh off a\n<DW65>, sir.\"He didn't notice his guest's amazement.\"Then, sir,\" he continued, \"they introduced these damned trotting races;\ntrotting races are for white trash, Mr.I wish you\ncould have seen Miss Virginia Carvel as he saw her then.A tea-tray was in her hand, and her head was tilted\nback, as women are apt to do when they carry a burden.It was so that\nthese Southern families, who were so bitter against Abolitionists and\nYankees, entertained them when they were poor, and nursed them when they\nwere ill.Stephen, for his life, could not utter a word.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the bedroom.But Virginia turned to\nhim with perfect self-possession.\"He has been boring you with his horses, Mr.\"Has he\ntold you what a jockey Ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and\na quarter?\"\"Has he given you the points of Water Witch and\nNetty Boone?\"\"Pa, I tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this\nhouse.O that you might have a notion of the way in which Virginia pronounced\nintolerable.Carvel reached for another cigar asked, \"My dear,\" he asked, \"how is\nthe Judge?\"\"My dear,\" said Virginia, smiling, \"he is asleep.Mammy Easter is with\nhim, trying to make out what he is saying.He talks in his sleep, just\nas you do--\"\n\n\"And what is he saying?\"\"'A house divided against itself,'\" said Miss Carvel, with a sweep of\nher arm, \"'cannot stand.I believe that this Government cannot endure\npermanently, half slave and half free.I do not expect the Union to\ndissolve--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will\ncease to be divided.'\"No,\" cried the Colonel, and banged his fist down on the table.\"Why,\"\nsaid he, thoughtfully, stroking the white goatee on his chin, \"cuss me\nif that ain't from the speech that country bumpkin, Lincoln, made in\nJune last before the Black Republican convention in Illinois.\"And Stephen was very near it, for\nhe loved the Colonel.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the football.That gentleman suddenly checked himself in his\ntirade, and turned to him.\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said; \"I reckon that you have the same\npolitical sentiments as the Judge.Believe me, sir, I would not\nwillingly offend a guest.\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.\"I am not offended, sir,\" he said.Carvel to bestow a quick glance upon him.\"You will pardon my absence for a while, sir,\" he said.In silence they watched him as he strode off under the trees through\ntall grass, a yellow setter at his heels.The shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long, and\na rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air.From a cabin\nbehind the house was wafted the melody of a plantation song.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the hallway.To\nthe young man, after the burnt city, this was paradise.And then he\nremembered his mother as she must be sitting on the tiny porch in\ntown, and sighed.Only two years ago she had been at their own place at\nWestbury.He looked up, and saw the girl watching him.He dared not think that the\nexpression he caught was one of sympathy, for it changed instantly.\"I am afraid you are the silent kind, Mr.Brice,\" said she; \"I believe\nit is a Yankee trait.\"\"I have known a great many who were not,\" said he, \"When they are\ngarrulous, they are very much so.\"\"I should prefer a garrulous one,\" said Virginia.\"I should think a Yankee were bad enough, but a noisy Yankee not to be\nput up with,\" he ventured.Virginia did not deign a direct reply to this, save by the corners of\nher mouth.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the football there.\"I wonder,\" said she, thoughtfully, \"whether it is strength of mind or a\nlack of ideas that makes them silent.\"\"You have not always shown it,\" she said, with an innocence which in\nwomen is often charged with meaning.He would have liked\ngreatly to know whether she referred to his hasty purchase of Hester, or\nto his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the football.\"We have something left to be thankful for,\" he answered.\"On occasions it is violence,\" said Virginia, desperately.This man must\nnot get ahead of her.\"It is just as violent,\" said he, \"as the repressed feeling which\nprompts it.\"This was a new kind of conversation to Virginia.Of all the young men\nshe knew, not one had ever ventured into anything of the sort.They were\neither flippant, or sentimental, or both.She was at once flattered\nand annoyed, flattered, because, as a woman, Stephen had conceded her\na mind.Many of the young men she knew had minds, but deemed that these\nwere wasted on women, whose language was generally supposed to be a kind\nof childish twaddle.Even Jack Brinsmade rarely risked his dignity\nand reputation at an intellectual tilt.This was one of Virginia's\ngrievances.She often argued with her father, and, if the truth were\ntold, had had more than one victory over Judge Whipple.Virginia's annoyance came from the fact that she perceived in Stephen\na natural and merciless logic,--a faculty for getting at the bottom\nof things.His brain did not seem to be thrown out of gear by local\nmagnetic influences,--by beauty, for instance.He did not lose his head,\nas did some others she knew, at the approach of feminine charms.Here\nwas a grand subject, then, to try the mettle of any woman.One with\nless mettle would have given it up.But Virginia thought it would be\ndelightful to bring this particular Yankee to his knees; and--and leave\nhim there.Brice,\" she said, \"I have not spoken to you since the night of my\nparty.\"Yes, we did,\" said he, \"and I called, but was unfortunate.\"\"Jackson is so careless with cards,\" said she, \"and very often I do not\ntake the trouble to read them.\"\"I am sorry,\" said he, \"as I wished for the opportunity to tell you how\nmuch I enjoyed myself.She remembered how, she had opposed his\nconing.But honesty as well as something else prompted her to say: \"It\nwas my father who invited you.\"Stephen did not reveal the shock his vanity had received.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the garden.\"At least you were good enough to dance with me.\"\"I could scarcely refuse a guest,\" she replied.\"Had I thought it would have given you annoyance,\" he said quietly, \"I\nshould not have asked you.\"\"Which would have been a lack of good manners,\" said Virginia, biting\nher lips.Stephen answered nothing, but wished himself in St.He could not\ncomprehend her cruelty.But, just then, the bell rang for supper, and\nthe Colonel appeared around the end of the house.It was one of those suppers for which the South is renowned.And when\nat length he could induce Stephen to eat no more, Colonel Carvel reached\nfor his broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat smoking, with his feet against\nthe mantle.Virginia, who had talked but little, disappeared with a tray\non which she had placed with her own hands some dainties to tempt the\nJudge.The Colonel regaled Stephen, when she was gone, with the pedigree and\nperformance of every horse he had had in his stable.And this was a\nrelief, as it gave him an opportunity to think without interruption upon\nVirginia's pronounced attitude of dislike.To him it was inconceivable\nthat a young woman of such qualities as she appeared to have, should\nassail him so persistently for freeing a negress, and so depriving her\nof a maid she had set her heart upon.There were other New England young\nmen in society.They were not\nher particular friends, to be sure.But they called on her and danced\nwith her, and she had shown them not the least antipathy.But it was to\nStephen's credit that he did not analyze her further.He was reflecting on these things when he got to his room, when there\ncame a knock at the door.It was Mammy Easter, in bright turban and\napron,--was hospitality and comfort in the flesh.\"Is you got all you need, suh?\"But Mammy showed no inclination to go, and\nhe was too polite to shut the door:\n\n\"How you like Glencoe, Mistah Bride?\"\"We has some of de fust fam'lies out heah in de summer,\" said she.\"But\nde Colonel, he a'n't much on a gran' place laik in Kaintuck.Shucks, no,\nsuh, dis ain't much of a'stablishment!Young Massa won't have no law", "question": "Where is the football? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>kitchen"}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|>Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.He say he laik it wil' and simple.He on'y\ncome out fo' two months, mebbe.But Miss Jinny, she make it lively.Las'\nweek, until the Jedge come we hab dis house chuck full, two-three young\nladies in a room, an' five young gemmen on trunnle beds.\"Den Miss Jinny low dey all hatter go.She say she

up,\nsuh!She des swep' 'em all out\" (Mammy emphasized this by rolling her\nhands) \"an' declah she gwine ten' to the Jedge herself.She a'n't never\nlet me bring up one of his meals, suh.\"And so she left Stephen with\nsome food for reflection.Virginia was very gay at breakfast, and said that the Judge would see\nStephen; so he and the Colonel, that gentleman with his hat on, went\nup to his room.The shutters were thrown open, and the morning sunlight\nfiltered through the leaves and fell on the four-poster where the Judge\nsat up, gaunt and grizzled as ever.He smiled at his host, and then\ntried to destroy immediately the effect of the smile.\"Well, Judge,\" cried the Colonel, taking his hand, \"I reckon we talked\ntoo much.\"\"No such thing, Carvel,\" said the Judge, forcibly, \"if you hadn't\nleft the room, your popular sovereignty would have been in rags in two\nminutes.\"Stephen sat down in a corner, unobserved, in expectation of a renewal.But at this moment Miss Virginia swept into the room, very cool in a\npink muslin.\"Colonel Carvel,\" said she, sternly, \"I am the doctor's deputy here.I\nwas told to keep the peace at any cost.And if you answer back, out you\ngo, like that!\"But the Judge, whose mind was on the argument,\ncontinued to mutter defiantly until his eye fell upon Stephen.\"Well, sir, well, sir,\" he said, \"you've turned up at last, have you?I send you off with papers for a man, and I get back a piece of yellow\npaper saying that he's borrowed you.\"He took me to Freeport, sir, where I listened to the most remarkable\nspeech I ever expect to hear.\"cried the Judge, \"so far from Boston?\"<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the garden.Stephen hesitated, uncertain whether to laugh, until he chanced to look\nat Virginia.\"I was very much surprised, sir,\" he said.Whipple, \"and what did you chink of that ruffian,\nLincoln?\"\"He is the most remarkable man that I have ever met, sir,\" answered\nStephen, with emphasis.It seemed as if the grunt this time had in it something of approval.Stephen had doubt as to the propriety of discussing Mr.Virginia's expression bore a trace of defiance, and Mr.Carvel stood with his feet apart, thoughtfully stroking his goatee.\"You must agree with\nthat laudatory estimation of him which I read in the Missouri Democrat.\"\"I do, sir, most decidedly,\" he answered.\"I should hardly expect a conservative Bostonian, of the class which\nrespects property, to have said that.It might possibly be a good thing\nif more from your town could hear those debates.\"\"They will read them, sir; I feel confident of it.\"At this point the Colonel could contain himself no longer.\"I reckon I might tell the man who wrote that Democrat article a few\nthings, if I could find out who he is,\" said he.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the hallway.But Stephen had turned a fiery red, \"I wrote it, Colonel Carvel,\" he\nsaid.For a dubious instant of silence Colonel Carvel stared.Then--then he\nslapped his knees, broke into a storm of laughter, and went out of the\nroom.He left Stephen in a moist state of discomfiture.The Judge had bolted upright from the pillows.<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the garden.\"You have been neglecting your law, sir,\" he cried.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the bathroom.\"I wrote the article at night,\" said Stephen, indignantly.\"Then it must have been Sunday night, Mr.At this point Virginia hid her face in her handkerchief which trembled\nvisibly.Being a woman, whose ways are unaccountable, the older man took\nno notice of her.But being a young woman, and a pretty one, Stephen was\nangry.\"I don't see what right you have to ask me that sir,\" he said.Brice,\" said the Judge, \"Virginia, you\nmay strike it from the records.And now, sir, tell me something about\nyour trip.\"An hour later Stephen descended to the veranda, and it was with\napprehension that he discerned Mr.Carvel seated under the vines at the\nfar end.To Stephen's surprise the Colonel rose, and, coming toward him, laid a\nkindly hand on his shoulder.\"Stephen,\" said he, \"there will be no law until Monday you must stay\nwith us until then.I shall have to go by the two o'clock train, I\nfear.\"The Colonel turned to Virginia, who, meanwhile, had sat silently by.\"Jinny,\" he said, \"we must contrive to keep him.\"\"I'm afraid he is determined, Pa,\" she answered.Brice\nwould like to see a little of the place before he goes.It is very\nprimitive,\" she explained, \"not much like yours in the East.\"Stephen thanked her, and bowed to the Colonel.And so she led him past\nthe low, crooked outbuildings at the back, where he saw old Uncle\nBen busy over the preparation of his dinner, and frisky Rosetta, his\ndaughter, playing with one of the Colonel's setters.Then Virginia took\na well-worn path, on each side of which the high grass bent with its\nload of seed, which entered the wood.Oaks and hickories and walnuts\nand persimmons spread out in a glade, and the wild grape twisted\nfantastically around the trunks.All this beauty seemed but a fit\nsetting to the strong girlish figure in the pink frock before him.So absorbed was he in contemplation of this, and in wondering whether\nindeed she were to marry her cousin, Clarence Colfax, that he did not\nsee the wonders of view unrolling in front of him.She stopped at length\nbeside a great patch of wild race bushes.They were on the edge of the\nbluff, and in front of them a little rustic summer-house, with seats on\nits five sides.But Stephen, going to the edge,\nstood and marvelled.Far, far below him, down the wooded steep, shot\nthe crystal Meramec, chafing over the shallow gravel beds and tearing\nheadlong at the deep passes.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went to the kitchen.Beyond, the dimpled green hills rose and fell, and the stream ran indigo\nand silver.A hawk soared over the water, the only living creature in\nall that wilderness.And when at length he turned,\nhe saw that the girl was watching him.Virginia had taken other young men here, and they had looked only upon\nher.This sincerity now was as new to her\nas that with which he had surprised her in the Judge's room.A reply to those simple words of his\nwas impossible.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra grabbed the milk there.At honest Tom Catherwood in the same situation she would\nhave laughed, Clarence never so much as glanced at scenery.Her replies\nto him were either flippant, or else maternal, as to a child.A breeze laden with the sweet abundance of that valley stirred her hair.That hearty look of approval which used\nto dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part\nof his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of\nLouise.\"It's unfortunate,\" was all that he thought to himself, and\ntherewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the\nconsideration of what, if anything, was to be done.<|begin_of_text|>Mary took the apple there.\"I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or\nThursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough,\" he said to Jennie after he\nhad returned.\"I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his\nbag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a\nsullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all\nover, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of\nmaking a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the\nother, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any\nother member of the family was at all likely to seek another\nconference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as\nusual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;\ncertainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the\nconsciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed\nupon him.\"Bad business,\" he meditated--\"bad business.\"For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs\ncontinued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important\nbusiness conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it\noff quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed\nhim affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his\ncustomary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,\nconcertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore\nthe one real issue.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra discarded the milk.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it\npersisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far\nbetween as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nIn the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her\nown.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,\nwhich had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought\nof her.She had yielded on two\noccasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought\nout differently.If she did not\nalways have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her\nmind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for\nhim.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to\nCleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet\nthe thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had\nbeen so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would\nreceive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a\nlittle money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly\nfifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they\nhad lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent\ntwenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of\neverything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The\nrent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She\nthought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the\nthought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,\ntrying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that\nhe himself might wish it.Since the\nscene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little\ndifferent.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied\nwith the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had\nplainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on\nthat score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the\npresence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever\nmarrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.<|begin_of_text|>Mary discarded the apple there.And he\nwas so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided\nif she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then\nmaybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing\nmore about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since\nJennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in\nthe public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and\nthey were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a\nlittle ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she\nwas anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely\nnotified the members of the family of the approaching\nmarriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she\ninvited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented\nthe slight.He had had too many\nrebuffs.She hoped that life would give her an\nopportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind\nparticularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an\nelectrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had\npointed out to him as being attractive and promising.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra took the milk there.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note\nfrom Veronica giving her the main details.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.She was glad from one point\nof view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away\nfrom her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to\nreside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of\nGerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the\nother children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from\nwhich he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a\nclose for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The\nearthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw\nSebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring\nhim, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have\ntaken a dollar from Jennie.They\nobjected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to\nlive on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being\ncome by honestly.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the bathroom.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true\nrelations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be\nmarried, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the\nhumbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of\ntelling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same\nthing.Gerhardt had never had sight\nof her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been\nmarried, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and\ncrotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live\nwith him.They resented the way in which\nhe took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them\nof spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a\nsmaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of\nthe money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order\nto repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this\nway, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to\nredeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt\nthat he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity\nfrom one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not\nleading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his\ncomplaining brother and sister on condition that they should get\nsomething to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited\nthem to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed\nthem for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and\nlive with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of\nthe mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some\nout-of-the-way garret.And this would\nsave him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this<|begin_of_text|>Sandra moved to the office.", "question": "Where is the apple? ", "target": "<|begin_of_text|>bathroom"}, {"input": "He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from\nthe tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the\nbusiness center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional \"By chops!\"or \"So it is\" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would\nreturn, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of\nduty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,\nsuch as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a\npeculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the\nworry, and the grieving?People die; you hear\nnothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He\nbelieved there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had\nsinned woefully.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.He believed that the just would be rewarded in\nheaven.Sebastian\nwas a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his\nfather.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass\nwalked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.George had\ncontributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so\nlong as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His\nvery existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his\nchildren?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he\ndid not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they\nwere not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.<|begin_of_text|>Mary travelled to the garden.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for\nsome time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her\nleaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After\nVeronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no\nneed of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to\nlive with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would\nlive there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had\nsaved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that\nhe would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was\nnot sure but what it might be all right--her father was so\ndetermined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must\nmean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,\nhesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,\nwhether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well\nthey would have a difficult time.If she could get five\nor six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen\ndollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst\ndifficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nThe trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take\ninto consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an\nelemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the\nconventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved\nher well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her\nanomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he\nhad chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too\nfar, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this\nparticular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of\nwomanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own\nplane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one\nwho appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,\ngracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the\nlittle customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a\ncompanion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was\nsatisfied--why seek further?<|begin_of_text|>Daniel got the football there.But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing\nout her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally\nworded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:\n\n\"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you\nnot to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking\nVesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,\nand my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever\nwant me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly\nable to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,\nin spite of myself.\"You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more\nand that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't\nthink just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from\nyou.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in\nthe house to eat.My brother George\ndidn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often\nthought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she\nmight be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked\nyou--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much\ndifference about me.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel discarded the football there.You know you told me right away you would like to\nhelp my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to\ndo.\"Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,\nbut if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive\nme.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever\nsince your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I\noughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It\nwas wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but\nI was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was\nwrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I\nthought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me\nto keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of\nyou then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister\nLouise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never\nbeen able to think right about it since.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel grabbed the football there.It can't be right, Lester,\nbut I don't blame you.\"I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me\nand how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be\nright.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I\nshould ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living\nthis way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She\nthinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so\nmuch.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you\nabout it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem\nto be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write\nyou this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for\nme.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't\nthink of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I\ndo--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for\nme.I wish you all the luck that can come to you.\"P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you\nshouldn't.\"<|begin_of_text|>Daniel went back to the garden.She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in\nher bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could\nconveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual\nexecution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned\nthat he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary\ngarments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an\nexpressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was\ncoming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as\nwell to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the\nfurniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t\nhad written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door\nopened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in\nthe least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings\nhad served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's\nduck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of\nChicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out\nto the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home\nso early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle\nof the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed\nand ready to depart?He stared in\namazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry.\"Why--why--\" she began, falling back.\"I thought I would go to Cleveland,\" she replied.\"Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't\nthink I ought to stay here any longer this way.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel left the football.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't.\"There,\" she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table\nwhere the letter lay conspicuous on a large book.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra travelled to the bathroom.\"And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a\nletter?\"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke.\"I\nswear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the\nenvelope and looked at the beginning.\"Better send Vesta from the\nroom,\" he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,\nlooking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the\npaper on the floor.\"Well, I'll tell you, Jennie,\" he said finally, looking at her\ncuriously and wondering just what he was going to say.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.<|begin_of_text|>John journeyed to the office.Here again was\nhis chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel\nthat he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They\nhad gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly\nloved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to\nmarry her--could not very well.\"You have this thing wrong,\" he went on slowly.\"I don't know\nwhat comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know\nanything about.But my family has to be\ntaken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the\ndifficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you\nto leave me.I can't prevent you, of\ncourse.But I don't think you ought to want\nto.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,\nwas now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet\nargument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading\nwith her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand.\"There's really nothing to be gained by\nyour leaving me at present.\"Well, how did you expect to get along?\"\"I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone\nnow--and get something to do, maybe.\"\"Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have\ndone?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?<|begin_of_text|>Sandra dropped the apple.\"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper,\" she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most\npromising idea that had occurred to her.\"No, no,\" he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you\nwon't be any better off morally than you are right now.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and\nI don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though\nwith my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping\nback into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some\nprovision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,\nJennie?\"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's\nown conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his\nhand was enough to upset her.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra got the apple there.\"Don't cry, Jennie,\" he said.\"This thing may work out better than\nyou think.You're not\ngoing to leave me any more, are you?\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary journeyed to the bathroom.\"Let things rest as they are,\" he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily\nwouldn't stand for.\"He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly\nthrough her tears.\"Now you put those things away,\" he said genially, pointing to the\ntrunks.\"Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.\"\"No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking\nthings out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about\nit.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any\nconcealment between us.\"\"I know, Lester,\" she said earnestly, looking him straight in the\neyes.\"I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I\nwon't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now.\"That sounds like what you ought to be,\" he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future\nof Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him\nfor several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to\ntalk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner\nwhat had happened in Cleveland.\"I know he is very unhappy there all\nalone,\" she said, \"and I hate to think of it.<|begin_of_text|>Sandra went back to the garden.I was going to get him\nif I went back to Cleveland.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel picked up the football there.Now I don't know what to do about\nit.\"\"He won't take any more money from me, Lester,\" she explained.\"He\nthinks I'm not good--not acting right.\"He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?\"\"I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.\"What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?\"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross,\" she said\nsimply.\"I hardly know what to suggest in that case,\" smiled Lester.\"The\nold gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.\"<|begin_of_text|>Mary went to the kitchen.\"I know,\" she said, \"but he's old now, and he has had so much\ntrouble.\"Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork.\"I'll tell you\nwhat I've been thinking, Jennie,\" he said finally.<|begin_of_text|>Daniel travelled to the kitchen.\"There's no use\nliving this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been\nthinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.", "question": "Where is the football?
