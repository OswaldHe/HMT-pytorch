We show and quantify, as a function of particle inertia, the correlation between the multiscale structures of turbulence and particle collisions: Straining zones contribute predominantly to rapid head-on collisions compared to vortical regions. We also discover the importance of vortex-strain worm-rolls, which goes beyond ideas of preferential concentration and may explain the rapid growth of aggregates in natural processes, such as the initiation of rain in warm clouds.\\'\\nauthor:\\n- \\'Jason R.

The most intense structures typically occur near each other, in the form of vortex tubes surrounded by straining sheets, as shown in Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:Qstruc\\\\]. This organization—a sort of vortex-strain *worm-rolls*—is characteristic of turbulent flows\\xa0[@Zeff2003; @Ray2009; @Schumacher2010; @Gotzfried2017], and its origin and dynamical implications continue to be investigated [@Guala2007; @Hamlington2008; @Ray2015; @Wilczek2015; @Lawson2015; @Ray2018]. These structures distinguish fully developed turbulence from purely random flow fields, and must play an important role in many aspects of turbulent transport. The most important of these—because it remains central to our understanding of phenomena as diverse as the formation of planets in circumstellar disks [@Lissauer2013] or the initiation of rain in warm clouds [@Grabowski2013; @Chen2018]—is the growth of macroscopic aggregates, due to collisions and coalescences, from nuclei-particles (dust or aerosols) suspended in a turbulent flow. The role of the underlying turbulent carrier flow is critical: Estimates of, e.g., the rate of growth of these aggregates in the absence of such flows do not agree with that seen in nature\\xa0[@Pumir2016]. Indeed, the explanation of such rapid growth through coalescence, demonstrated [@sundaram1997; @Bec2016; @Onishi2015] and quantified in terms of flow statistics [@vobkuhle2014; @Pumir2016; @Ireland2016], is rooted in the ability of turbulent flows to enhance the rate of collisions between nuclei seed-particles.\\n\\nA critical discovery, due to Bec, *et al.*\\xa0[@Bec2016], was to find the precise connection between the intermittent (multiscaling) nature of the carrier turbulent flow and the accelerated growth of aggregates. And yet the implied correlation between the structure of the flow and droplet collisions-coalescences remains unknown. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that flow structures matter. But the question is how and when?\\n\\nIn this paper we answer this question comprehensively, based on detailed state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNSs), and show how straining regions are intrinsically more effective at generating collisions than vortical ones even for uniformly distributed *inertia-less* particles. Particle inertia widens this discrepancy, not simply by preferential concentration, but also by selectively increasing the collision velocities in straining zones. This is because straining regions have a larger proportion of *head-on* or *rear-end* collisions, as opposed to *side-on* collisions, which are predominant in vortical regions. Consequently, a larger fraction of the velocity gradient in straining zones is translated into the particle approach velocity. Finally, and most strikingly, we show how intense vorticity and strain, cohabiting as vortex-strain *worm-rolls*, conspire to generate rapid, violent collisions.\\n\\n![A representative snapshot of three-dimensional contours of ${\\\\mathcal Q}$ showing intense vortex tubes (opaque red: $+5.6 \\\\sqrt{\\\\langle {\\\\mathcal Q^2}\\\\rangle}$) enveloped by dissipative, straining sheets (transparent blue: $-2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\langle {\\\\mathcal Q^2}\\\\rangle}$).[]{data-label=\"fig:Qstruc\"}](Qstruc2.pdf){width=\".8\\\\columnwidth\"}\\n\\nWe therefore consider a turbulent flow whose velocity $\\\\bm u$ (subject to the incompressibility constraint $\\\\nabla\\\\cdot {\\\\bm u} = 0$) is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation $$\\\\partial_t {\\\\bm u} + ({\\\\bm u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla){\\\\bm u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 {\\\\bm u} + {\\\\bm f}$$ where $\\\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We perform DNSs on a tri-periodic domain with $N{^3}=512^3$ grid points, by using a standard de-aliased pseudo-spectral solver\\xa0[@Canuto1_2006] and a second-order Adams-Bashford scheme for time integration. A statistically stationary, homogeneous and isotropic flow is maintained by the time-dependent large-scale forcing $\\\\bm f$, which injects a constant amount of energy into the first two wavenumber shells. This forcing scheme enables us to control the time-averaged energy dissipation $\\\\epsilon$, which is chosen such that the the Kolmogorov length $\\\\eta = (\\\\nu^3/\\\\epsilon)^{1/4}$ satisfies $\\\\eta k_{\\\\rm\\nmax} \\\\approx 1.7$ (where $k_{\\\\rm max} = \\\\sqrt{2}N/3$ is the maximum resolved wavenumber). The Taylor-Reynolds number (${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{Re}}}_\\\\lambda = 2E\\\\sqrt{5/(3 \\\\nu\\n\\\\epsilon)}$, where $E$ is the total kinetic energy) of the flow is 196.\\n\\nTo identify vortical and straining structures in the flow, we use the ${\\\\mathcal Q}$ criterion\\xa0[@Dubief2000; @Blackburn1996; @Chong1990] through the velocity gradient tensor ${\\\\mathcal{A}}  = \\\\tau_{\\\\eta}\\n\\\\nabla {\\\\bm u}$ (normalized by the Kolmogorov time $\\\\tau_\\\\eta=(\\\\nu/\\\\epsilon)^{1/2}$) which yields the symmetric strain rate tensor ${\\\\mathcal S} = ({\\\\mathcal{A}}\\n+{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{\\\\mathrm T})/2$ and the anti-symmetric rotation rate tensor ${\\\\mathcal R} = ({\\\\mathcal{A}} -{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{\\\\mathrm T})/2$. To compare the relative magnitudes of strain and rotation, we define $S^2 = {\\\\mathcal S}_{ij}\\n{\\\\mathcal S}_{ij}$ and $R^2 = {\\\\mathcal R}_{ij} {\\\\mathcal R}_{ij}$, the difference of which is related to the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor: ${\\\\mathcal Q} = (R^2 - S^2)/2$. Regions where ${\\\\mathcal Q} < 0$ are dominated by irrotational strain, while regions where ${\\\\mathcal Q} > 0$ are vortical. Near-zero values of ${\\\\mathcal Q}$ may correspond to zones with weak velocity gradients, or to strong shear layers where ${R^2 \\\\approx S^2}$ [@Ireland2016]. Figure \\\\[fig:Qstruc\\\\] presents contours of large positive and negative values of ${\\\\mathcal Q}$, which reveal characteristic vortex-strain worm-rolls.\\n\\nWe introduce in the flow $10^6$ identical particles, each having a sub-Kolmogorov radius $a = \\\\eta/3 $ (we have checked that the results reported here are consistent for smaller radii as well, up to $\\\\eta/10$) and a density $\\\\rho_p$ much larger than that of the carrier-fluid $\\\\rho_f$. The particles occupy a small volume fraction of ${\\\\mathcal O} (10^{-4})$ and their influence on the flow is negligible. Since the Reynolds number associated with their slip velocities is small, the evolution of particle trajectories $\\\\bm{X}_{p}(t)$ is determined by the simplified Maxey-Riley equations\\xa0[@CroorRev2017]: $$\\\\frac{d \\\\bm{X}_{p}}{dt}=\\\\bm{V}_{p}, \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{d \\\\bm{V}_{p}}{dt}=-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_{p}} [\\\\bm{V}_{p}-{\\\\bm u}(\\\\bm{X}_{p},t) ] \\\\label{eq:maxey}$$ where $\\\\tau_p = 2 a^2 \\\\rho_{p} /(9 \\\\nu \\\\rho_{f})$, the particle relaxation time, yields the Stokes number (${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}=\\\\tau_p /\\n\\\\tau_\\\\eta)$, which provides a non-dimensional measure of the particle’s inertia. We consider several families of particles, with ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}$ ranging from 0 to 16.75. For non-zero ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}$, Eqs.\\xa0 are solved by using an exponential integration scheme [@Ireland2013]. The case of tracers ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}=\\n0$ is handled separately, by directly setting ${\\\\bm v}_{\\\\rm p}(t) = {\\\\bm\\nu}({\\\\bm X}_{\\\\rm p}(t),t)$ and by using a second order Runge-Kutta time-stepper. The fluid velocity at the particle position is obtained via fourth-order B-spline interpolation [@Hinsberg2012].\\n\\nAfter the randomly-seeded particles have settled into a statistically stationary distribution, we begin detecting collisions using an algorithm similar to that in Ref.\\xa0[@sundaram1997]. We use the standard *ghost collisions* approximation— ignoring coalescence and other post-collision outcomes—to focus on the role of flow structures in bringing particles together and enhancing collision rates.\\n\\n![Bi-probability distribution functions $P(R^2,S^2)$ for inertia-less (tracer) particles, corresponding to the values of $R^2$ and $S^2$ sampled by (a) particles and (b) collision locations, which show the disproportionate bias towards collisions in strain-dominated regions. []{data-label=\"fig:RS\"}](RS_St0.pdf){width=\"1.0\\\\columnwidth\"}\\n\\n![image](AngM_St0.pdf){width=\".8\\\\textwidth\"}\\n\\nThe rate of collisions depends, of course, on the relative velocity of particles at contact\\xa0[@Bhatnagar2018; @Saw2014; @James17]. For tracers (${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}= 0$) or nearly-tracer particles (${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}\\\\gtrsim 0$), this is determined by fluid velocity gradients ($\\\\propto \\\\tau_\\\\eta^{-1}$), which increase in magnitude as the flow becomes more turbulent. This picture, underlying the seminal work of Saffman and Turner\\xa0[@saffman1956], is blind to flow structures: It disregards whether the local velocity gradient arises from rotation or strain.\\n\\nInertial particles (${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}> 0$), e.g., droplets in air, do not respond instantaneously to changes in the flow. Such particles *preferentially concentrate*, thereby increasing their local number density\\xa0[@sundaram1997]. They can also attain relative velocities much larger than that of the underlying flow. Dubbed the *sling effect* [@Falkovich2002], these events correspond to the formation of singularities or *caustics* in the particle velocity field [@Wilkinson2006; @Croor2015]. Although clustering and caustics have been tied to the centrifugal ejection of heavy particles out of vortices, they also occur in smooth random flows that are devoid of structure [@Bec2005; @Wilkinson2007; @sticky; @Gustavsson2013; @Gustavsson2014]. Consequently, the presence of these effects does not necessarily imply that collisions sense the structures of turbulence.\\n\\nTo unambiguously determine the influence of the local flow field, we must begin with tracers which remain uniformly distributed in space. To allow for collisions, the radii of these particles are kept (artificially) finite, while their inertia is ignored. According to the Saffman-Turner theory\\xa0[@saffman1956], collisions should occur uniformly between any two regions that possess the same velocity gradient magnitude, regardless of whether these regions are vortical or straining. We now examine this hypothesis, bearing in mind that a discrepancy will implicate flow structures that are intrinsically more effective at causing collisions.\\n\\nTowards this end, we calculate the values of $R^2$ and $S^2$ along particle trajectories, as well as at collision locations. The results for inertia-less particles are presented as joint probability distributions functions $P(R^2,S^2)$ in Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:RS\\\\]a and Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:RS\\\\]b, respectively. It is immediately clear that collisions under-sample vortical regions ($R^2 > S^2$) and over-sample straining regions ($S^2 > R^2$), relative to where particles reside. This is also seen in Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:Ang\\\\]a, which overlays contours of $P(R^2,S^2) = 0.1$ and 0.02, for particles (dashed) and collisions (solid). The strain (vorticity) dominated portion of this plot is shaded in blue (red), and corresponds to ${\\\\mathcal Q}\\n< -0.3$ (${\\\\mathcal Q} > +0.3$).\\n\\nThis surprising result is an outcome of the distinct flow topologies of these regions which cause particles to approach each other differently. Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:Ang\\\\]b presents the distribution of the cosine of the collision angle ($\\\\theta$), for straining (blue) and vortical (red) regions. $\\\\theta$ is defined as the angle between the relative velocity vector ($V_{p1} - V_{p2}$) and the separation vector ($X_{p1} - X_{p2}$) at collision. Particles in straining regions tend to collide in a head-on or rear-end manner ($\\\\theta\\n\\\\approx 0$ or $\\\\pi$). In either case, a large fraction of the velocity difference between particles contributes to their rate of approach or collision velocity ($\\\\Delta v_{||}$). On the other hand, particles in vortices undergo collisions that are closer to being side-on, in which case the separation vector is nearly perpendicular to the relative velocity. This results in lower approach velocities in vortical regions, as shown in Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:Ang\\\\]c. Consequently, over a given time interval, fewer particles will collide in vortical regions compared to straining regions with the same magnitude of the velocity gradient and particle number density.\\n\\n![image](Q_d_vr_St.pdf){width=\".95\\\\textwidth\"}\\n\\nHow does particle inertia affect this picture? Figure\\xa0\\\\[fig:den\\\\_vr\\\\]a presents the average value of $\\\\mathcal Q$ sampled by particles (dashed-red) and their collision locations (solid-black) as a function of ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}$. At ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}= 0$, $\\\\langle\\n{\\\\mathcal Q} \\\\rangle$ is 0 for particles and -0.04 for collisions. Remarkably, this offset is strongly amplified by inertia and reaches a maximum around ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}\\\\approx 0.3$, beyond which particles begin to de-correlate from the underlying flow and eventually collide uniformly. The preference of *inertial* particles (${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}> 0$) to collide in straining regions has been reported previously by Perrin and Jonker [@Perrin2014; @Perrin2016]. Our results demonstrate that this effect is not fundamentally tied to particle inertia, but rather is an amplification of a difference that exists even for inertia-less tracers, raising the question: how does particle inertia selectively enhance collisions in straining regions?\\n\\nOne possible explanation is provided by preferential concentration: Heavy particles are centrifuged out of rotational regions, and thus tend to accumulate in straining zones just outside vortices\\xa0[@Croor2015]. This causes the number density to increase in straining regions, at the expense of vortical zones, as shown in Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:den\\\\_vr\\\\]b. Here, $n$ is a coarse-grained number density, obtained by dividing the domain into bins of size $20 \\\\eta$. The average $\\\\mathcal Q$ in each bin is used to distinguish between vortical ($\\\\mathcal Q > 0$) and straining regions ($\\\\mathcal Q < 0$) and obtain the conditionally averaged number density. All else being equal, higher number densities imply larger collision rates [@Pumir2016]. However, we see that the maximum difference in number densities occurs near ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}\\\\approx 1$, which is *not* where the maximum difference in $\\\\langle\\n{\\\\mathcal Q} \\\\rangle$ is seen (Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:den\\\\_vr\\\\]a). Hence another mechanism must be involved.\\n\\nInertia is also known to increase the relative velocity between neighboring particles [@Saw2014; @James17], which should result in higher collision velocities. On examining this effect in straining and vortical regions separately, we find that it is stronger in straining regions and, in fact, has no impact on vortical regions for small ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}$. This is demonstrated in Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:den\\\\_vr\\\\]c, which presents the average values of $\\\\Delta v_{||}$, conditioned on $ {\\\\mathcal Q}$. It appears that head-on (or rear-end) collisions, which prevail in straining zones, are more amenable to being sped-up by inertia than side-on collisions. Notably, the maximum difference between collision velocities occurs near ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}\\\\approx 0.3$, which matches well with the maximum difference in $\\\\langle {\\\\mathcal Q} \\\\rangle$ (Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:den\\\\_vr\\\\]a). Thus, larger approach rates, rather than number densities, appear to be the primary reason for the effectiveness of straining regions in creating collisions.\\n\\n![image](lag_avg.pdf){width=\".91\\\\textwidth\"}\\n\\nThus far, we have considered vortical and straining regions individually. Particle inertia, however, permits structures within a distance of $\\\\tau_p V_p$ to influence a collision. This raises the possibility of vortical and straining regions conspiring to enhance collisions, especially for moderately large ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}$. For example, the geometry of vortex-strain *worm-rolls* (Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:Qstruc\\\\]) will cause particles in intense vortex tubes to be rapidly ejected into strong straining sheets, where they are very likely to collide.\\n\\nWe search for evidence of this effect by tracing, backward in time, all particles that collide in straining regions. For the subset that do have atleast one particle originating from a vortex, we record (i) the time taken to collide after leaving the vortex and entering the straining zone ($t_{strain}$), as indicated by $\\\\mathcal Q$ changing sign; (ii) the strength of the vortex, measured in terms of the maximum positive value of $\\\\mathcal Q$ sampled inside the vortex ($\\\\mathcal Q_{vortex}$); (iii) the intensity of straining at the collision location ($\\\\mathcal Q_{col}$); and (iv) the collision velocity. While measuring the vortex strength, we only back-track for a time of $3 \\\\tau_{\\\\eta}$ within the vortex, to ensure that the $\\\\mathcal Q$ values obtained are relevant to the subsequent collision. The conclusions are insensitive to the exact value of this threshold.\\n\\nFig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:lag\\\\] presents the results of this Lagrangian calculation, conditionally averaged on $t_{strain}$, for ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}= 1, 0.6$ and $0.1$. The data for moderately large ${\\\\mbox{\\\\textit{St}}}$ (1 and 0.6), reveal the impact of vortex-strain worm-rolls. Particles that collide quickly (small $t_{strain}$), are found to originate from more intense vortices (Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:lag\\\\]a) and to collide in stronger straining regions (Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:lag\\\\]b). This signature weakens considerably for less inertial ($St = 0.1$) particles which are mildly ejected and relax faster to the local straining flow.\\n\\nThe collision velocities for small $t_{strain}$ are also systematically larger (Fig.\\xa0\\\\[fig:lag\\\\]c). The standard deviation about each data point (not shown for clarity) is of the order of the average value. Thus, several small $t_{strain}$ collisions have very large collision velocities, indicative of caustics/sling events, which are known to dominate the collision rate for $St >\\n0.5$ [@vobkuhle2014; @Pumir2016]. Traditionally, these have been linked to rapid ejection from vortices [@Falkovich2002]. Our results indicate that this is only half the story: Straining sheets which envelope strong vortices also contribute to generating violent collisions and enhancing collision rates.\\n\\nAn appreciation for flow structures naturally leads one to ask how collisions are affected when structures change. The influence of $Re_\\\\lambda$ is particularly important to consider, as the estimated values for natural flows are orders of magnitude larger than what can be attained in simulations [@Grabowski2013; @Lissauer2013]. Increasing $Re_\\\\lambda$ results in higher intermittency, which translates into more intense structures (see, e.g., Ref.\\xa0[@burgersvortex] for a similar study of a model stretched-vortex), but which occupy smaller volumes. These competing effects are known to produce a non-monotonic variation of particle clustering [@Onishi2014]. Regarding collisions, our initial calculations show that differences between vortical and straining regions increase from $Re_\\\\lambda=69$ to $196$; it remains to be seen in a systematic way how this phenomenon is affected in a higher Reynolds number flow.\\n\\nFlow structures can also be significantly modified by new physical interactions, for example, condensation of water vapour on cloud droplets, which releases latent heat and energizes small scales [@Croor2017], and elastic feedback from polymers that suppresses small-scale motions [@Liberzon2006; @Prasad2010]. Studying collisions in these complex flows is an interesting avenue for future work.\\n\\nBefore we conclude, it is essential to place our work in the context of turbulent transport problems—a canonical example being that of rain-initiation in warm clouds—which have application across the areas of non-equilibrium statistical physics, geophysics, oceanography, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences. Understanding these problems demands not only an appreciation of how fast droplets sediment, collide and coalesce (in which tremendous advances have been made in recent years) but also knowledge of *where* such processes are most likely to occur. This paper, therefore, contributes to a fuller understanding of this question.\\n\\nWe thank Jérémie Bec, S.

I won’t pretend to have\\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\\nremarkable conveniences.\\n\\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\\n\\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\\nmy little French library.\\n\\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\\nhumbug.”\\n\\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\\n\\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\\ngentleman?”\\n\\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\\n\\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\\nbe a great rascal!”\\n\\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\\nrave about me.”\\n\\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\\n\\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\\n\\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\\nthey pick him up?”\\n\\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\\n\\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\\n\\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\\n\\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\\ndon’t disappoint me.”\\n\\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\\n\\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\\nto take him.”\\n\\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\\nleast liked.\\n\\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\\n\\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\\n\\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\\n\\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\\n\\n“And what’s it all about?”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\\n\\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\\nexception.\\n\\n“None whatever?”\\n\\n“None whatever.”\\n\\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\\nthem.\\n\\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\\nwere—who had always done most for her.\\n\\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\\nherself says he is.”\\n\\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\\n\\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\\n\\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\\n\\n“The humiliation?”\\n\\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\\npurchaser of a ticket.”\\n\\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\\n\\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\\n\\n“How then do you get at it?”\\n\\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\\n\\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\\n\\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\\ngreat eyes.”\\n\\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\\nreally done it all.\\n\\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\\n\\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\\n\\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\\n\\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\\n\\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\\nbecause I know him well.”\\n\\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\\n\\n“Awful—quite awful.”\\n\\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\\n\\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\\n\\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\\ncause of his vices?”\\n\\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\\n\\n“A want of will?”\\n\\n“A want of dignity.”\\n\\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\\n\\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\\n\\n“And how much do they come to?”\\n\\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\\ndefence.”\\n\\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\\n\\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\\ntalk.”\\n\\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\\n\\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\\n\\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\\n\\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\\n\\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\\n\\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\\n\\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\\n\\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\\n\\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\\n\\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\\n\\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\\n\\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\\nreached.\\n\\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\\nme off here altogether.\\n\\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\\nMiss Anvoy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\\nother springs!”\\n\\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\\n\\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\\n\\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\\n\\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\\n\\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\\n\\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\\n\\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\\n\\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\\n\\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\\n\\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\\n\\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\\n\\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\\n\\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\\nwith her fostering smile.\\n\\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\\n\\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\\ncourse announced?”\\n\\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\\nabout Saltram’s call.\\n\\n“And how did you find him?”\\n\\n“Oh so strange!”\\n\\n“You didn’t like him?”\\n\\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\\n\\n“You want to do that?”\\n\\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\\n\\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\\n\\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\\n\\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\\n\\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\\ntendency to make one cross.\\n\\n“What help do you mean?”\\n\\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\\n\\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\\n\\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\\nless than a week’s notice.\\n\\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\\n\\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\\n\\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\\n\\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\\n\\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\\nwish.”\\n\\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\\n\\n“Well, since you ask me!”\\n\\n“Right there on the spot?”\\n\\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\\n\\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\\nmoney?”\\n\\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\\n\\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\\n\\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\\nhours.”\\n\\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\\nbetrothed!”\\n\\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\\nimpulse.”\\n\\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\\n\\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\\n\\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\\n\\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\\nknow how little he calculates?”\\n\\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\\n\\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\\nlistening face.”\\n\\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\\n\\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\\n\\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\\n\\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\\n\\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\\n\\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\\n\\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\\n\\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\\n\\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\\n\\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\\n\\n“I mean yours.”\\n\\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\\n\\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\\n\\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\\n\\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\\nhands.\\n\\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\\n\\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\\n\\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\\n\\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\\n\\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\\n\\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\\nfrankly.\\n\\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\\nactive person of some use.\\n\\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\\ndifferent ways.”\\n\\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\\nAnvoy.”\\n\\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\\n\\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\\n\\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\\n\\n“She wishes to endow—?”\\n\\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\\n\\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\\n\\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\\n\\n“His search for what?”\\n\\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\\n\\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\\ncharming idea.”\\n\\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\\n\\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\\n\\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\\ntalk.”\\n\\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\\ndisagreement.”\\n\\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\\n\\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\\n\\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\\n\\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\\n\\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\\n\\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\\n\\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\\nto a link with the ideal.”\\n\\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\\n\\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\\nno mistake.”\\n\\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\\n\\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\\nit.”\\n\\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\\n\\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\\n\\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\\n\\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\\nher proposal.”\\n\\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\\n\\n“Except as a formal trust.”\\n\\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\\n\\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\\nscheme.”\\n\\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\\n\\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\\n\\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\\n\\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\\nof an extravagant woman?”\\n\\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\\n\\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\\n\\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\\n\\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\\n\\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\\nuse of this last word to question her further.\\n\\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\\n\\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\\n\\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\\nbeing impressed?”\\n\\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\\n\\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\\nfor Miss Anvoy.\\n\\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\\n\\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\\nuntoward events.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\\nshe staying in England for?”\\n\\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\\n\\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\\n\\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\\n\\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\\n\\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\\n\\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\\n\\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\\n\\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\\nSaltram.”\\n\\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\\npale.  “How very awful!”\\n\\n“Awful?”\\n\\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\\n\\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\\n\\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\\nto admire.\\n\\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\\n\\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\\n\\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\\n\\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\\n\\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\\n\\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\\n\\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\\nlegal aspect.”\\n\\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\\nobligation.”\\n\\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\\n\\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\\n\\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\\n\\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\\n\\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\\n\\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\\n\\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\\n\\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\\n\\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\\n\\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\\n\\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\\n\\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\\n\\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\\n\\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\\nbigger every day.”\\n\\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\\n\\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\\n\\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\\n\\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\\nhas reached.”\\n\\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\\n\\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\\n\\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\\n\\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\\nwas sublime.\\n\\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\\ncorrespondence with them.\\n\\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\\n\\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\\nthey write to me?”\\n\\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\\nadded.\\n\\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\\npresently declared.\\n\\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\\n\\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\\n\\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\\n\\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\\ndirectly?”\\n\\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\\nMulville.”\\n\\n“And why should that prevent?”\\n\\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\\n\\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\\ndemanded.\\n\\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\\nown idea.”\\n\\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\\n\\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\\n\\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\\n\\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\\n\\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\\n\\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\\n\\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\\n\\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\\n\\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\\nkindness before her reverses.”\\n\\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\\nMulvilles!”\\n\\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\\n\\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\n\\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\\n\\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\\nI was discouraging.”\\n\\n“Discouraging?”\\n\\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\\n\\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\\n\\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\\n\\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\\n\\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\\n\\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\\n\\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\\nin ignorance of it.”\\n\\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\\n\\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\\n\\n“And you don’t mean to?”\\n\\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\\n\\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\\n\\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\\n\\n“Why is it sent through you?”\\n\\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\\n\\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\\nstammered.\\n\\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\\n\\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\\nfriends.”\\n\\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\\n\\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\\n\\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\\n\\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\\n\\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\\n\\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\\n\\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\\n\\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\\n\\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\\n\\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\\n\\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\\n\\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\\nit.”\\n\\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\\nFund must be rolling up?', 'answers': ['He is a guest in the home of the Mulvilles.'], 'length': 22692, 'dataset': 'narrativeqa', 'language': 'en', 'all_classes': None, '_id': '341d214a2c377691bf20e5a30b8f7979696bd19141ad9c9f'}\n",

Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station\\'s theme song is \"Everybody Knows\" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show.\\nNobody knows the true identity of \"Hard Harry\" or \"Happy Harry Hard-on,\" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicideâ\\x80\\x94at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.\\nEventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school\\'s principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling \"problem students,\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district\\'s test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding.\\nRealizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother\\'s old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can\\'t be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \"talk hard.\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.', 'tokens': ['Mark', 'Hunter', '(', 'Slater', ')', ',', 'a', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'in', 'a', 'sleepy', 'suburb', 'of', 'Phoenix', ',',

Hiss name is Happy Harry Hardon. \\nHe\\'s a total sex maniac.\\n\\nJanie - Off course.\\n\\nNora - He comes on every night at ten o\\'clock.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Okay, down to business. I got my wild cherry diet Pepsi and I got \\nmy Black Jack gum here and I got that feeling, mmm that familiar feeling that something \\nrank is going down up there. Yeah, I can smell it. I can almost taste it. The rankness in \\nthe air. It\\'s everywhere. It\\'s running through that old pipeline out there, trickling along the \\ndumb concrete river and coming up the drains of those lovely tracktones we all live in. I \\nmean I don\\'t know. Everywhere I look it seems everything is sold out.\\n\\nAnnie - They say this is where the reception is the coolest.\\n\\nJohnathan - Then he\\'ll probably live right around here.\\n\\nMazz - Fucking Yuppies.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - My dad sold out. And my mom sold out years ago when she had \\nme. And then they sold me out when they brought me to this hole in the world. They \\nmade me everything I am today so naturally I hate the bastards.

I just arrived in this stupid \\nsuburb. I have no friends, no money, no car, no licence. And even if I did have a licence \\nall I can do is drive out to some stupid mall. Maybe if I\\'m lucky play some fucking video \\ngames, smoke a joint and get stupid. You see, there\\'s nothing to do anymore. Everything \\ndecents been done. All the great themes have been used up. Turned into theme parks. So I \\ndon\\'t really find it cheerful to be living in totally exhausted decade where there is nothing \\nto look forward to and no one to look up to. That was deep. Oh no, not again. The \\ncreature stirs. Oh God, I think it is going to be a gusher. This is the sixth time in an hour. \\nOh god...\\n\\nAnnie - He sounds like he chronically masturbated.\\n\\nJohnathan - He prides himself on it.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - You see, I take care of it.

That\\'s my man.\\n\\nMarla Hunter - God, I feel so out of touch here.\\n\\nBrian Hunter - We didn\\'t move out here to stay in touch.\\n\\nMarla Hunter - And why did we move out here?\\n\\nBrian Hunter - Oh, because it\\'s a nice place to live. I\\'m making good money and I\\'m the\\nyoungest school commissioner in the History of Arizona.\\n\\nMarla Hunter - Brian, you know what. The man I married loved his work. Not power and\\nmoney.\\n\\nBrian Hunter - That\\'s all right I still love my work. And I love power and money.\\n\\nMarla Hunter - Young radical Brain, you were always fighting against the system. And \\nnow you are...\\n\\nBrian Hunter - I am the system, yeah. Is that a beer?\\n\\nMark Hunter (Happy Harry Hardon) - Sure!\\n\\nMarla Hunter - Have you notice his behaviour lately?\\n\\nBrian Hunter - What about him?\\n\\nMarla Hunter - He\\'s just so unhappy here.\\n\\nBrian Hunter - I\\'ll go talk to him.\\n\\n<Brian\\'s Study>\\n\\nBrian Hunter - Hi, what\\'s up?\\n\\nMark - I was just looking for some stamps.\\n\\nBrian Hunter - Oh fine, I got some right here.

Surely some of \\nthem\\nhave gotta be cool.\\n\\nMark - Look the deal is I get decent grades and you guys leave me alone.\\n\\n<Back at Hupert Humphrey>\\n\\nJanie - Okay so who is this guy?\\n\\nNora - I don\\'t know, nobody knows who he is, but he really hates this school so I guess \\nhe goes here.\\n\\nJanie - But all the guys that go here are geeks.\\n\\nNora - Maybe not my dear! Later\\n\\nJanie - Later?\\n\\n<English Class>\\n\\nJan Emerson - And so then the logi cars questioned the few remaining death spurs more \\nand more they began to fade away until there was nothing left of them and they \\ndisappeared from the face of the earth.......... Hmm, pretty good hey? Leading with your \\nheart, not your mind. I wondered if you would tell us what you were thinking when you \\nwrote this?\\n\\nMark - I just wrote it late last night.\\n\\nJan - That\\'s obvious it\\'s practically a night book. Mark, I was hoping you\\'d share your \\nfeelings about it. <Bell rings> Saved by the bell. Don\\'t think If I didn\\'t read your \\ncomposition it won\\'t be read. Mark! We\\'re looking for new writers for The Clarion. Don\\'t \\nbe embarrassed of your talent.\\n\\n<Murdock\\'s woodwork class. A Happy Harry Hardon Tape blasting out of a stereo>\\n\\nClass - Morning Mr. Murdock\\n\\nMurdock - I\\'m not stupid you know.\\n\\n<Staff room>\\n\\nCreswood - This school is judged on one category only: Academic scores. The lesson of \\nmodern education is that nothing comes easily, no pain, no gain.\\n\\nMurdock <enters> - Excuse me everyone do you want to listen to this, it\\'s the third this \\nweek. It\\'s unbelievable.\\n\\n<Murdock plays a tape with Happy Harry Hardon simulating masturbation>\\n\\nJan - <laughs>\\n\\nCreswood - Jan! This is no laughing matter.\\n\\n<School Library>\\n\\nNora - Hi!\\n\\nMark - Hi\\n\\nNora - You\\'re in my writing class right.\\n\\nMark - Right.\\n\\nNora - Yeah I like Emerson (Jan) she\\'s pretty funky. <Nora look at the date on Marks \\nbook> Now you\\'re in trouble!.... You owe me twenty five cents...... \"How To Talk Dirty \\nAnd Influence People\" by Lenny Bruce. Who\\'s he?... Any good?\\n\\nMark - He\\'s alright.\\n\\nNora - Talk a lot.\\n\\nMark - Not to much no.\\n\\n<Mark leaves and Nora looks down at checklist of possible Hard Harrys\\'>\\n\\nNora - Cute, but no way!\\n\\n<A ten o\\'clock show>  \\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Guess who? It\\'s ten o\\'clock do you care where your parents are? \\nAfter all it\\'s a jungle out there. <Everybody Knows plays> I don\\'t know. Everywhere I \\nlook it seems that someone\\'s getting butt surfed by the system. Parents are always talking \\nabout the system, and the sixties and how cool it was. Well look at where the sixties got \\nthem hey! Come on people now smile on your brother everybody together try and love \\none another right now!!! Now that was the sixties, this is a song from the nineties from \\nmy buddies the Descendants. <The Descendants play> I hate the sixties, I hate school, I \\nhate principals, I hate vice principles!! But my true pure refined hatred is reserved for \\nguidance councillors. Happy Harry just happens to have in his very hands a copy of a \\nmemo written by Mr. David Deaver, guidance councillor extrordinaire to one Miss \\nLoretta Creswood, high school principle. \"I found Cheryl un-remorseful about her current \\ncondition\" Bastard can\\'t even say she\\'s knocked up. \"And she\\'s unwilling to minimise it\\'s \\naffect on the morals of the student population.\" Guidance councillors!!!!! If they knew \\nanything about career moves would they have ended up as guidance councillors? What \\ndo you say we call Deaver up hey? Happy Harry Hardon just happens to have the home \\nphone numbers of every employee up at Paradise Hills. Here we go, there you are Mr. \\nDeesky <Happy Harry Hardon rings up Mr Deaver>.\\n\\nDeaver - Deaver residence, David Deaver speaking.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hey this is WKPS, we\\'re doing a piece on high schools. We \\nunderstand that your a guidance councillor.\\n\\nDeaver - I\\'m head of guidance at Hubert Humphrey High in Paradise Hills Arizona. I\\'ve \\nbeen there seven years.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Can you tell me a bit about what you do.\\n\\nDeaver - I run a comprehensive American values program, erm in which we discuss \\nethical situations, sex education and drug abuse.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - What do you say to young people who look around at the world \\nand see it\\'s become, like you know, a sleazy country, a place you just can\\'t trust. Like \\nyour school for example. Why is it, it wins all of these awards and students are dropping \\nout like flies, why..why is that. Now my listeners are interested in the decision to expel \\nCheryl Bates.\\n\\nDeaver - I, erm, I\\'m not aware of anything like that, I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking \\nabout.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - That is not true sir. \"Cheryl refuses to accept suggestions of a \\nmore positive mental attitude towards her health and her future. I\\'m afraid I find no \\nalternative, but to suggest suspension.\"\\n\\nDeaver - Who is this? How did you get this number?\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Are you going to admit it sir.\\n\\nDeaver - Admit what?\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - That you\\'re slime!\\n\\nDeaver - Now just wait a minute.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - You interview a student and then you rat on her, you betray her \\ntrust, isn\\'t that right Sir!<Deaver hangs up> Well as you can see, these guys are played \\nout. Society is mutating so rapidly that anyone over the age of twenty has really no \\nidea.... Err alright, back down to business. \"I share a room with my older brother and \\nnearly every night after he turns off his light he come over to my bed and gives me a few \\narm nookies and stuff and then makes me scratch his back and other refinements\" It\\'s \\nabout time we had some refinements on this show. \"Then sooner or later he gets worked \\nup and further a do he rubs his thing and makes me watch.\" Signed \"I\\'m just screwed up\" \\nWell first of all you\\'re not screwed up, your an unscrewed up reaction to a screwed up \\nsituation. Feeling screwed up at a screwed up time, in a screwed up place does not make \\nyou necessarily screwed up, if you catch my drift. Well as you know dear listeners if you \\nenclose your number a reply is guaranteed. <Rings Miss Screwed Up>\\n\\nMiss Screwed Up - Hello\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - This is Happy Harry Hardon, your live. Is this Miss Screwed Up.\\n\\nMiss Screwed Up - Yes\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Well I have a couple of questions. How big is it, this thing you \\ndescribed? Is it bigger than a baby\\'s arm..... What you don\\'t remember or you don\\'t want \\nto tell me?.... Or maybe you made this whole thing up hey? Remember my dear I can \\nsmell a lie like a fart in a car. <Miss Screwed Up hangs up> Well it\\'s too bad about that \\none actually, to me the real truth is always a bigger turn on. It doesn\\'t have to be a big \\ndeal, it could be anything.\\n\\n<Malcolm\\'s bedroom>\\n\\nMrs Kaiser - Malcolm have you finished your homework yet?\\n\\nMalcolm - Yes.\\n\\nMrs Kaiser - Your father and I are downstairs, why don\\'t you come and join us for once.\\n\\nMalcolm - No.\\n\\nMrs Kaiser - Okay Malcolm have it your way.\\n\\nMalcolm - Thanks.\\n\\n<Back at Hard Harrys\\'>\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Send me your most pathetic moment, your most anything, as long \\nas it\\'s real. I mean I want the size, the shape, the feel, the smell. I want blood sweat and \\ntears on these letters. I want brains and ectoplasm and cum spilled all over them. \\nHallelujah! And now , all my horny listeners, get one hand free because yes, the eat me \\nbeat me lady is back. \"Come in. Every night you enter me like a criminal. You break into \\nmy brain, but you\\'re no ordinary criminal. You put your feet up, you drink your can of \\nPepsi, you start to party, you turn up my stereo. Songs I\\'ve never heard, but I move \\nanyway. You get me crazy, I say \\'Do it.\\' I don\\'t care just do it. Jam me, jack me, push me, \\npull me -talk hard!\"............ I like that. Talk Hard. I like the idea that a voice can just go \\nsomewhere uninvited and just kind of hang out like a dirty thought in a nice clean mind. \\nTo me a thought is like a virus. You know, it can just kill all the healthy thoughts and just \\ntake over. That would be serious.\\n\\nNora - That would be totally serious.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I know all of my horny listeners would love it if I would call up \\nthe eat me beat me lady. But no! Because she never encloses her number.\\n\\nNora - Tough look creepoid.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Always the same red paper, the same beautiful black writing. \\nShe\\'s probably a lot like me, a legend in her own mind. But you know what, I bet in real \\nlife she\\'s probably not that wild. I bet she\\'s kind of shy like so many of us who briskly \\nwalk the halls, pretending to be late for some class, pretending to be distracted. Hey \\npoetry lady, are you really this cool? Are you out there? Are you listening? \\n\\nNora - I\\'m always out here.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I feel like I know you, and yet we\\'ll never meet. Ah so be it... \\nNow here\\'s a song from my close personal buddies the Beastie Boys. A song that was so \\ncontroversial they couldn\\'t put it on their second album. What about a little night light.\\n\\n<Beastie Boys play>\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I just love being the rap king of Arizona. I don\\'t know drugs are \\nout, sex is out, politics are out, everything is on hold. I mean we definitely need \\nsomething knew. We just keep waiting for some new voice to come out of somewhere \\nand say \"Hey wait a minute, what is wrong with this picture.\" <picks up a letter and \\nopens it> Well maybe this is the answer to everything, wouldn\\'t that be nice hey.  \"Dear \\nHappy Harry Hardon do you think I should kill myself\" Great! Signed \"I\\'m Serious\" And \\nof course there is a number here. <Calls the number> Hello serious?\\n\\nMalcolm - Yeah\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Are you okay?\\n\\nMalcolm - Yep\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I guess what I\\'m asking is how serious are you, well how are you \\ngoing to do it?\\n\\nMalcolm - I\\'m gonna blow my fucking head off.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - O! Well do you have a gun.\\n\\nMalcolm - No I\\'m going to use my finger genius.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Alright. So where is this gonna take place hey?\\n\\nMalcolm - Right here.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Where is this alleged gun? Do you have it with you? Did you at \\nleast write a note? You have a reason don\\'t you? Your not going to be one of those people \\nwho kills themselves and nobody has any idea of why they did it? Hey that\\'s why we \\nneed a note pal!\\n\\nMalcolm - I\\'m all alone.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - No, hey, maybe it\\'s okay to be alone sometimes, everybody\\'s \\nalone.\\n\\nMalcolm - You\\'re not.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I didn\\'t talk to one person today, not..not counting teachers. I sit \\nalone everyday you know, sitting on the stairwell eating my lunch, reading a book. What \\nabout you?  <Malcolm hangs up> I hate that, now I\\'m depressed. Now I feel like killing \\nmyself, but I\\'m too depressed to bother. <Tries to re-dial Malcolm, but it\\'s engaged> \\nGreat! He\\'s got the phone of the hook. Rejected again, that\\'s okay I\\'m use to it, terminal \\nloneliness....... People always think they no who a person is but they\\'re always wrong. \\nMost parents have no idea. It\\'s just that mine had me tested because I sit alone in my \\nroom alone, naked, wearing only a cock ring, heh heh! I mean it really bugs me, everyone \\nknows what a person should be, who cares who I should be! You know, in real life I \\ncould be that anonymous nerd sitting across from you in Chem. Lab, staring at you so \\nhard, you turn around, he tries to smile, but the smile just comes out all wrong. You just \\nthink how pathetic, then he just looks away and never looks back at you again. Well hey, \\nwho cares, that\\'s my motto. Well sleep tight Cheryl, sleep tight Miss Refinements, sleep \\ntight Poetry Lady, sleep tight Mr Serious, maybe you\\'ll feel better tomorrow.\\n\\n<Tomorrow at school>\\n\\nJamie - Hey what\\'s a cock ring, it sounds cool.\\n\\nAlex - How should I know, maybe it\\'s a ring with a cock on it.\\n\\nJamie - But he said he was wearing.\\n\\n<Mark approaches Paige>\\n\\nMark - Hi\\n\\nPaige - Hi.\\n\\n<Someone puts a tape on of Happy Harry Hardon\\'s conversation with Deaver>\\n\\nMurdock - You know people this dancing is a privilege and it will be taken away if it\\'s \\nabused, do you understand that?\\n\\n<Nora searches the school grounds for Mark and finds him reading on the stairs>\\n\\nNora - Hi, got a stick of gum. Black Jack!... You really as horny as a ten peckerd \\nhouse?..... Hi my names Nora, what\\'s yours?\\n\\nMark - Mark.\\n\\nNora - Mark! Well hi Mark.\\n\\nMark - Hi.\\n\\nNora - Listen, I was gonna cut fourth period, do you wanna join me for a smoke in the \\narts clay room.\\n\\nMark - Er, no, I can\\'t, got to go, sorry.\\n\\nNora - Sorry!\\n\\n<Staff room>\\n\\nMurdock - These dam tapes keep cropping up all over the place, they were playing this in \\nthe alcove.\\n\\nMr. Moore - Who is this guy anyway, everyday there\\'s more graffiti.\\n\\nMr. Stern - I don\\'t know, but he\\'s turning the school upside down.\\n\\nJan - Has anybody seen Luis Chavez he wasn\\'t in my class today.\\n\\nMr. Stern - Mine either.\\n\\n<Murdock plays the tape of Happy Harry Hardon reading out Deaver\\'s letter to \\nCreswood. Creswood enters the staff room.>\\n\\nCreswood - Turn that off, I\\'ve got an announcement to make.\\n\\n<Mark\\'s English class>\\n\\nJan - I have some very upsetting news. Last night one of our students, Malcolm Kaiser \\ntook his own life, for those of you who knew him, there will be a memorial service at \\nDempsey hill on Friday. I know it hurts, it\\'s painful to lose someone.\\n\\n<Mark collects his post from the postal centre, exits and starts to read the eat me beat me \\nlady\\'s letter>\\n\\nMark (Reads silently) - \"You\\'re the voice crying out in the wilderness, your the voice that \\nmakes my brain burn and make my guts go gooey. Yeah you gut me, my insides spill on \\nyour alter and tell the future, my steaming gleaming guts spill out your nature. I know \\nyou, not your name, but your game. I know the true you, come to me or I\\'ll come to you.\"\\n\\n<Nora appears from behind the bus stop>\\n\\nNora - So you are him! Don\\'t worry I\\'m not going to bust you or anything... Aren\\'t you \\ngoing to ask who I am?\\n\\nMark - I don\\'t think so, no!\\n\\nNora - I\\'m the eat me beat me lady!   So you don\\'t believe me. \"I know you, not your \\nname, but your game. I know the true you, come to me or I\\'ll come to you.\"  Hey relax, \\nI\\'m not really like that, except when I am.\\n\\nMark - Look it\\'s not your fault. I was listening last night. I didn\\'t think he\\'d go through \\nwith it.\\n\\n<The Hunter dining table>\\n\\nMarla - Mark,  we heard about Malcolm Kaiser, we know.\\n\\nBrian - We were just wondering if you knew him?\\n\\nMark - No not really.\\n\\nBrian - Mark, I\\'m going to ask you something. Your mother and I have been talking and I \\nguess we realise...\\n\\nMarla - Mark, basically we thought you might benefit from seeing a psychiatrist.\\n\\nMark - Is it that obvious.\\n\\nMarla - No honey of course not. We think you\\'re perfect, it\\'s just that you seem so sad \\nand lonely all the time.\\n\\nBrian - And we just want you to feel good about your self.\\n\\nMarla - You had friends in New York Hun.\\n\\nBrian - Have you ever tried to meet people here at all?\\n\\nMarla - Have you ever just walked up to a girl here and said \\'Hi\\'?\\n\\nMark (Trying to make an exit) - Look the girls here, there different, I can\\'t talk to them!\\n\\nMarla - How are they different?\\n\\nBrian - I was taking to your English teacher today.\\n\\nMark - C\\'mon Dad please! It\\'s creepy enough around there without you snooping around.\\n\\nBrian - And she says you\\'ve got a great promise as a writer, but that you\\'re having trouble \\nconcentrating.\\n\\nMark - So when is Johnny gonna concentrate, get happy, get a girl friend and then write a \\nbest seller?\\n\\nBrian - Fine! You don\\'t listen, you don\\'t talk to me, you don\\'t talk to anyone, you hate \\neverything.\\n\\nMark - I can\\'t talk to you people and I certainly aint gonna see a shrink.\\n\\nBrian - Listen Mark! Everyone\\'s got problems, not just you, but you aint gonna solve \\nthem if you don\\'t communicate them.\\n\\n<Mark walks off>\\n\\nMarla - Okay! He\\'s gone back down stairs.\\n\\n<Downstairs>\\n\\nShep Sheppard - And so family and friends of Malcolm Kaiser sadly come and go into \\nthe night even as phantom DJ Happy Harry Hardon prepares to broadcast anonymously \\nfrom somewhere in this formerly peaceful community. This is Shep Sheppard reporting \\nlive from Paradise Hills, Arizona. Back to you Bill.\\n\\nMark - Yeah back to you.\\n\\n<If it be your will plays.The ten o\\'clock broadcast>\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - You see I never planned it like this. My dumb Dad got me this \\nshort wave radio set so I could just speak to my friends back east, but I couldn\\'t reach \\nanybody, I thought I was talking to nobody. I imagined that nobody listening. Maybe I \\nimagined one person out there, anyway one day I woke up and I realised I was never \\ngoing to be normal and so I said fuck it, I said so be it and Happy Harry Hardon was \\nborn. I never meant to hurt anyone, honestly I never meant to hurt anyone. I\\'m sorry \\nMalcolm. I never said \"Don\\'t do it\" I\\'m sorry. Erm anyway I\\'m done, stick a fork in me \\nit\\'s been grand. This is Happy Harry Hardon saying sionara, over and out.\\n\\nNora - Come on you can\\'t do this.\\n\\nPaige - This is a joke right?\\n\\nMazz - C\\'mon Harry baby, don\\'t stiff.\\n\\nMark - What am I doing. Fuck It!\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - You hear about some kid who did something stupid, something \\ndesperate. What possessed him. How could he do such a terrible thing. It\\'s really quite \\nsimple actually. Consider the life of a teenager. You have parents, teachers telling you \\nwhat to do. You have movies, magazines, and TV telling you what to do. But you know \\nwhat you have to do. Your job, your purpose, is to get accepted, get a cute girl friend, and \\nthink up something great to do with the rest of your life. What if you\\'re confused and \\ncan\\'t imagine a career? What if you\\'re funny looking and you can\\'t get a girl friend? You \\nsee no one wants to hear it, but the terrible secret is that being young is sometimes less \\nfun than being dead.\\n\\nShep Sheppard - This is great he\\'s making it worse.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Suicide is wrong, but the interesting thing about it is how \\nuncomplicated it seems. There you are, you got all these problems swarming around your \\nbrain, and here is one simple, one incredibly simple solution. I\\'m just surprised it doesn\\'t \\nhappen every day around here. No now they\\'re going to say I said offing yourself is \\nsimple, but no, no, no, no, it\\'s not simple. It\\'s like everything else you have to read the \\nfine print. For instance, assuming there is a heaven who would ever wanna go there, you \\nknow. I mean think about it, sitting on this cloud, you know it\\'s nice, it\\'s quiet, there\\'s no \\nteachers, there\\'s no parents, but guess what? There\\'s nothing to do. Fucking boring. \\nAnother thing to remember about suicide is that it is not a pretty picture. First of all, you \\nshit your shorts you know. So there you are dead, people are weeping over you, crying, \\ngirls you never spoke to are saying, \"Why? Why? Why?\" and you have a load in your \\nshorts. That\\'s the way I see it. Sue me. Now, they\\'re saying I shouldn\\'t think stuff like \\nthis. They\\'re saying something is wrong with me, that I should be ashamed. Well, I\\'m sick \\nof being ashamed. Aren\\'t you?\\n\\nNora - Sick to death!\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I don\\'t mind being dejected and rejected, but I\\'m not going to be \\nashamed about it.\\n\\nNora - Alleuelya\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - At least pain is real. You look around and you see nothing is real, \\nbut the pain is real. You know, even this show isn\\'t real. This isn\\'t me; I\\'m using a voice \\ndisguiser. I\\'m a phoney fuck just like my Dad, just like anybody. You see, the real me is \\njust as worried as the rest of you. They say I\\'m disturbed, well of course I\\'m disturbed. I \\nmean we\\'re all disturbed, and if we\\'re not, why not? Doesn\\'t this blend of blindness and \\nblandness want to make you do something crazy? Then why not do something crazy? It \\nmakes a hell of a lot of sense than blowing you fucking brains out you know. Go nuts, go \\ncrazy, get creative! You got problems? You just chuck\\'em, nuke\\'em! They think you\\'re \\nmoody? Make\\'em think you\\'re crazy, make\\'em think you might snap! They think you got \\nattitude? You show\\'em some real attitude! Come on, go nuts, get crazy. Hey no more Mr. \\nNice Guy. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, oh god!! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, oh yes. <Paige throws \\nall her stuff in the microwave and turns it on> <Henry Rollins plays> Time out! <Starts \\nto read a letter> This is good, this is really very interesting.<Happy Harry Hardon dials \\nthe phone>\\n\\nChris - Hello\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hi it\\'s me you\\'re on the air. Are you willing to tell my listeners \\nwhat you told me here in this letter? Do you think they\\'re ready to handle it.\\n\\nChris - I\\'m not ashamed.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - So tell us what happened.\\n\\nChris - This guy I knew, he invited me up to the ridge and I wasn\\'t really sure why, but I \\nwas really happy because he\\'s a pretty cool guy, he\\'s an athlete and everything.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - First of all where was this and how old are you.\\n\\nChris - It was just before school. I\\'m sixteen.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Go ahead.\\n\\nChris - So we get up there, we take our shirts off and we start fooling around and then I \\nsought of told him how much I liked him, he just smiled and said he knew it. But then, he \\nsays why don\\'t we take our pants off and get a tan, so I did it, but he stalled.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Go ahead.\\n\\nChris - Then two of his friends showed up and they were drinking beer and laughing and \\nthey took my clothes and threw them up in the trees. I didn\\'t know what to do. I started to \\ncry but they just laughed at me so I stopped and they just started calling me things. I don\\'t \\neven care about that. I know I\\'m into guys, but this was different.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - So what did you do?\\n\\nChris - Everything, everything they told me.\\n\\nDeaver - I\\'m calling the police. Fraud! Pornography! He\\'s just using these poor kids.\\n\\nPolice Dispatcher - That\\'s the thirteenth call tonight.\\n\\nPolice Officer - Sounds like the kids bull shitting to me.\\n\\nDetective #1 - I don\\'t know, these things happen when you\\'re a kid, you swallow it \\nDenny?\\n\\nDetective Denny - I think you\\'re forgetting what it\\'s like when you\\'re young.\\n\\nShep\\'s Boss - C\\'mon Shep. They got this kid to call in with this story they\\'ve concocted, \\nthis isn\\'t real.\\n\\nShep Sheppard - Who cares if it\\'s real? People are riveted.\\n\\nDetective Denny - No! If people are re-broadcasting this stuff over state lines, I think it\\'s \\ntime to call in the Feds. This is F.C.C. juristiction.\\n\\nChris - I feel bad that I didn\\'t even do anything. Now he wont even talk to me, he wont \\neven look at me. I\\'m pretty confused!\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Confused! You\\'re not the one who is confused. You sound like \\nyou know exactly what\\'s going on. If any ones confused it\\'s those guys out there.\\n\\nChris - I know, but I think about him a lot. I sometimes wonder why one person is born \\none way and another person is born another way..... Are you there?\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Yes, yes!\\n\\nChris - So I guess you think I\\'m a faggot wimp hey?\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - No! I\\'m just thinking how strong people can be and how everyone \\nis alike in some way, how everyone needs the same things.\\n\\nChris - So what are we going to do about this.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I don\\'t know. That\\'s the big question isn\\'t it hey?\\n\\nChris - I guess nobody knows hah. Well that\\'s tough, I got to go, se ya.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I guess we all got to go now. Good night pal, good night friends.\\n\\n<The Pixies \"Wave Of Mutilation\" plays>\\n\\n<Tomorrow in the school grounds>\\n\\nNora - \"Believe It Or Not I Care: 8:30 - 3:30.\" What\\'s that.\\n\\nJanie - Some new hot line Deaver\\'s setting up.\\n\\nNora - Hey it\\'s like 8:30 in the morning so it\\'s alright to kill myself!\\n\\nJanie - Oh my god it\\'s after 3:00 so I\\'m totally fucked.\\n\\n<Mark walks by>\\n\\nNora - Hi!\\n\\n<Mark ignores her>\\n\\nJanie - What are you doing........

I want a list of every student with relatives on the staff.\\n\\n<Murdock walks in>\\n\\nMurdock - Excuse me. I just found the graffiti on the roof of the cafeteria, they\\'re taking \\nit down now.\\n\\nCreswood - What\\'s it say?\\n\\nMurdock - \"Creswood\\'s a maggot puss wad.\"\\n\\n<Murdock sees Donald selling Happy Harry Hardon tapes by the lockers and takes him to \\nCreswood>\\n\\nDonald - Nobody knows who he is.\\n\\nCreswood - We don\\'t believe you Donald.\\n\\nDonald - I swear to you, nobody\\'s got an idea.\\n\\nMurdock - Well you\\'ve got to the end of the day to get an idea. Don\\'t forget, your file is \\nunder review.\\n\\nCreswood - You better bring all you enrolment files here to my office.\\n\\n<Back outside the lockers>\\n\\nDoug - So what did they do to you?\\n\\n<Donald shakes his head in disgust>\\n\\nJoey - Hey! You Donald?\\n\\nDonald - Yeah\\n\\nJoey - Hi! I\\'m Joey can you get me into the P.A.\\n\\n<The school alcove>\\n\\nCreswood - That\\'s the end of the music in The Alcove and from now on any found \\ndefacing of school property will be expelled.\\n\\n<Donald and Joey put a mix tape of Deaver squirming in conversation with Happy Harry \\nHardon>\\n\\nCreswood - What\\'s happening? What\\'s going on?\\n\\nMurdock - It\\'s Mr Deaver!\\n\\nMr Moore - It wont stop, they\\'re in the speaker system.\\n\\nCreswood - Shut it off, shut off the whole system.\\n\\nMr Moore - We can\\'t!\\n\\nCreswood - Shut down the whole school!\\n\\n<Shep Sheppard roles up outside Hubert Humphrey where Mazz lingers>\\n\\nMazz - Hey you!

People \\nare saying that Harry is introducing bad things and encouraging bad things. But it seems \\nto me that these things were already here. My god why don\\'t you people listen? He\\'s \\ntrying to tell you something is wrong with this school. Half the people that are here are on \\na probation of some kind. We are all really scared to be who we really are.

What are you doing? You having fun?\\n\\nMark - Yeah.\\n\\nNora - Hey, look I took some of these off the wall for you. I mistakingly thought you \\nmight want them.\\n\\nMark - Thanks.\\n\\nNora - So I guess you\\'re not going on tonight.\\n\\nMark - Brilliant.\\n\\nNora - Is this all just a game to you. You know you can\\'t just shout fire in a theatre and \\nwalk out. You have a responsibility for the people who believe in you. What is this? \\nC\\'mon say something, say anything. Open your mouth and say get the hell out of here \\nbitch.\\n\\nMark - I can\\'t.\\n\\nNora - You can\\'t what?\\n\\nMark - I can\\'t talk.\\n\\nNora - Sure you can talk.\\n\\nMark - I can\\'t talk to you.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I got a letter from this guy who\\'s got a problem, he can\\'t talk. I \\nmean he can talk, but never when he wants to, not to girls, not to people.\\n\\nBrian - I can\\'t believe it\\'s as bad as they say.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - He just opened up his mouth and nothing came out. And this jerk \\nfinds somebody that he likes, which is probably the worst thing to happen to a person \\nwho can\\'t talk. So I don\\'t know what to tell this guy because lately every time I give out \\nadvice the fit hits the shan. So I don\\'t know, maybe the best thing to do is just turn around \\nand face the music and try to talk.\\n\\nMarla - Mark!\\n\\nMark - Coming.\\n\\nMarla - Mark it\\'s just us. I wanna come in for a minute.\\n\\nMark - Yeah, just give me a second here, two seconds.\\n\\nBrian - Mark unlock the door.\\n\\nMarla - Mark can you hear us?\\n\\nMark - Yes, yes.\\n\\nMarla - We wanna come in.\\n\\nBrian -  Open the god dam door.\\n\\nMark - On my way.\\n\\n<Mark opens the door>\\n\\nBrian - Your mother and I have been out there for two minutes, what the hell are you \\ndoing in there.\\n\\nMark - I was just reading.\\n\\nMarla - Oh c\\'mon Mark we heard you, we heard you talking.\\n\\nMark - I was reading aloud.\\n\\nBrian - Oh c\\'mon do you really expect us to believe that?\\n\\nMark - Okay I\\'ll tell you the truth.\\n\\nNora - He was talking to me. Hi I\\'m Nora Diniro.\\n\\nMarla - Nice to meet you, how do you do.\\n\\nNora - I was afraid you would be mad at me for disturbing Mark\\'s homework.\\n\\nMarla - You don\\'t know how happy we are to meet you.\\n\\nNora - Listen I got to go, but it was really nice to have met you, bye Mark.\\n\\nMarla - No, you don\\'t have to go. Mark she doesn\\'t have to go.\\n\\nNora - Bye now, see you tomorrow.\\n\\n<Nora exits>\\n\\nBrian - You\\'ve been a bad dog haven\\'t you. You know for a second there we though you \\nwere that crazy DJ character.\\n\\nMark - Maybe he\\'s not that crazy Dad.\\n\\nBrian - Right! Very funny. Go get her, go on. <Brian and Marla exit> That\\'s my idea of \\nhome work.\\n\\nMarla - Yeah.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Sorry about that folks, technical difficulties. Lets see who we have \\nout there tonight hey. The usual band of teenage malcotets. I certainly hope so, because \\nHappy Harry Hardon is feeling kind of rude tonight.\\n\\nBrian - That little leech.\\n\\nMarla - Like father, like son.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Oh I feel good, dam <Happy Harry Hardon takes of his T Shirt> \\nWell, well, well, well. The big news! The emergency PTA meeting to discuss your truly. \\nYes all the professionals have come out to talk about little old me and now they\\'ve all run \\nhome to tune in and listen to what they\\'ve all been talking about. They say that I am \\ndillusioned, demented, deranged and so guess what I say, SO BE IT! I say rise up in the \\ncafeterias and stab them with your plastic forks. I say flogging and flactuance for Mrs \\nCreswood, she gets a hundred lashes for every kid she\\'s hounded out of that fucking \\nplace. I say down with all guidance councillors, make them work for a living. I can\\'t stay \\naway from this man. Oh I got to give him another call. Here I come Deave.\\n\\nPolice Dispatcher - Hot line. Believe it or not we care.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Believe it or not this is Happy Harry Hardon and I would like the \\npleasure of speaking to Mr Deaver.\\n\\nPolice Dispatcher - Just a moment, I\\'ll see if he\\'s available.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - I love it, the bitch is putting me on hold. I\\'m waiting for you. You \\ncan run, but you can not hide Mr Deaver. Waiting for the Deave.                                 \\n\\nDeaver - Hello my young friend.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - You\\'re in on it right Mr Deaver.\\n\\nDeaver - It\\'s all over son this phone call has been traced and who ever you are, your \\nHistory.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Well, so be it, alleuelya.\\n\\nMazz - Don\\'t just sit there man, run!\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Don\\'t worry about me, I\\'m alright. You see I bet what\\'s happening \\nout there is that the police are busting some old couple who have been un-knowingly \\nsupplying me with my phone fees. I am everywhere. I am inside each and every single \\none of you. Just look in and I will be there waving out at yeah, naked wearing only a cock \\nring, heh, heh. Wow, time flies when you\\'re on the run. I\\'m gonna cut out now with this \\nunusual song I\\'m dedicating to an unusual person who makes me feel kind of unusual.\\n\\n<Ivan Neville plays>\\n\\nNora - It\\'s okay you don\\'t have to talk, you don\\'t have to say anything and you don\\'t have \\nto do anything, unless you want to.\\n\\nMark - You\\'re so different. <Nora takes her top off> I meant your so fearless. I wish I \\ncould be like you.\\n\\nNora - You are.\\n\\nMark - I wish I could say things to you.\\n\\nNora - You do.\\n\\nMark - Everything\\'s so strange.\\n\\nNora - Yeah.\\n\\nMark - Maybe we\\'re just crazy.\\n\\nNora - So be it.\\n\\n<A police car pulls up nearby>\\n\\nNora - It\\'s the cops!\\n\\nMark - It\\'s okay. I think they\\'re just dropping in on my neighbour.\\n\\nNora - So are you really wearing a cock ring.\\n\\nMark - I\\'ve never even seen one.\\n\\nNora - Oh yeah.\\n\\nMark - Yeah, I read about them in a magazine.\\n\\nNora - Maybe I don\\'t believe you. <Tries to unzip Mark\\'s jeans>\\n\\nMark - I swear, what are you doing. I have neighbours, stop!\\n\\nNora - So you can talk when you want to.\\n\\nMark - Yes I can.\\n\\nNora - Maybe we should pause first stage personal identification. I got to go.\\n\\n<The next day outside Hubert Humphrey>\\n\\nShep Sheppard - It\\'s been three days since the death of Malcolm Kaiser and state and \\nlocal officials have still little idea of the identity of this so called Happy Harry Hardon or \\nthough many are convinced he is a student at this school.\\n\\n<Mark approaches Nora at the school gates>\\n\\nNora - Hi.\\n\\nMark - Are you okay.\\n\\nNora - Yeah, are you.\\n\\nMark - Yeah.\\n\\n<After a beautiful couple stalled attempts to kiss each other, their lips finally meet>\\n\\nNora - This is deep your message is out there. \"The Truth Is A Virus\"\\n\\nMark - Oh God! Jesus, this whole thing is making me ill.\\n\\nNora - Mark what is with you.\\n\\nMark - Look Nora last night was a mistake, I\\'m not going on any more, it\\'s over.\\n\\nNora - But your so close.\\n\\nMark - Close to what.\\n\\nNora - To getting your message across.\\n\\nMark - This is my life you\\'re screwing around with here you know.\\n\\nNora - Not any more it isn\\'t, this is everyone\\'s life. Mark you can\\'t leave it like this, \\npeople are confused.\\n\\nMark - So am I.\\n\\nNora - Mark!\\n\\nMark - The things fucked up, it\\'s crazy!\\n\\nNora - No, no the world is fucked up just like you said. Don\\'t you see that you\\'re the \\nvoice, you\\'re the voice we\\'re all waiting for.\\n\\nMark - You\\'re completely nuts. <Mark runs off>\\n\\nNora - Yeah, well you make me nuts.\\n\\n<Murdock scours the school to find Creswood\\'s so called troubled students>\\n\\n<Creswood\\'s office>\\n\\nCreswood <On the phone to Brian Hunter> - No Brian everything is under control. I\\'ve \\njust ordered psychiatric evaluations on a couple of the key trouble makers. I can do what \\never I like, it\\'s my school, Commissioner. No you\\'re not coming over here, you\\'ll only \\nupset me more good bye!\\n<Creswood turns her head to her key trouble makers> Well shall we have a look at these \\nfiles, or shall we discuss the identity of  our DJ friend.\\n\\n<Murdock turns off a Happy Harry Hardon tape in The Alcove>\\n\\nMurdock - Don\\'t push me people, you understand that. <People start making funny noises \\nbehind him>\\n\\nCheryl - They got forced to take me back.\\n\\n<Mazz appears to put some graffiti on the wall>\\n\\nMurdock - Where\\'re you going?\\n\\nMazz - I\\'m putting this up.\\n\\nMurdock - You\\'re not putting anything up. You\\'re not supposed to be here. <Murdock \\npushes Mazz>\\n\\nMazz - Hey, hey! Murdock you\\'re getting so touchy.\\n\\nMurdock - Your not supposed to be here. <Murdock attacks Mazz>\\n\\n<Jan & Creswood rush over>\\n\\nJan - Stop, that\\'s enough. What\\'s wrong with you? He was beating a student. What\\'s \\nwrong with this school?\\n\\nCreswood - Control yourself.\\n\\nJan - I will not. I want answers.\\n\\nCreswood - Or suffer the consequences.\\n\\nJan - What are you talking about.\\n\\nCreswood - I\\'m talking about your dismissal.\\n\\n<Outside the lockers>\\n\\nMark - Nora, I\\'ve been looking all over for you. I just wanted to apologise for saying you \\nwere nuts.\\n\\nNora - Forget it. Look <They both turn to the field with the F.C.C. vans> F.C.C. you \\nknow what that means.\\n\\nMark - Yeah, it means Federal Communication Commission. They can drive around and \\ntriangulate where ever the hell a radio signals coming from. I know exactly what it \\nmeans.\\n\\nNora - Yeah, so fuck it right. I mean it\\'s over. Frankly I don\\'t even give a shit.\\n\\nMark - What the hell is wrong.\\n\\nNora - I just got expelled.\\n\\nMark - What the hell are you talking about.\\n\\nNora - I\\'m failing Math.\\n\\nMark - They can\\'t kick you out for that.\\n\\nNora - I\\'ve been cutting lessons.\\n\\nMark - Well that just deserves a suspension right.\\n\\nNora - Well then I said \"Fuck You\" to Creswood. You should have seen her face, she was \\nso happy she said \"Thank You\"\\n\\nMark - This school sucks. Jesus Christ!\\n\\nNora - This is why I don\\'t even care anymore. Look just leave it alone. There\\'s nothing \\nyou can do about it. <Nora runs off>\\n\\nJan - Hunter! Hunter wait a minute. I just wanted to say good bye and good luck.\\n\\nMark - Why?\\n\\nJan - I was fired, I made a mistake. I thought I could change things, I forgot you don\\'t \\nrock the boat.\\n\\nMark - Yeah especially when you\\'re in it.\\n\\nJan - Hey, chin up.\\n\\n<Staff room>\\n\\nBrian - Loretta what the hell is going on here.\\n\\nCreswood - It\\'s the trouble makers, you can\\'t run a top school with trouble makers in the \\nmix.\\n\\nBrian - Okay, so what exactly is a trouble maker.\\n\\nCreswood - Someone who has no interest in education.\\n\\nBrian - Oh c\\'mon that includes every teenager I know.\\n\\nCreswood - Can\\'t you understand that nothing is more important than a good education.\\n\\nBrian -  Except for the basic right to it.\\n\\nCreswood - The point is I have the highest S.A.T. scores in the state.\\n\\nBrian - Yeah but how.\\n\\nCreswood - I stand by my record.\\n\\n<The School Field>\\n\\nShep Sheppard - Mr. Watts, Shep Sheppard Channel Six news here.\\n\\nWatts - Good evening.\\n\\nShep Sheppard - How does Washington intend to deal with this situation.\\n\\nWatts - We at the F.C.C. feel that democracy is about protecting the rights of the ordinary \\ncitizen. Un-regulated radio would result in programming of the lowest common \\ndenominator, the rule of the mob. <Watts looks round to see one of his F.C.C. vans has \\npicked up some graffiti> This is vandalism, not free expression.\\n\\n<Everyone gathers outside the school to listen to the Happy Harry Hardon show>\\n\\nMazz - Okay everybody, ten seconds to Happy Harry Hardon. Ten, nine, eight, seven, \\nsix, five, four, three, two, one. Harrrrrry! C\\'mon we\\'re right here waiting for you right \\nnow.\\n\\n<Mark turns up at Nora\\'s house>\\n\\nMark - Hi.\\n\\nNora - Hi.\\n\\nMark - Are you okay?\\n\\nNora - Yeah, fine, great, never been better.\\n\\nMark - We started something here.\\n\\nNora - We!\\n\\nMark - Alright I started, but now I need your help to finish it. Nora I need you.\\n\\nNora - Well it\\'s about time.\\n\\nMark - I\\'ve got something to show you.\\n\\nNora - Is it bigger than a baby\\'s arm.\\n\\nMark - No it\\'s outside. <Mark shows Nora his converted radio jeep>\\n\\nNora - Oh wow.\\n\\nMark - It\\'s my Mums jeep she kind of loaned it to me.\\n\\nNora - Who did all this?\\n\\nMark - Me and radio shack. You have driven a jeep before right?\\n\\n<Concrete Blondie plays and the F.C.C. vans go on the search of Happy Harry Hardon>\\n\\nMr. Watts - Personally I hope we get to hear from him a little bit before they nab him it \\nwill be interesting to see how hard he is then.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hello Dad we\\'re going to jail.\\n\\nNora - Say hi to Mom.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hi folks! It seems we have a new listener tonight. Mr Watts of the \\nF.C.C. Hi Arthur thanks for coming out.\\n\\nWatts - Well thank you for coming out.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Imagine a fucking political hag being in charge of free speech in \\nAmerica. I bet Watts was the guy who took names at high school when the teacher was \\nabsent.\\n\\nWatts - This is the problem with free speech. Would you cut that thing, cut it off. Would \\nyou just turn the dam thing off. He\\'s obviously moving just pull everything over on \\nwheels.\\n\\nHappy Harry Hardon - Welcome to radio free America. America\\'s ready, I\\'m ready. I \\nwant a million voices crying out in the wilderness. Jesus let\\'s get serious. Maybe Mr. \\nWatts can shed some light no the mysterious disappearances of some of our students. \\nLuis Chavez age fifteen, legally kicked out on September 26th. Arthur Washington age \\nsixteen, expelled September 27th.\\n\\nCreswood - So what does this prove, not everyone goes to college.\\n\\nMurdock -Right.\\n\\nJan - Mr. Hunter I think you should be aware of something. After the school received the \\nmoney from the government for every enrolled student, Mrs Creswood would then \\nproceed to weed out those she felt were undesirable.\\n\\nCreswood - Nonsense she doesn\\'t know what she\\'s talking about.\\n\\nJan - In the first weeks you flagged all the pupils with low S.A.T. scores and started files \\non them. Why?\\n\\nCreswood - What are you doing with school property?\\n\\nBrian - She asked you why.\\n\\nJan - For extra tutoring.\\n\\nBrian - You expelled over twenty students in the first thirty days of school.\\n\\nJan - And how many others did you harass into dropping out.\\n\\nBrian - And you kept the expelled students names on the rolls that\\'s illegal.\\n\\nCreswood - The money went to the school, it was all for the good of the school.\\n\\nJan - Those kids had rights.\\n\\nCreswood - They were losers.\\n\\nMurdock - Trouble makers.\\n\\nDeaver - They\\'re just kids.\\n\\nCreswood - I don\\'t regret my policy.\\n\\nBrian - It\\'s criminal and I\\'m suspending you.\\n\\nCreswood - You can\\'t do that.\\n\\nBrian - Oh I\\'m afraid I just did.\\n\\n<Nora hits a bump trying to avoid the F.C.C. vans as she goes off road near the school \\ngrounds>\\n\\nMark - Oh Jesus my harmoniser.\\n\\nNora - Forget it, hold on I\\'ve got to get us out off here.\\n\\nMark - I need that to disguise my voice.\\n\\nNora - Well give me a minute maybe we can fix it.\\n\\nMark - <Looks at the people gathered at the school> Jesus look at this. Fuck it, I\\'m going \\non with out it.\\n\\nNora - No, I think I got it.\\n\\nMark - Okay this is really me now, no more hiding. Listen we\\'re all worried, we\\'re all in \\npain, that just comes with having eyes with having ears, but just remember one thing it \\ncan\\'t get any worse, it can only get better. I mean high school is the bottom. Being a \\nteenager sucks, but that\\'s the point, surviving it is the whole point. Quitting is not going \\nto make you strong, living will. So just hang on and hang in there.  You know I know all \\nabout the hating and the sneering, I\\'m a member of the why bother generation myself. But \\nwhy did I bother coming out here tonight and why did you? I mean it\\'s time, it begins \\nwith us not with politicians, the experts of the teachers, but with us, with you and with \\nme, the ones who need it most. I believe with everything that\\'s in me that the whole world \\nis begging for healing, even the trees and the earth its self are crying out for it, you can \\nhear it everywhere. It\\'s the same kind of healing I desperately needed and finally feel has \\nbegun with you.<A police chopper appears over head> Everyone mix it up, it\\'s not game \\nover yet, it\\'s just the beginning, but it\\'s up to you. I\\'m calling for every kid to seize the air. \\nSteal it, it belongs to you. Speak out, they can\\'t stop you. Find your voice and use it. Keep \\nthis going. Pick a name, go on air. It\\'s your life, take charge of it. Do it, try it, try \\nanything. Spill your guts out and say shit and fuck a million times if you want to, but you \\ndecide. Fill the air, steal it.

Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: So , um\\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\\nProject Manager: Hmm .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\\nProject Manager: F_ five .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nUser Interface: Agree .\\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nUser Interface: Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\\nMarketing: So anyway\\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\\nUser Interface: Functions .\\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\\nMarketing: I can go back .\\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\\nMarketing: yeah ?\\nUser Interface: so\\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\\nUser Interface: Okay .\\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\\nProject Manager: That's good point .\\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Argh .\\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\\nIndustrial Designer: li\\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\\nUser Interface: Findings .\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: Concept .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\\nMarketing: Mm .\\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\\nProject Manager: {gap}\\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\\nProject Manager: It's off .\\nMarketing: Hmm .\\nProject Manager: It's on .\\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\\nProject Manager: Mm .\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\\nProject Manager: Yeah .\\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\\nProject Manager: Hmm .\\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\\nMarketing: Or is it ?\\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: Yeah .\\nMarketing: yeah .\\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: B yeah .\\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: And it's only next .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: Yeah\\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\\nProject Manager: uh current chan\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\\nProject Manager: Yeah .\\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\\nProject Manager: Mm .\\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: so\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\\nProject Manager: Mm .\\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\\nMarketing: Cheap .\\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\\nMarketing: Couple of words .\\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nUser Interface: Um .\\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\\nMarketing: Okay .\\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\\nUser Interface: Okay. .\\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\\nMarketing: T_V_ .\\nProject Manager: Okay .\\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\\nProject Manager: Mm .\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\\nMarketing: no ?\\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\\nMarketing: And volume control .\\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: Hmm .\\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\\nUser Interface: Okay .\\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\\nProject Manager: No .\\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\\nProject Manager: mm\\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\\nMarketing: Difficult .\\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\\nMarketing: No .\\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\\nUser Interface: control ,\\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ?

The film tells a story of five lifelong friends who won their junior high school basketball championship in 1978. They reunite three decades later for a 4th of July weekend after learning about the sudden death of their basketball coach.\\nProduced by Sandler\\'s Happy Madison Productions in association with Relativity Media, Grown Ups was released in the United States on June 25, 2010, by Columbia Pictures. Despite receiving unfavorable reviews from critics, it grossed $272 million and led to a sequel, Grown Ups 2, in 2013.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1978, childhood friends Lenny Feder, Eric Lamonsoff, Kurt McKenzie, Marcus Higgins, and Rob Hilliard win their junior high basketball championship. They celebrate at a lake house with their coach Robert \"Buzzer\" Ferdinando.\\nThirty years later in 2008, Lenny is a wealthy and successful Hollywood talent agent, married to fashion designer Roxanne and has three children: Greg, Keith, and Becky. Eric claims to co-own a lawn furniture company and has two children: Donna and Bean; his wife Sally still breastfeeds Bean. Kurt is a stay-at-home father, and has two children: Andre and Charlotte, his wife Deanne is pregnant with their third child, and her mother Ronzoni lives with them. Marcus is a slacker and lothario. Rob is married to his much older fourth wife Gloria.\\nWhen Buzzer dies, the five friends reunite for his funeral in their hometown with their families. Lenny rents the Earnshaw family\\'s lake house for everyone to stay over Fourth of July weekend, though his family is leaving early to attend Roxanne\\'s fashion show in Milan. He pushes his boys to play outside and runs into his childhood opponent Dickie, who claims Lenny\\'s foot was out of bounds when he made the winning shot.\\nAs the friends spread Buzzer\\'s ashes, Rob breaks down over his failed marriages and reveals that he has invited his estranged daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget to visit. The men play “arrow roulette”, shooting an arrow straight into the air, and Rob wins by not running for cover, but the arrow impales his left foot, causing him to \\'snap\\' at Gloria from the pain. \\nLenny is thrilled to find the kids playing with cup-and-string telephones. Realizing the positive impact the weekend is having on their children, Roxanne tells Lenny to cancel their Milan trip and stay at the lake instead.\\nEveryone visits Water Wizz where Marcus flirts with Jasmine and Amber after buying them skimpy bikinis, and Eric teaches Bean to drink cow\\'s milk. The families cause chaos throughout the park: the wives attract a bodybuilder, then jeer at his high-pitched Canadian accent; Rob assaults a slide attendant when he insults Bridget, and Eric ignores Donna\\'s warning about a chemical in the pool that turns urine blue. At the zipline attraction, Lenny\\'s group meets up with Dickie, accompanied by his former teammates. One of them, Wiley, is severely injured after crashing into a shed while sliding down the zipline using his feet.\\nThe next day, Rob attacks Marcus, mistakenly believing that he slept with Jasmine, and Marcus admits to feeling insecure compared to his happily married friends. Everyone comes clean about the state of their lives: Roxanne confronts Lenny for canceling their flight to Milan before they left home, and he explains he wanted their family to have a normal vacation and to rein in his children\\'s respectful attitudes; Deanne confronts Kurt for spending time with the Feders\\' nanny Rita, but Kurt retaliates by pointing out how she under-appreciates him; Eric reveals that he was laid off from his job, and was showing off the whole time so the others wouldn\\'t humiliate him; Rob admits what everybody already knows – that he wears a toupee. Gloria helps everyone reconcile, and Lenny and Kurt offer to help Eric start a new business.\\nOn their last day at the lake house, Lenny and his friends agree to a rematch against Dickie, Robideaux, Muzby, Tardio, and Malcolm. The game culminates in Lenny and Greg facing Dickie and his son, but Lenny misses the game-deciding shot. As the families watch the Fourth of July fireworks, Lenny tells Roxanne that he let Dickie\\'s family win to get him off his case, and felt that his own family needed to know what losing feels like. A drunken Marcus plays another game of arrow roulette, and the crowd flees in panic. Trapped in a full-body cast, Wiley is struck in the foot by the arrow.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nSandler, Rock, Schneider, and Spade met when they all joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in the 1990–1991 season; supporting cast members Colin Quinn, Rudolph, Tim Meadows, and Norm Macdonald have also been SNL cast members.\\nFilming commenced in Essex County, Massachusetts, in August 2009.

The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Grown Ups\\' cast of comedy vets is amiable, but they\\'re let down by flat direction and the scattershot, lowbrow humor of a stunted script.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 30 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.Connie Ogle of the Miami Herald referred to it as \"the perfect poster child for this maddening summer of movie mediocrity.\" Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail criticized what he saw as blatant commercialism, saying the cast \"lob[bed] gags they surely disdain at an audience they probably despise while reserving their own laughter for that off-camera dash all the way to the bank.\" Richard Roeper went as far as to say that it was \"a blight upon the bright canvas of American cinema\", and that he hated it. Tom Long of the Detroit News called it \"trite comedy\" and \"total garbage.\" On the other end of the spectrum, Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post called it \"crude and decent-hearted\" and \"easy, breezy, predictable.\"\\n\\nAwards\\nRob Schneider was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor for the film, but lost to Jackson Rathbone for both The Last Airbender and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.The film won at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards for the \"Best Line from a Movie\" category, which it won for the line \"I want to get chocolate wasted!\", delivered by Becky, played by Alexys Nycole Sanchez.\\n\\nHome media\\nGrown Ups was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 9, 2010.\\n\\nSequel\\nA sequel, titled Grown Ups 2, was released on July 12, 2013.

Between trying to keep the family farm up and running and her job in the village shop, run by the slightly mad Mrs. Docherty, she also has three boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie and Vincent. When her children\\'s two wealthy, but pompous and snobby city cousins, Cyril and Celia, are evacuated to live with them in the countryside, they start fighting with them, only adding to Isabel\\'s problems.\\nWhen the magical Nanny McPhee arrives to help, the children at first do not listen and carry on fighting, which she soon puts a stop to with her magic. Meanwhile, Isabel\\'s brother-in-law Phil has gambled away his half of the farm, and is being chased by two hired female assassins working for casino owner Mrs. Biggles. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using mean and spiteful schemes to leave her no choice; one of the schemes, setting loose a litter of piglets to be sold to a neighbouring farmer, is discovered by the children, leading them to bond as they work together to fix it. Isabel takes everyone on a picnic as a show of thanks, during which Mrs. Docherty\\'s ARP Warden husband warns them about bombs and relates how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release one, and Phil subsequently delivers a telegram saying Rory was killed in action. Everyone believes the news except Norman, who is sure his father is alive because he \"can feel it in [his] bones\". He tells this to Cyril, who at first thinks he is just upset, but then agrees that Norman might be right; the two convince Nanny McPhee to take them to the War Office in London, where Cyril and Celia\\'s father Lord Gray holds an important position, believing he will know the truth.\\nAt first Lord Gray sneers at Norman\\'s disbelief at his father\\'s death, but after Cyril reveals that he knows he is divorcing their mother and blasts him for his neglect as a parent, Lord Gray investigates what has happened. While he is gone, Norman asks Cyril where he will live following the divorce; upon learning he rarely sees either of his parents, he says that he and Celia are welcome to live permanently with the Greens. Lord Gray returns and tells Norman that his father is merely missing in action, and that there is no record of a telegram being sent to his mother. After the boys leave, Norman deduces that Phil forged the telegram.\\nWhile the older boys are at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent try to stop Isabel from signing Phil\\'s papers and selling the farm by creating distractions such as pretending that a mouse was in the kitchen. Just as she is about to finally do so, a German pilot accidentally drops a huge bomb on the Greens\\' barley field; it does not explode, but the fallout is strong enough to cover Phil\\'s papers with ink. When Nanny McPhee, Norman and Cyril return, Phil admits to Norman\\'s accusation of forgery and is handcuffed to the stove by Isabel. The children go out to watch Mr. Docherty defuse the bomb, but when he faints, Megsie takes over, succeeding with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee\\'s jackdaw friend Mr. Edelweiss. Nanny McPhee helps to harvest the barley with a little magic, saving Phil from Mrs. Biggles\\' hitwomen in the process. While everyone celebrates, Mrs. Docherty is revealed to be baby Agatha from the first film and to remember Nanny McPhee, who has been staying with her. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now-happy Isabel and the children, they chase after her, only to see Rory, with an injured arm, making his way back to them. He runs to his family and they embrace.\\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ellie, an elephant conjured by Nanny McPhee to share Vincent\\'s bed, is seen enjoying the magically operated Scratch-o-matic invented for the piglets.\\n\\nCast\\nEmma Thompson as Nanny McPhee, the  nanny who changes the lives of the Green and Gray children.\\nMaggie Gyllenhaal as Isabel Green (née Carrington), the frazzled mother of Norman, Megsie and Vincent.\\nRhys Ifans as Phil Green, Norman, Megsie and Vincent\\'s uncle, Rory\\'s brother and Isabel\\'s brother-in-law, who tries to sell the farm because he gambled it away at a casino.\\nAsa Butterfield as Norman Green, the eldest of the Green children.\\nLil Woods as Megan “Megsie” Green, the middle and only girl of the Green children.\\nOscar Steer as Vincent Green, the youngest of the Green children.\\nEros Vlahos as Cyril Gray, the spoiled cousin of Norman, Megsie and Vincent.

It was also written by Allan Loeb with music by Rupert Gregson-Williams. The film co-stars Henry Winkler and Salma Hayek. It was produced by Happy Madison Productions. The film was released in the United States on October 12, 2012, by Columbia Pictures. The film\\'s title is taken from the song \"Boom\" by Christian nu-metal band P.O.D.\\n\\nPlot\\nFormer Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the $48,000 necessary to keep the music program. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko requests outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko\\'s apartment, he learns that Niko is a former MMA fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko\\'s apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA.\\nScott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only $750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out opponent \"Lucky\" Patrick Murray and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his goal. While Marty trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott\\'s students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gains greater amounts of money for the school.\\nScott has been pursuing the school nurse, Bella Flores, and they share moments flirting with each other, while also rekindling Scott\\'s passion for teaching. He begins to engage the class and earns the respect of his students. Scott is within $6,000 of his goal when Mark tells him that Niko turned down a sanctioned UFC fight offered by Joe Rogan, with the certainty of earning $10,000 for a loss. Scott confronts Niko, who apologizes and admits he turned it down because he was jealous as he was once asked to fight at the UFC but suffered a neck injury while training, ending his career. Scott and Niko accept the offer, and they travel to the MGM Grand Las Vegas for the fight. The night he arrives, Bella calls Scott to tell him that the school\\'s vice principal Robert Elkins has been arrested for embezzling from the school, including Scott\\'s winnings. All Scott\\'s efforts have been in vain, and he decides he must win the fight and the $50,000.\\nThe publicity of Scott\\'s rise to fame has grown, and the school\\'s band appears in the stands to play his theme song, \"Holly Holy\" by Neil Diamond, thanks to Bella contacting Rogan. During the fight, Marty reminds the losing Scott that even if he does not win, he has inspired the students, which is their real purpose as teachers. Scott has no answer to his dangerous opponent Ken Dietrich, who is angered that his original opponent canceled and that he is stuck with a man that \"does not deserve\" to be fighting at the UFC. Scott struggles to survive the first two rounds, but after finding inspiration from the students, he manages to win in the third and final round of the fight, earning $50,000 and Dietrich\\'s respect. Scott and Bella kiss through the chain link fence of the ring.\\nIn the closing scene, the music program is saved, the school is operating on a normal budget thanks to Scott\\'s donation and Niko and all of the students in Scott\\'s citizenship class attend their American citizenship ceremony.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nFilming began on March 28, 2011, in and around the Boston, Massachusetts, area.

Anderson is critical of the different clashing tones of the film, but calls the characters likable, and writes the \"violence adds a frisson of tension to the pic’s mix of grappling, romance and anemic social critique.\"Entertainment Weekly\\'s Lisa Schwarzbaum called it \"A cloddish, harmlessly drecky comedy from the Sandler factory of crude mush.\"\\nNathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote: \"Here Comes The Boom seems to have made it from the pitch stage - Kevin James does MMA to save his school or something! - to the big screen without an iota of inspiration, ambition, or personality seeping in at any juncture.\"\\nMarc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle wrote: \"\"Here Comes the Bomb\" would\\'ve been a more fitting title, but props to Henry Winkler for rising to the occasion and turning in a sweet, idealistic performance in a film that otherwise feels like a tawdry commercial for the UFC and MMA.\"\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nHere Comes the Boom was chosen as one of ten best films for family audiences by the 21st Annual Movieguide Awards on February 15, 2013.\\nPassage 4:\\nSau Crore\\nSau Crore (lit.\\u2009\\'Hundred crores\\') is a 1991 Indian film starring, produced and directed by Dev Anand.

The movie has played over 60 festivals, winning over 20 awards. It had its American theatrical release on September 12, 2008, on a limited basis.The film is set (and was shot) on the New Jersey shore, mainly in Lavallette.\\n\\nPlot\\nStill reeling from the death of her father, a young girl spends one last summer at the Jersey Shore before heading off to college. But when her plans fall apart, the girl stumbles into a mysterious world of Russian sailors, high-stakes gambling, and unexpected love.\\n\\nCast\\nKim Shaw as Jenny Chambers\\nPaul Sorvino as Catch Turner\\nDavid Fumero as Benicio Aceveda\\nJay O.

That’s the effect Paul Sorvino has in Greetings From the Shore, a watchable-enough summer-at-the-beach tale billed as Gabrielle Berberich’s first feature as writer and producer...until Mr. Sorvino, a real actor and a good one, shows up. He plays a down-on-his-luck fisherman who takes the girl under his wing, and he makes Ms. Shaw and some of the other cast members look like amateurs. The director, Greg Chwerchak (who also gets a writing credit), doesn’t help; he allows several secondary characters to become thudding clichés, trampling the delicate story.\"Film critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the web based Spirituality & Practice, discussed the basic theme of the film, \"Jenny\\'s summer teaches her to go with the flow when her life plan is upset. She also learns that the universe is set up in such a felicitous way that when a door closes, a window opens.\"Critic David Hiltbrand liked the film, writing, \"It\\'s a formulaic and familiar plot, the Jersey girl version of The Flamingo Kid. But it unfolds smoothly, thanks to Greg Chwerchak\\'s focused direction. And the water down on Barnegat Inlet Island looks oddly idyllic on film. Greetings From the Shore is well-acted, including by newcomer Shaw, who has an appealing, wide-eyed innocence reminiscent of a young Meg Ryan. This is a two-hankie weeper that doesn\\'t really earn its tears. But it\\'s a sweet little movie nonetheless.\"\\n\\nAwards\\nWins\\n\\nBare Bones International Film Festival, 2008 - Won, Festival Recognition: Instrumental Score - Jim Latham\\nColumbus International Film & Video Festival, 2007 - Won, Bronze Plaque Award: Entertainment - Greg Chwerchak\\nGreat Lakes Film Festival, 2007 - Won, Grand Jury Prize: Best Narrative Feature; Best of the Fest; Best Director - Greg Chwerchak; Best Lead Actress - Kim Shaw\\nRed Rock Film Festival, 2007 - Won, Audience Award: Best Narrative Feature - Gabrielle Berberich, Greg Chwerchak\\nWild Rose Independent Film Festival, 2007 - Won, WRIFF Award: Best Acting Ensemble, Best Screenplay, Best Feature, Best Director of a Feature, Certificate of Distinctive Achievement: Best Sound, Best Cinematography/Videography, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Editing\\nFargo Film Festival, 2008 - Won, Best Narrative Feature, Best Screenplay - Gabrielle Berberich, Greg Chwerchak\\nGarden State Film Festival, 2008 - Won, Audience Award: Pick of the Flicks; Home Grown Award: Best Feature - Gabrielle Berberich, Greg Chwerchak\\nGeorge Lindsey UNA Film Festival, 2008 - Won, Honorable Mention: Professional Full-Length Feature\\nTupelo Film Festival, 2008 - 2nd Place, Festival Prize: Best Feature - Gabrielle Berberich, Greg Chwerchak\\nWorldFest-Houston International Film Festival, 2008 - Won, Special Jury Award: Best Feature - Gabrielle Berberich, Greg Chwerchak\\nPassage 7:\\nSylvia Fine\\nSylvia Fine Kaye (August 29, 1913 – October 28, 1991) was an American lyricist, composer, and producer. Many of her compositions and productions were performed by her husband, comedian Danny Kaye. Fine was a Peabody Award-winner and was nominated for two Academy Awards and two Emmys during her career. She won an Emmy award in 1976 for children\\'s special.\\n\\nEarly life\\nSylvia Fine was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of three children of a Jewish dentist, and raised in East New York. She attended Thomas Jefferson High School and studied music at Brooklyn College, where she wrote the music for the school\\'s alma mater, with lyrics from the poet Robert Friend.\\n\\nCareer and Danny Kaye\\nShe was working as an audition pianist when she met Danny Kaye; both were working on a short-lived Broadway show, The Straw Hat Revue. Fine wrote the lyrics and music for the show. Although the pair had never met before, they discovered some things in common.  They were both born in Brooklyn, and Kaye had once worked for Fine\\'s father, watching his office while the dentist went to lunch. Dr. Fine had fired his future son-in-law for doing woodworking with his dental drills.He proposed on the telephone while working in Florida; Fine was in New York. She made the trip to Fort Lauderdale where they were married on January 3, 1940.She took a direct role in managing her husband\\'s career and wrote many of his songs for him, both in film and recordings.  Those for the film The Court Jester were co-written with Sammy Cahn. She was an associate producer of some of the films. Fine received a Peabody Award in 1980, and during her career she was also nominated for two Oscars and two Emmys. She began working in television production with her husband\\'s 1960s television shows.The New York Times reported, \"In the 1970s, [Fine] embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. She produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program Musical Comedy Tonight (eventually a three-part series), earning her a Peabody Award in 1979.In 1975 she was executive producer for the television special \"Danny Kaye: Look in at the Metropolitan opera.\"She produced and edited Assignment Children, a UNICEF film that starred her husband. In the last three years of her life, she had been writing a book about her life with Kaye, Fine and Danny, for Knopf Books.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFine and Kaye had a daughter, Dena (born December 17, 1946). They separated in September 1947, attributing the separation to \"two people working very hard.\" They reunited seven months later, and remained married until his death in 1987.\\nIn 1992, her daughter Dena Kaye was quoted in a newspaper article, recalling Fine\\'s advice to her and the influence it had in her life. Both Fine and Kaye were determined not to influence their daughter\\'s choices as she grew up. In a 1954 interview, Kaye stated that \"Whatever she (Dena) wants to be she will be without interference from her mother nor from me.\" Dena grew up to become a journalist.\\n\\nDeath\\nSylvia Fine Kaye died of emphysema at the age of 78 in her Manhattan apartment in 1991. She is buried with her husband at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.\\n\\nLegacy\\nThe careers of Fine and Kaye are documented in The Danny Kaye and Sylvia Fine Collection at the Library of Congress.

Although it became a blues standard, music critic Charles Shaar Murray calls it \"the greatest pop song he ever wrote\". \"Boom Boom\" was both an American R&B and pop chart success in 1962 and a UK top-twenty hit in 1992.\\nThe song is one of Hooker\\'s most identifiable and enduring songs and \"among the tunes that every band on the [early 1960s UK] R&B circuit simply had to play\".  It has been recorded by numerous blues and other artists, including a 1965 North American hit by the Animals.\\n\\nRecording and composition\\nPrior to recording for Vee-Jay Records, John Lee Hooker was primarily a solo performer or  accompanied by a second guitarist, such as early collaborators Eddie Burns or Eddie Kirkland. However, with Vee-Jay, he usually recorded with a small backing band, as heard on the singles \"Dimples\", \"I Love You Honey\", and \"No Shoes\". Detroit keyboardist Joe Hunter, who had previously worked with Hooker, was again enlisted for the recording session. Hunter brought with him \"the cream of the Motown label\\'s session men, later known as the Funk Brothers\": bassist James Jamerson, drummer Benny Benjamin, plus guitarist Larry Veeder, tenor saxophonist Hank Cosby, and baritone saxophonist Andrew \"Mike\" Terry. They have been described as \"just the right band\" for \"Boom Boom\". Hooker had a unique sense of timing, which demanded \"big-eared sidemen\".The original \"Boom Boom\" is an uptempo (168 beats per minute) blues song, which has been notated in 2/2 time in the key of F.  It has been described as \"about the tightest musical structure of any Hooker composition: its verses sedulously adhere to the twelve-bar format over which Hooker generally rides so roughshod\". The song uses \"a stop-time hook that opens up for one of the genre\\'s most memorable guitar riffs\" and incorporates a middle instrumental section Hooker-style boogie.According to Hooker, he wrote the song during an extended engagement at the Apex Bar in Detroit.\\n\\nI would never be on time [for the gig]; I always would be late comin\\' in.  And she [the bartender Willa] kept saying, \"Boom boom – you late again\".  Every night: \"Boom, boom – you late again\".  I said \"Hmm, that\\'s a song!\" ... I got it together, the lyrics, rehearsed it, and I played it at the place, and the people went wild.\\nAlso included are several wordless phrases, \"how-how-how-how\" and \"hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm\".  \"Boom Boom\" became the Hooker song that is \"the most memorable, the most instantly appealing, and the one which has proved the most adaptable to the needs of other performers\". ZZ Top later used similar lines (\"how-how-how-how\") for their popular \"La Grange\".\\n\\nReleases and charts\\nWhen \"Boom Boom\" was released as a single in April or May 1962, the song became a hit.  It entered the Billboard Hot R&B Sides chart on June 16, 1962, where it spent eight weeks and reached number 16. The song also appeared the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 60, making it one of only two Hooker singles to enter the broader chart. It was included on the 1962 Vee-Jay album Burnin\\'  as well as many Hooker compilations, including John Lee Hooker: The Ultimate Collection. \\nTwo years later, in 1964, the song made a brief appearance on the chart in Walloon Belgium, which at the time did not rank positions.  In 1992, after being featured in a Lee Jeans commercial, the \"Boom Boom\" reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. It also appeared on charts in New Zealand (number 24 in 1992) and France (numbers 45 in 1993 and 87 in 2013).Hooker recorded several later versions. Following the success of the Animals\\' version, Hooker re-recorded the song in 1968 for Stateside Records as the B-side of \"Cry Before I Go\" under the longer title \"Boom Boom Boom\".  He reworked the song as \"Bang Bang Bang Bang\" for his Live at Soledad Prison album, as a South Side Chicago street musician in the film The Blues Brothers (but the song itself is not included in the film soundtrack), and as the title track for his 1992 album Boom Boom with Jimmie Vaughan.\\n\\nThe Animals version\\nEnglish rock band the Animals recorded \"Boom Boom\" for their 1964 UK debut album The Animals.  Their blues-rock rendition generally follows John Lee Hooker\\'s original, although they add \"shake it baby\" as a response to the \"come on and shake\" refrain in the middle section, taken from Hooker\\'s \"Shake It Baby\" (recorded during the 1962 American Folk Blues Festival tour in Europe, where it became a hit in 1963).The Animals\\' version was released as a single in North America in November 1964 and is included on the Animals\\' second American album, The Animals on Tour. It reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 14 on the Canadian RPM Top 40&5 singles chart. The song also appeared on the unranked chart in Wallonia.Cash Box described it as \"a rousing salute to the apple of a guy\\'s eye\" that\\'s \"exciting, funky-styled\" and \"a great swinger.\"Over the years, several versions of \"Boom Boom\" have been recorded by various Animals reunion lineups as well as by former members Eric Burdon and Alan Price. In 2012, the original 1964 version was used in the film Skyfall.\\n\\nBig Head Todd and the Monsters version\\nAmerican rock group Big Head Todd and the Monsters recorded \"Boom Boom\" for their album Beautiful World (1997). Group bassist Rob Squires described the recording session: \"Hooker has just this incredible presence. He walked into the room and literally everyone was intimidated including our producer and the people who work in the studio.\"  Beginning with the television series debut of NCIS: New Orleans in 2014, a portion of Big Head Todd\\'s version has been used as the opening theme.\\n\\nRecognition and legacy\\nIn 1995, John Lee Hooker\\'s \"Boom Boom\" was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s list of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".  It was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2009 in the \"Classics of Blues Recording\" category. A Detroit Free Press poll in 2016 ranked the song at number 37 in \"Detroit\\'s 100 Greatest Songs\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked Hooker\\'s version at number 463 on its 2021 list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", down from number 220 on its 2004 list.\\nPassage 11:\\nBeethoven (TV series)\\nBeethoven is a 1994  American Saturday morning cartoon television series loosely based on the 1992 motion picture of the same name.  The series was produced by Northern Lights Entertainment and Universal Cartoon Studios, and aired for one season on CBS Saturday Mornings, with 13 episodes with two 10 minute segments produced. Dean Jones, who played Dr. Varnick in the film, voiced the role of George Newton; Nicholle Tom, who played teenage daughter Ryce in the film and Beethoven\\'s 2nd, was the only cast member from the films to reprise her role in the series.\\n\\nPremise\\nThe Newton family love Beethoven, their St. Bernard dog. But the father, George, has his moments with Beethoven, who gets in different mishaps time after time. When not with the Newton family, Beethoven spends time with three other dogs, Sparky (the stray from the first film), Ginger, and Caesar.\\nUnlike the film, Beethoven has a speaking voice, at least among the other animals. The same plot was used in another animated series, Free Willy, where the main character also could talk.\\n\\nCast\\nAdditional voices\\nCrew\\nPaul Germain - Producer, Story Editor and Voice Director\\n\\nEpisodes\\nHome release\\nUniversal and Goodtimes released episodes of the show on VHS. In July 2020, the series became available on the Peacock streaming service.\\nPassage 12:\\nSonny & Cher\\nSonny & Cher were an American pop and entertainment duo in the 1960s and 1970s, made up of spouses Sonny Bono and Cher. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as R&B backing singers for record producer Phil Spector.\\nThe pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, \"Baby Don\\'t Go\" and \"I Got You Babe\". Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, Good Times and Chastity, with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, \"Chastity\\'s Song (Band of Thieves)\". In 1972, after three years of silence, the couple returned to the studio and released two other albums under the MCA/Kapp Records label.\\nIn the 1970s, they also positioned themselves as media personalities with two top ten TV shows in the US, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny & Cher Show. The couple\\'s career as a duo ended in 1975 following their divorce. In the decade they spent together, Sonny and Cher were nominated for two Grammy Awards and sold over 40 million records worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked them No. 18 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.Performing under her first name, Cher went on to a highly successful career as a solo singer and actress, while Sonny Bono was eventually elected to Congress as a Republican U.S. Representative from California. The two performers were inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998, following Sonny\\'s death in a skiing accident.\\n\\nCareer\\n1962–1964: The origin\\nCherilyn Sarkisian first met Salvatore Bono in a Los Angeles coffee shop in November 1962, when she was sixteen. Eleven years her senior, Bono was working for record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The two became best friends, eventual lovers, and were supposedly married in 1964, but Bono says in his autobiography that it was not an official marriage. They were legally wed after their only child, Chaz, was born. Through Bono, Cher started as a session singer, and sang backup on several of Spector\\'s classic recordings, including \"Be My Baby\" by the Ronettes, \"You\\'ve Lost That Loving Feeling\" by The Righteous Brothers and Darlene Love\\'s \"A Fine, Fine Boy\". In Darlene Love\\'s recording, the listener can clearly hear Cher and Sonny close to the mic (along with Love, who recorded her own backing vocals).\\n\\n1965–1966: Career development\\nWith Bono continuing to write, arrange and produce the songs, the couple\\'s first incarnation was as the duo \"Caesar and Cleo\". They released some singles in 1964, including \"The Letter\", with Vault Records, and \"The Letter\", \"Do You Wanna Dance\" and \"Love Is Strange\", with Reprise Records.In September 1964, they released \"Baby Don\\'t Go\" under the name of Sonny & Cher, which became their first regional hit. The song was later included on the 1965 Reprise compilation Baby Don\\'t Go – Sonny & Cher and Friends, which also included songs from artists such as Bill Medley, The Lettermen and The Blendells.The duo released their first album Look at Us in the summer of 1965. The album contained the number one single \"I Got You Babe\". Look at Us peaked at number two on the Billboard chart for eight weeks in the later part of 1965.Sonny & Cher made their first promotional tour of Britain in the first two weeks of August 1965. The tour was organized and overseen by Larry Page, co-manager of the English rock band the Kinks, who met Cher a month earlier while she finished recording her debut album and while the Kinks toured America. Page and the Kinks\\' publicist Brian Sommerville quickly signed to be Sonny & Cher\\'s European business manager and British publicist, respectively. During their two weeks in Britain, the duo primarily appeared on British television and radio, but they also performed at the 100 Club in central London on August 5.The couple appeared on many of the top television shows of the era including The Ed Sullivan Show, American Bandstand, Where The Action Is, Hollywood A Go-Go, Hollywood Palace, Hullabaloo, Beat Club, Shindig!, Ready Steady Go! and Top of the Pops. They also appeared as themselves in the film Wild on the Beach, singing \"It\\'s Gonna Rain\". On their first album Bono also displayed his political interest long before running for Congress in the lyrics of the song, \"The Revolution Kind\".\\nAs the followup to the success of Look at Us, they released their second studio album in April 1966, The Wondrous World of Sonny & Chér, which peaked at number 34. The two dressed in animal skins with Bono wearing knee high caveman boots and Cher going barefoot.During 1965, five of their songs were in US Billboard Top 20, a record passed only by Elvis Presley and behind famous artists like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and others. Periodic solo releases by Cher continued during this period, including major successes with \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", and Burt Bacharach & Hal David\\'s theme from \"Alfie\" (as heard in the motion picture Alfie, as well as a single release), both in 1966. Because they sided with the young people being harassed on the Sunset Strip during the Sunset Strip curfew riots; they were removed from their promised position of honor in the Tournament of Roses Parade in January 1967.\\n\\n1967–1969: Career woes\\nIn 1967, Sonny and Cher released their third album, In Case You\\'re In Love. It peaked at number 45 in the U.S. charts. It contained two hit singles, both written by Bono, \"The Beat Goes On\" (No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100) and \"Little Man\" (No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100).\\nIn an attempt to capitalize on the duo\\'s initial success, Bono speedily arranged a film project for the duo to star in, but the 1967 feature, Good Times, was a major bomb, despite the efforts of fledgling director William Friedkin and co-star George Sanders. After Good Times flopped in 1968, Columbia Pictures immediately sold rights to their intended follow-up film Speedway to MGM. The couple were replaced by Elvis Presley and Nancy Sinatra. In 1969, another film, Chastity, starring Cher, written and produced by Sonny, was also a commercial bomb.Sonny and Cher\\'s career had stalled by 1968 as album sales quickly dried up. Their gentle, easy-listening pop sound and drug-free life had become unpopular in an era increasingly consumed with the psychedelic rock of the evolving landscape of American pop culture during the late 1960s.\\nBono decided to forge ahead, carving a new career for the duo in Las Vegas resorts, where they sharpened their public persona with Cher as the wise-cracking, glamorous singer, and Bono as the good-natured recipient of her insults. In reality, Bono controlled every aspect of their act, from the musical arrangements to the joke-writing. While success was slow to come, their luck improved when network TV talent scouts attended a show, noting their potential appeal for a variety series.\\nSonny and Cher also welcomed their first child, Chastity (named after Cher\\'s movie), born on March 4, 1969.\\n\\n1970–1977: TV success and divorce\\nIn 1970, Sonny and Cher starred in their first television special, The Nitty Gritty Hour, a mixture of slapstick comedy, skits, and live music. The appearance was a critical success, which led to numerous guest spots on other television shows. They also appeared in The New Scooby-Doo Movies as guest stars.\\nSonny and Cher caught the eye of CBS head of programming Fred Silverman while guest-hosting The Merv Griffin Show, and Silverman offered the duo their own variety show. The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour debuted in 1971 as a summer replacement series. The show returned to prime time later that year and was an immediate hit, quickly reaching the Top 10. The show received 15 Emmy Award nominations during its run, winning one for direction, throughout its initial four seasons on CBS. The duo also revived their recording career, releasing the album All I Ever Need Is You, and charting two more top ten hits: \"All I Ever Need Is You\", and \"A Cowboy\\'s Work Is Never Done\" in 1972.Sonny and Cher\\'s dialogues were patterned after the successful nightclub routines of Louis Prima and Keely Smith: the happy-go-lucky husband squelched by a tart remark from the unamused wife. The show featured a stock company of zany comedians, including Teri Garr, Freeman King, Ted Ziegler, Billy Van and Murray Langston (later The Unknown Comic on The Gong Show). One sketch satirizing CBS\\'s detective show Cannon and its portly star William Conrad was so successful that Sonny and Cher staged several follow-ups, with Tony Curtis as \"Detective Fat\". Everybody in these sketches wore wide-waisted \"fat suits\" (similar to hoop skirts), so Detective Fat and his clients and his suspects would spend most of the time bumping each other and bouncing across the crowded room.\\nBy the third season of the Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (1974), the marriage of Sonny and Cher was falling apart; the duo separated later that year. The show imploded, while still rating in the top 10. What followed was a very public divorce (finalized on June 26, 1975). Cher won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance By an Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour in 1974.\\n\\nBono launched his own show, The Sonny Comedy Revue, in the fall of 1974, retaining the \"Sonny and Cher\" troupe of comedians and writers. Cher also announced plans to star in a new variety series of her own. Critics predicted that Bono would be the big winner with a solo comedy vehicle, and held little hope for Cher\\'s more musical showcase. After only six weeks, however, Bono\\'s show was abruptly canceled.The Cher show debuted as an elaborate, all-star television special on February 16, 1975, featuring Flip Wilson, Bette Midler, and special guest Elton John. Cloris Leachman and Jack Albertson both won Emmy Awards for their appearances as guest-stars a few weeks later, and the series received four additional Emmy nominations that year. The first season ranked in the Top 25 of the year-end ratings.\\nAs a result of the divorce, Sonny and Cher went their separate ways until Cher attended the opening of one of Bono\\'s restaurants in something of a reconciliation. The Sonny & Cher Show returned in 1976, even though they were no longer married (the duo \"reunited\" with a humorous handshake). After struggling with low ratings through 1977, Sonny and Cher finally parted ways for good. In 1976, Mego Toys also released a line of toys and dolls, in the likeness of Sonny & Cher. The release of these fashion dolls coincided with the popularity of The Sonny & Cher Show.\\n\\n1978–1999: After Sonny and Cher\\nSonny Bono went on to an acting career and later entered politics, eventually becoming a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Cher went on to become a Grammy Award-winning solo singer and an Academy Award-winning actress.\\nThe couple made two surprise impromptu reunion performances: the first on The Mike Douglas Show in the spring of 1979, singing a medley of \"United We Stand\" and \"Without You\", and the second on November 13, 1987, on Late Night with David Letterman where they performed their hit song \"I Got You Babe\"; it turned out to be the last time the two would perform together.In early 1999, And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story, directed by David Burton Morris and starring Jay Underwood and Renee Faia, was broadcast on ABC. The TV movie was based on the autobiography of Bono, and focuses on the relationship between the couple during the early 1960s to their divorce in the mid 1970s. This movie was also nominated for two Emmy Awards.\\n\\nBono\\'s death, music copyright\\nOn January 5, 1998, Bono died of injuries from hitting a tree while skiing at Heavenly Ski Resort in Lake Tahoe. He was 62 years old. Bono\\'s death came just days after Michael Kennedy died in a similar accident. Bono\\'s widow, Mary, was selected to fill the remainder of his congressional term, and was re-elected in her own right, serving until she was defeated for re-election in 2012. She continues to champion many of her late husband\\'s causes, including the ongoing fight as how to best save the Salton Sea.\\nThe funeral, unbeknownst to Cher, was broadcast live on CNN. She gave a tearful eulogy, after which the attendees sang the song \"The Beat Goes On\". In front of millions, Cher tearfully and effusively praised Bono, calling him \"the most unforgettable character I\\'ve ever met\". His final resting place is Desert Memorial Park in nearby Cathedral City, California, the same cemetery in which Frank Sinatra was laid to rest later that same year. The epitaph on Bono\\'s headstone reads: \"And The Beat Goes On\".In 1998, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Cher appeared at the event with Mary Bono, who accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. Cher paid tribute to Bono in the CBS special Sonny and Me: Cher Remembers, calling her grief \"something I never plan to get over\". During the same year, Cher also released her twenty-second album Believe that was highly influenced by Bono\\'s death, and in the booklet Cher wrote \"In memory of Son\".When Cher and Bono divorced, they agreed to split revenue from the songs recorded together. When Bono died, one-third of his interest passed to wife Mary Bono, and one-sixth interests were split amongst his children. Cher sued UMG in 2009, claiming she and Bono\\'s heirs were owed $5,000,000 in \"hidden\" royalties.\\n\\nLegacy and achievements\\nAuthor Joseph Murrells described Sonny & Cher as \"part of the leading exponents of the rock-folk-message type of song, a hybrid combining the beat and instrumentation of rock music with folk lyrics and often lyrics of protest.\"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour received numerous Emmy nominations; Director Art Fisher won for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series in 1972.

Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times rated the film with 1 out of 5 stars. Shakti Salgaokar of DNA gave movie a one and half stars and wrote in his review, \"It\\'s simple — sexual innuendo, potshots at popular films, bad mimicry, foreign locations, a generous dose of overacting, an item song and a gora villain. And as he magnificently presents the climax of the film. Spare us the comedy, please?\" Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India said, \"This one\\'s definitely not for the fastidious, choosy viewer but for those who don\\'t mind losing it for a bit, Shakalaka Boom Boom works like an average Bollywood musical. Performance-wise, it\\'s one big circus with the guys hogging most of the limelight. The girls — Kangana and Celina — are mere confetti\" and gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Taran Adarsh also gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying \"It\\'s a well-crafted entertainer and lives up to the expectations of its target audience — the youth. At the box-office, its business at the multiplexes will help it generate good revenue, making it a profitable proposition for its investors.\"\\nPassage 14:\\nHe Comes Up Smiling\\nHe Comes Up Smiling is a 1918 American comedy film produced by and starring Douglas Fairbanks and directed by Allan Dwan.\\nThis film was based on a novel of the same title by Charles Sherman, which was adapted into a 1914 play of the same name by Byron Ongley and Emil Nyitray.
